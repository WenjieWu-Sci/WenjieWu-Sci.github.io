<p>2023-09-28, <strong>Cosmological constraints from density-split clustering in the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample</strong>, Enrique Paillas et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16541v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.16541v1</a></p>

<p>We present a clustering analysis of the BOSS DR12 CMASS galaxy sample, combining measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function and density-split clustering down to a scale of $1\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. Our theoretical framework is based on emulators trained on high-fidelity mock galaxy catalogues that forward model the cosmological dependence of the clustering statistics within an extended-$\Lambda$CDM framework, including redshift-space and Alcock-Paczynski distortions. Our base-$\Lambda$CDM analysis finds $\omega_{\rm cdm} = 0.1201\pm 0.0022$, $\sigma_8 = 0.792\pm 0.034$, and $n_s = 0.970\pm 0.018$, corresponding to $f\sigma_8 = 0.462\pm 0.020$ at $z \approx 0.525$, which is in agreement with Planck 2018 predictions and various clustering studies in the literature. We test single-parameter extensions to base-$\Lambda$CDM, varying the running of the spectral index, the dark energy equation of state, and the density of massless relic neutrinos, finding no compelling evidence for deviations from the base model. We model the galaxy-halo connection using a halo occupation distribution framework, finding signatures of environment-based assembly bias in the data. We validate our pipeline against mock catalogues that match the clustering and selection properties of CMASS, showing that we can recover unbiased cosmological constraints even with a volume 84 times larger than the one used in this study.</p>

<p>The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) is a radio-based ultra-high energy neutrino detector located at Summit Station, Greenland. It is still being constructed, with 7 stations currently operational. Neutrino detection works by measuring Askaryan radiation produced by neutrino-nucleon interactions. A neutrino candidate must be found amidst other backgrounds which are recorded at much higher rates – including cosmic-rays and anthropogenic noise – the origins of which are sometimes unknown. Here we describe a method to classify different noise classes using the latent space of a variational autoencoder. The latent space forms a compact representation that makes classification tractable. We analyze data from a noisy and a silent station. The method automatically detects and allows us to qualitatively separate multiple event classes, including physical wind-induced signals, for both the noisy and the quiet station.</p>

<p>2023-09-28, <strong>Conditional normalizing flows for IceCube event reconstruction</strong>, Thorsten Glüsenkamp et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16380v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.16380v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer high-energy neutrino detector deployed in the Antarctic ice. Two major event classes are charged-current electron and muon neutrino interactions. In this contribution, we discuss the inference of direction and energy for these classes using conditional normalizing flows. They allow to derive a posterior distribution for each individual event based on the raw data that can include systematic uncertainties, which makes them very promising for next-generation reconstructions. For each normalizing flow we use the differential entropy and the KL-divergence to its maximum entropy approximation to interpret the results. The normalizing flows correctly incorporate complex optical properties of the Antarctic ice and their relation to the embedded detector. For showers, the differential entropy increases in regions of high photon absorption and decreases in clear ice. For muons, the differential entropy strongly correlates with the contained track length. Coverage is maintained, even for low photon counts and highly asymmetrical contour shapes. For high-photon counts, the distributions get narrower and become more symmetrical, as expected from the asymptotic theorem of Bernstein-von-Mises. For shower directional reconstruction, we find the region between 1 TeV and 100 TeV to potentially benefit the most from normalizing flows because of azimuth-zenith asymmetries which have been neglected in previous analyses by assuming symmetrical contours. Events in this energy range play a vital role in the recent discovery of the galactic plane diffuse neutrino emission.</p>

<p>The Baikal-GVD is a deep-underwater neutrino telescope being constructed in Lake Baikal. After the winter 2023 deployment campaign the detector consists of 3456 optical modules installed on 96 vertical strings. The status of the detector and progress in data analysis are discussed in present report. The Baikal-GVD data collected in 2018-2022 indicate the presence of cosmic neutrino flux in high-energy cascade events consistent with observations by the IceCube neutrino telescope. Analysis of track-like events results in identification of first high-energy muon neutrino candidates. These and other results from 2018-2022 data samples are reviewed in this report.</p>

<p>We present the results of the two-year (2021-2022) monitoring of absorption and scattering lengths of light with wavelength 400-620 nm within the effective volume of the deep underwater neutrino telescope Baikal-GVD, which were measured by a device Baikal-5D No.2. The Baikal-5D No.2. was installed during the 2021 winter expedition at a depth of 1180 m. The absorption and scattering lengths were measured every week in 9 spectral points. The device Baikal-5D No.2 also has the ability to measure detailed scattering and absorption spectra. The data obtained make it possible to estimate the range of changes in the absorption and scattering lengths over a sufficiently long period of time and to investigate the relationship between the processes of changes in absorption and scattering. An analysis was made of changes in absorption and scattering spectra for the period 2021-2022.</p>

<p>The Baikal-GVD neutrino detector is a deep-underwater neutrino telescope under construction and recently after the winter 2023 deployment it consists of 3456 optical modules attached on 96 vertical strings. This 3-dimensional array of photo-sensors allows to observe ambient light in the vicinity of the Baikal-GVD telescope that is associated mostly with water luminescence. Results on time and space variations of the luminescent activity are reviewed based on data collected in 2018-2022.</p>

<p>2023-09-28, <strong>Hunting for sterile neutrino with collider signatures</strong>, Hao Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16233v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.16233v1</a></p>

<p>We study the feasibility to observe sterile neutrino at the high energy colliders, using direct production channels $e^+e^-\to\bar{\nu}_e N,\ e^-\gamma \to NW^-$ and indirect production channels through heavy meson/baryon and Higgs decay. We thus cover a mass window that is between what can be studied in heavy hadron factories and high energy colliders. For $e^+e^-\to\bar{\nu}_e N$ channel, the sensitivity of active-sterile mixing $|U_{eN}|^2$ in the lower mass end (0.3$\sim 2$ GeV) could be $10^{-6}$ at the SuperKEKB under its operation with designed luminosity, the sensitivity for hundreds GeV region can be further extended to $10^{-7}$ at the CEPC and the ILC. We also explore the heavy sterile neutrino production through $e^-\gamma \to NW^-$ channel at the ep collider, the mixing $|U_{eN}|^2$ is estimated to reach a sensitivity of $10^{-4}$ at the LHeC if $m_N$ to be electroweak energy mass scale, which can shed light on sterile neutrino searching at this mass region. For heavy hadron decay, the lepton-number-violating process in $|\Delta L|=2$ decays of $\Lambda_c, \Xi_{c}, \Xi_{cc}$ and $\Lambda_b$ are explored via an intermediate on-shell Majorana neutrino in GeV scale. The branching fractions and the lower-limit on $|U_{\ell N}|^2$ versus $m_N$ are given. The $Higgs \to W\mu\mu\pi$ channel is also considered, which is sensitive at lower mass scale.</p>

<p>2023-09-28, <strong>Subsurface cosmogenic and radiogenic production of ^{42}Ar</strong>, Sagar S. Poudel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16169v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.16169v1</a></p>

<p>Radioactive decays from ^{42}Ar and its progeny ^{42}K are potential background sources in large-scale liquid-argon-based neutrino and dark matter experiments. In the atmosphere, ^{42}Ar is produced primarily by cosmogenic activation on ^{40}Ar. The use of low radioactivity argon from cosmogenically shielded underground sources can expand the reach and sensitivity of liquid-argon-based rare event searches. We estimate ^{42}Ar production underground by nuclear reactions induced by natural radioactivity and cosmic-ray muon-induced interactions. At 3,000 mwe, ^{42}Ar production rate is 1.8E-3 atoms per ton of crust per year, 7 orders of magnitude smaller than the ^{39}Ar production rate at a similar depth in the crust. By comparing the calculated production rate of ^{42}Ar to that of ^{39}Ar for which the concentration has been measured in an underground gas sample, we estimate the activity of ^{42}Ar in gas extracted from 3,000 mwe depth to be less than 2 decays per ton of argon per year.</p>

<p>2023-09-28, <strong>Non-thermal WIMPy Baryogenesis with Primordial Black Hole</strong>, Ki-Young Choi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16122v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.16122v1</a></p>

<p>We consider the possibility that the weakly interacting massive particles produced from the evaporation of primordial black hole can explain both the relic density of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, through their annihilation which violate B and CP-symmetry. We find that the primordial black hole with mass less than $10^7 {\rm g}$ is a good candidate as an source of TeV dark matter with the total annihilation cross section $\left\langle\sigma_a \upsilon\right\rangle \lesssim 10^{-7} \ {\rm GeV}^{-2}$ and the B-violating scattering cross section $\left\langle\sigma_B \upsilon\right\rangle \lesssim 2\times 10^{-9} \ {\rm GeV^{-2}}$. This large annihilation cross section of dark matter in this model would make it available to search them in the indirect search for dark matter such as gamma-ray or neutrino observations.</p>

<p>2023-09-28, <strong>Higgs-Portal Dark Matter in Brane-World Cosmology</strong>, Taoli Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16625v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.16625v1</a></p>

<p>The Higgs-portal scalar dark matter (DM) model is a simple extension of the Standard Model (SM) to incorporate a DM particle to the SM, where a $Z_2$-odd real scalar field is introduced as a DM candidate. We consider this DM model in the context of 5-dimensional brane-world cosmology, where our 3-dimensional space is realized as a hyper-surface embedded in 4-dimensional space. In the setup, all the SM and DM fields reside on the hyper-surface while graviton lives in the bulk. We consider two well-known brane-world cosmologies, namely, the Randall-Sundrum (RS) and the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) brane-world cosmologies, in which the standard Big Bang cosmology is reproduced at low temperatures below the so-called ``transition temperature” while at high temperatures the expansion law of the universe is significantly modified. Such a non-standard expansion law directly impacts the prediction for the relic density of the Higgs-portal DM. We investigate the brane-world cosmological effects and identify the allowed model parameter region by combining the constraints from the observed DM relic density, and the direct and indirect DM detection experiments. It is well-known that only DM masses in the vicinity of half the Higgs boson mass are allowed in the Higgs-portal scalar DM model. We find that the allowed parameter region becomes more severely constrained and even disappears in the RS cosmology, while the GB cosmological effect significantly enlarges the allowed region. Upon discovering Higgs-portal DM, we can determine transition temperature in the GB brane-world cosmology.</p>

<p>2023-09-28, <strong>Constraining Ultralight Dark Matter through an Accelerated Resonant Search</strong>, Zitong Xu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16600v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.16600v1</a></p>

<p>Experiments aimed at detecting ultralight dark matter typically rely on resonant effects, which are sensitive to the dark matter mass that matches the resonance frequency. In this study, we investigate the nucleon couplings of ultralight axion dark matter using a magnetometer operating in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) mode. Our approach involves the use of a $^{21}$Ne spin-based sensor, which features the lowest nuclear magnetic moment among noble-gas spins. This configuration allows us to achieve an ultrahigh sensitivity of 0.73 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$ at around 5 Hz, corresponding to energy resolution of approximately 1.5$\times   10^{-23}\,\rm{eV/Hz^{1/2}}$. Our analysis reveals that under certain conditions it is beneficial to scan the frequency with steps significantly larger than the resonance width. The analytical results are in agreement with experimental data and the scan strategy is potentially applicable to other resonant searches. Further, our study establishes stringent constraints on axion-like particles (ALP) in the 4.5–15.5 Hz Compton-frequency range coupling to neutrons and protons, improving on prior work by several-fold. Within a band around 4.6–6.6 Hz and around 7.5 Hz, our laboratory findings surpass astrophysical limits derived from neutron-star cooling. Hence, we demonstrate an accelerated resonance search for ultralight dark matter, achieving an approximately 30-fold increase in scanning step while maintaining competitive sensitivity.</p>

<p>2023-09-28, <strong>Weak Deflection Angle, Hawking Radiation, Greybody Bound and Shadow Cast for Static Black Hole in the Framework of $f(R)$ Gravity</strong>, Surajit Mandal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16461v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.16461v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we probe the weak gravitational lensing by a static spherically symmetric black hole in view of $f(R)$ gravity in the background of the non-plasma medium (vacuum). We provide a discussion on a light ray in a static black hole solution in $f(R)$ gravity. To adore this purpose, we find the Gaussian optical curvature in weak gravitational lensing by utilizing the optical geometry of this black hole solution. Furthermore, we find the deflection angle in non-plasma medium up to the leading order by employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (considering Gibbons and Werner’s technique). We present the graphical analysis of the deflection angle with respect to the various parameters that govern the black hole. Further, we calculate the Hawking temperature for this black hole via a topological method and compare it with a standard method of deriving the Hawking temperature. We also analyze the Schr"odinger-like Regge-Wheeler equation and derive a bound on the greybody factor for a static black hole in the framework of $f(R)$ gravity and graphically inquire that bound converges to 1. We also investigate the silhouette or shadow generated by this static $f(R)$ black hole. Moreover, we constrain the non-negative real constant (linear dark-matter-related parameter for considered black hole) from the observed angular diameters of M87* and Sgr A* released by the EHT. Finally, we probe how cosmological constant, non-negative real constant and mass affected the radius of shadow.</p>

<p>2023-09-28, <strong>Primordial black holes in scalar field inflation coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term with fractional power-law potentials</strong>, Ali Ashrafzadeh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16356v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.16356v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, we investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in a scalar field inflationary model coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term with fractional power-law potentials. The coupling function enhances the curvature perturbations, then results in the generation of PBHs and detectable secondary gravitational waves (GWs). % We identify three separate sets of parameters for the potential functions of the form $\phi^{1/3}$, $\phi^{2/5}$, and $\phi^{2/3}$. By adjusting the model parameters, we decelerate the inflaton during the ultra slow-roll (USR) phase and enhance curvature perturbations. % Our calculations predict the formation of PBHs with masses of ${\cal O}(10)M_{\odot}$, which are compatible with LIGO-Virgo observational data. Additionally, we find PBHs with masses around ${\cal O}(10^{-6})M_{\odot}$ and ${\cal O}(10^{-5})M_{\odot}$, which can explain ultrashort-timescale microlensing events in OGLE data. % Furthermore, our proposed mechanism could lead to the formation of PBHs in mass scales around ${\cal O}(10^{-14})M_{\odot}$ and ${\cal O}(10^{-13})M_{\odot}$, contributing to approximately 99\% of the dark matter in the universe. % We also study the production of secondary GWs in our model. In all cases of the model, the density parameter of secondary GWs $\Omega_{\rm GW_0}$ exhibits peaks that intersect the sensitivity curves of GWs detectors, providing a means to verify our findings using data of these detectors. % Our numerical results demonstrate a power-law behavior for the spectra of $\Omega_{\rm GW_0}$ with respect to frequency, given by $\Omega_{\rm GW_0} (f) \sim (f/f_c)^{n}$. Additionally, in the infrared regime where $f\ll f_{c}$, the power index takes a log-dependent form, specifically $n=3-2/\ln(f_c/f)$.</p>

<p>2023-09-28, <strong>Simulated non-thermal emission from SNR G1.9+0.3</strong>, Marco A. Villagran et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16410v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.16410v1</a></p>

<p>Supernova remnants are the nebular leftover of defunct stellar environments, resulting from the interaction between a supernova blastwave and the circumstellar medium shaped by the progenitor throughout its life. They display a large variety of non-spherical morphologies such as ears that shine non-thermally. % We have modelled the structure and the non-thermal emission of the supernova remnant G1.9+0.3 through 3D magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations. We propose that the peculiar ear-shaped morphology of this supernova remnant results from the interaction of the its blast wave with a magnetized circumstellar medium, which was previously asymmetrically shaped by the past stellar wind emanating from the progenitor star or its stellar companion. We created synthetic non-thermal radio and x-ray maps from our simulated remnant structure, which are in qualitative agreement with observations, forming ears on the polar directions. Our synthetic map study explains the discrepancies between the measured non-thermal radio and X-ray surface brightness distributions assuming that the Inverse Compton process produces the observed X-ray emission.</p>

<p>2023-09-28, <strong>Internal Shocks Hydrodynamics: the Collision of Two Cold Shells in Detail</strong>, Sk. Minhajur Rahaman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16327v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.16327v1</a></p>

<p>Emission in many astrophysical transients originates from a shocked fluid. A central engine typically produces an outflow with varying speeds, leading to internal collisions within the outflow at finite distances from the source. Each such collision produces a pair of forward and reverse shocks with the two shocked regions separated by a contact discontinuity (CD). As a useful approximation, we consider the head-on collision between two cold and uniform shells (a slower leading shell and a faster trailing shell) of finite radial width, and study the dynamics of shock propagation in planar geometry. We find significant differences between the forward and reverse shocks, in terms of their strength, internal energy production efficiency, and the time it takes for the shocks to sweep through the respective shells. We consider the subsequent propagation of rarefaction waves in the shocked regions and explore the cases where these waves can catch up with the shock fronts and thereby limit the internal energy dissipation. We demonstrate the importance of energy transfer from the trailing to leading shell through $pdV$ work across the CD. We outline the parameter space regions relevant for models of different transients,e.g., Gamma-ray burst (GRB) internal shock model, fast radio burst (FRB) blastwave model, Giant flare due to magnetars, and superluminous supernovae (SLSN) ejecta. We find that the reverse shock likely dominates the internal energy production for many astrophysical transients.</p>

<p>2023-09-28, <strong>JWST reveals a luminous infrared source at the position of the failed supernova candidate N6946-BH1</strong>, Emma R. Beasor et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16121v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.16121v1</a></p>

<p>N6946-BH1 is the first plausible candidate for a failed supernova (SN), a peculiar event in which a massive star disappears without the expected bright SN, accompanied by collapse into a black hole (BH). Following a luminous outburst in 2009, the source experienced a significant decline in optical brightness, while maintaining a persistent infrared (IR) presence. While it was proposed to be a potential failed SN, such behavior has been observed in SN impostor events in nearby galaxies. Here, we present late-time observations of BH1, taken 14 years after disappearance, using JWST’s NIRCam and MIRI instruments to probe a never-before-observed region of the object’s spectral energy distribution. We show for the first time that all previous observations of BH1 (pre- and post-disappearance) are actually a blend of at least 3 sources. In the near-IR, BH1 is notably fainter than the progenitor but retains similar brightness to its state in 2017. In the mid-IR, the flux appears to have brightened compared to the inferred fluxes from the best-fitting progenitor model. The total luminosity of the source is between 13 - 25% that of the progenitor. We also show that the IR SED appears consistent with PAH features that arise when dust is illuminated by near-ultraviolet radiation. At present, the interpretation of N6946-BH1 remains uncertain. The observations match expectations for a stellar merger, but theoretical ambiguity in the failed SN hypothesis makes it hard to dismiss.</p>
