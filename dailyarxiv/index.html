<p>2023-05-23, <strong>Reheating process in the $R^2$ inflationary model with the baryogenesis scenario</strong>, Hyun Jeong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14273v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.14273v1</a></p>

<p>Post-inflationary evolution and (re)heating of the viable inflationary model, the $R^2$ one, is made more realistic by including the leptogenesis scenario into it. For this purpose, right-handed Majorana neutrinos with a large mass are added to the matter sector of the Standard Model to explain the neutrino oscillation experiments and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. We have found parameters that characterize this model: non-minimal coupling of the Higgs field $\xi$ and the mass of the right-handed Majorana neutrino $M_{N_\alpha}$. We have analyzed the effect of these parameters on the reheating process and the resultant physical quantities: spectral indices and baryon asymmetry.</p>

<p>2023-05-23, <strong>Dark Sectors with Mass Thresholds Face Cosmological Datasets</strong>, Itamar J. Allali et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14166v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.14166v1</a></p>

<p>Interacting dark sectors may undergo changes in the number of their relativistic species during the early universe, due to a mass threshold $m$ (similar to changes in the Standard Model bath), and in doing so affect the cosmic history. When such changes occur close to recombination, i.e., for $m\sim (0.1-10)~\text{eV}$, the stringent bound on the effective number of neutrino species, $N_{\text{eff}}$, can be relaxed and the value of the Hubble expansion rate $H_0$ inferred from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations raised. We search for such sectors (with and without mass thresholds) in the latest cosmological datasets, including the full-shape (FS) of BOSS DR12 galaxy power spectrum. We perform a detailed analysis, accounting for the choice of prior boundaries and additionally exploring the possible effects of dark sector interactions with (a fraction of) the dark matter. We find $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}\leq 0.55\, (0.46)$ at 95% C.L. with (without) a mass threshold. While a significantly larger Hubble rate is achieved in this scenario, $H_0=69.01^{+0.66}_{-1.1}$, the overall fit to CMB+FS data does not provide a compelling advantage over the $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, we find that dark matter interactions with the dark sector do not significantly improve the (matter fluctuations) $S_8$ tension with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our work provides model-independent constraints on (decoupled) dark sectors with mass thresholds around the eV scale.</p>

<p>2023-05-23, <strong>On the Dirac-Majorana neutrinos distinction in four-body decays</strong>, Juan Manuel Márquez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14140v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.14140v1</a></p>

<p>Motivated by the novel method discussed in arXiv:2106.11785 to differentiate the effects of Dirac and Majorana neutrinos in four-body decays, we propose to analyse radiative leptonic lepton-decays ($\ell\to\ell’\nu\bar{\nu}\gamma$), as an independent alternative process to study the possible Majorana nature of neutrinos. Following arXiv:2106.11785, the back-to-back kinematic scenario (for the $\ell’- \gamma$ and $\nu-\bar{\nu}$ systems, respectively) supposedly avoids the constraint imposed by the “practical Dirac-Majorana confusion theorem”, as one does not need to fully integrate over neutrino and antineutrino momenta. Our results show that, in this special kinematic configuration, the difference between Dirac and Majorana cases vanishes once the inaccessible neutrino angle is integrated out, which seems to be incompatible with the proposal in arXiv:2106.11785. We work on that and conclude that the discrepancy comes from the kinematic treatment, specifically from the angular integration and clarify these issues with consistency tests. All this applies in absence of non-standard interactions, which can enhance generally the sensitivity to the neutrino nature.</p>

<p>2023-05-23, <strong>Open system approach to Neutrino oscillations in a quantum walk framework</strong>, Himanshu Sahu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13923v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.13923v1</a></p>

<p>Quantum simulation provides a computationally-feasible approach to model and study many problems in chemistry, condensed-matter physics, or high-energy physics where quantum phenomenon define the systems behaviour. In high-energy physics, quite a few possible applications are investigated in the context of gauge theories and their application to dynamic problems, topological problems, high-baryon density configurations, or collective neutrino oscillations. In particular, schemes for simulating neutrino oscillations are proposed using a quantum walk framework. In this study, we approach the problem of simulating neutrino oscillation from the perspective of open quantum systems by treating the position space of quantum walk as environment. We have obtained the recurrence relation for Kraus operator which is used to represent the dynamics of the neutrino flavor change in the form of reduced coin states. We establish a connection between the dynamics of reduced coin state and neutrino phenomenology, enabling one to fix the simulation parameters for a given neutrino experiment and reduces the need for extended position space to simulate neutrino oscillations. We have also studied the behavior of linear entropy as a measure of entanglement between different flavors in the same framework.</p>

<p>2023-05-23, <strong>Electroweak Loop Contributions to the Direct Detection of Wino Dark Matter</strong>, John Ellis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13837v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.13837v1</a></p>

<p>Electroweak loop corrections to the matrix elements for the spin-independent scattering of cold dark matter particles on nuclei are generally small, typically below the uncertainty in the local density of cold dark matter. However, as shown in this paper, there are instances in which the electroweak loop corrections are relatively large, and change significantly the spin-independent dark matter scattering rate. An important example occurs when the dark matter particle is a wino, e.g., in anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) and pure gravity mediation (PGM) models. We find that the one-loop electroweak corrections to the spin-independent wino LSP scattering cross section generally interfere constructively with the tree-level contribution for AMSB models with negative Higgsino mixing, $\mu &lt; 0$, and in PGM-like models for both signs of $\mu$, lifting the cross section out of the neutrino fog and into a range that is potentially detectable in the next generation of direct searches for cold dark matter scattering.</p>

<p>2023-05-22, <strong>Diffuse Neutrino Flux Based on the Rates of Core-Collapse Supernovae and Black Hole Formation Deduced from a Novel Galactic Chemical Evolution Model</strong>, Yosuke Ashida et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13543v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.13543v1</a></p>

<p>Fluxes of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) are calculated based on a new modeling of galactic chemical evolution, where a variable stellar initial mass function (IMF) depending on the galaxy type is introduced and black hole (BH) formation from the failed supernova is considered for progenitors heavier than 18$M_{\odot}$. The flux calculations are performed for different combinations of the star formation rate, nuclear equation of state, and neutrino mass hierarchy to examine the systematic effects from these factors. In any case, our new model predicts the enhanced DSNB $\bar{\nu}_{e}$ flux at $E_\nu \gtsim 30$~MeV and $E_\nu \ltsim 10$~MeV due to more frequent BH formation and a larger core collapse rate at high redshifts in the early-type galaxies, respectively. Event rate spectra of the DSNB $\bar{\nu}_{e}$ at a detector from the new model are shown and detectability at water-based Cherenkov detectors, SK-Gd and Hyper-Kamiokande, is discussed. In order to investigate impacts of the assumptions in the new model, we prepare alternative models based on the different IMF form and treatment of BH formation, and estimate discrimination capabilities between the new and alternative models at these detectors.</p>

<p>2023-05-22, <strong>Phenomenological aspects of the fermion and scalar sectors of a $S_4$ flavored 3-3-1 model</strong>, A. E. Cárcamo Hernández et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13441v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.13441v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a viable and predictive model based on the $SU(3)_C \times SU(3)_L \times U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry, supplemented by the global $U(1)_{Lg}$ symmetry, the $S_4$ family symmetry and several auxiliary cyclic symmetries, which successfully reproduces the observed SM fermion mass and mixing pattern. The SM charged fermion mass and quark mixing hierarchy is caused by the spontaneous breaking of the discrete symmetries, whereas the tiny active neutrino masses are generated through an inverse seesaw mechanism mediated by right-handed Majorana neutrinos. The model is consistent with the SM fermion masses and mixings and successfully accommodates the current Higgs diphoton decay rate constraints as well as the constraints arising from oblique $S$, $T$ and $U$ parameters and meson oscillations.</p>

<p>2023-05-22, <strong>Swift: A modern highly-parallel gravity and smoothed particle hydrodynamics solver for astrophysical and cosmological applications</strong>, Matthieu Schaller et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13380v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.13380v1</a></p>

<p>Numerical simulations have become one of the key tools used by theorists in all the fields of astrophysics and cosmology. The development of modern tools that target the largest existing computing systems and exploit state-of-the-art numerical methods and algorithms is thus crucial. In this paper, we introduce the fully open-source highly-parallel, versatile, and modular coupled hydrodynamics, gravity, cosmology, and galaxy-formation code Swift. The software package exploits hybrid task-based parallelism, asynchronous communications, and domain-decomposition algorithms based on balancing the workload, rather than the data, to efficiently exploit modern high-performance computing cluster architectures. Gravity is solved for using a fast-multipole-method, optionally coupled to a particle mesh solver in Fourier space to handle periodic volumes. For gas evolution, multiple modern flavours of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics are implemented. Swift also evolves neutrinos using a state-of-the-art particle-based method. Two complementary networks of sub-grid models for galaxy formation as well as extensions to simulate planetary physics are also released as part of the code. An extensive set of output options, including snapshots, light-cones, power spectra, and a coupling to structure finders are also included. We describe the overall code architecture, summarize the consistency and accuracy tests that were performed, and demonstrate the excellent weak-scaling performance of the code using a representative cosmological hydrodynamical problem with $\approx$$300$ billion particles. The code is released to the community alongside extensive documentation for both users and developers, a large selection of example test problems, and a suite of tools to aid in the analysis of large simulations run with Swift.</p>

<p>2023-05-22, <strong>Local clustering of relic neutrinos with kinetic field theory</strong>, Emil Brinch Holm et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13379v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.13379v1</a></p>

<p>The density of relic neutrinos is expected to be enhanced due to clustering in our local neighbourhood at Earth. We introduce a novel analytical technique to calculate the neutrino overdensity, based on kinetic field theory. Kinetic field theory is a particle-based theory for cosmic structure formation and in this work we apply it for the first time to massive neutrinos. The gravitational interaction is expanded in a perturbation series and we take into account the first-order contribution to the local density of relic neutrinos. For neutrino masses that are consistent with cosmological neutrino mass bounds, our results are in excellent agreement with state-of-the-art calculations.</p>

<p>2023-05-22, <strong>Limits on light primordial black holes from high-scale leptogenesis</strong>, Roberta Calabrese et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13369v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.13369v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the role that the evaporation of light primordial black holes may have played in the production of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through the high-scale leptogenesis. In particular, for mass of primordial black hole in the range [$10^6$-$10^9$] g, we find a dilution of thermally generated lepton asymmetry via entropy injection in the primordial plasma after the sphaleron freeze-out. As a consequence, we can put strong constraints on the primordial black hole parameters, showing the mutual exclusion limits between primordial black holes and high-scale leptogenesis. Remarkably, we point out an interplay between the upper bound on the initial abundance of primordial black holes and the active neutrino mass scale.</p>

<p>2023-05-22, <strong>Weighing neutrinos at the damping tail</strong>, Eleonora Di Valentino et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12989v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.12989v1</a></p>

<p>Model-independent mass limits assess the robustness of current cosmological measurements of the neutrino mass scale. Consistency between high-multipole and low-multiple Cosmic Microwave Background observations measuring such scale further valuate the constraining power of present data. We derive here up-to-date limits on neutrino masses and abundances exploiting either the Data Release 4 of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) or the South Pole Telescope polarization measurements from SPT-3G, envisaging different non-minimal background cosmologies and marginalizing over them. Both the most constraining and marginalized bounds are competitive with those found with Planck data: we obtain $\sum m_\nu &lt;0.139$ eV and $N_{\textrm{eff}}= 2.82\pm 0.25$ in a dark energy quintessence scenario, both at $95\%$ CL. These limits translate into $\sum m_\nu &lt;0.20$ eV and $N_{\textrm{eff}}= 2.79^{+0.30}_{-0.28}$ after marginalizing over a plethora of well-motivated fiducial models. Our findings reassess both the strength and the reliability of cosmological neutrino mass constraints.</p>

<p>2023-05-22, <strong>Revisiting coupled CDM-massive neutrino perturbations in diverse cosmological backgrounds</strong>, Sourav Pal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12830v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.12830v1</a></p>

<p>Massive neutrinos are well-known to cause a characteristic suppression in the growth of structures at scales below the neutrino free-streaming length. A detailed understanding of this suppression is essential in the era of precision cosmology we are entering into, enabling us to better constrain the total neutrino mass and possibly probe (beyond)-$\Lambda$CDM cosmological model(s). Instead of the usual N-body simulation or Boltzmann solver, in this article we consider a two-fluid framework at the linear scales, where the neutrino fluid perturbations are coupled to the CDM (+ baryon) fluid via gravity at redshifts of interest. Treating the neutrino mass fraction $f_\nu$ as a perturbative parameter, we find a fully analytic solution to the system with redshift-dependent neutrino free-streaming length in $\Lambda$CDM background. The perturbative scale-dependent solution is shown to be in excellent agreement with numerical solution of the two-fluid equations valid to all orders in $f_{\nu}$, and also agrees with results from {\texttt{CLASS}} to a good accuracy. We further generalize the framework to incorporate different evolving dark energy backgrounds and found sub-percent level differences in the suppression, all of which lie within the observational uncertainty of BOSS-like surveys. We also present a brief discussion on the prospects of the current analysis in the context of upcoming missions.</p>

<p>2023-05-22, <strong>Challenges in Neutrino Mass Measurements</strong>, Jyotsna Singh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12654v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.12654v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino masses are yet unknown. We discuss the present state of absolute neutrino mass from $\beta$ decay experiments; effective Majorana neutrino mass from neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments; neutrino mass squared differences from neutrino oscillation: solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator based experiments; sum of neutrino masses from cosmological observations. Current experimental challenges in the determination of neutrino masses are briefly discussed. The main focus is devoted to contemporary experiments.</p>

<p>2023-05-23, <strong>Observational Constraints on Yukawa Cosmology and Connection with Black Hole Shadows</strong>, Esteban González et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14305v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.14305v1</a></p>

<p>This research explores a cosmological model proposed in arXiv:2304.11492 by Jusufi et al., which challenges the existence of dark matter and proposes a connection between dark matter, dark energy, and baryonic matter by altering Newton’s law of gravity in large-scale structures. The model is described by a Yukawa-like gravitational potential with the coupling parameter $\alpha$ and wavelength parameter $\lambda$. Utilizing observational data from Supernovae Ia and $H(z)$ within a $1\sigma$ CL, the study determines the best-fit parameters, resulting in $\lambda=2693_{-1262}^{+1191}\, \rm Mpc$, $\alpha=0.416_{-0.326}^{+1.137}$, and a graviton mass of approximately $m_g \simeq 10^{-69}$ kg. The research also establishes a direct connection between the dark matter/dark energy density parameters and the angular radius of the black hole shadow of the SgrA and M87 black holes in the low-redshift limit, which is consistent with the findings of the Event Horizon Telescope. This discovery holds significant importance in the paper, as it challenges the conventional understanding of the universe’s composition and gravitational forces.</p>

<p>2023-05-23, <strong>Axion Poltergeist</strong>, Keisuke Harigaya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14242v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.14242v1</a></p>

<p>Rotations of axion fields in the early universe can produce dark matter and the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. We point out that the rotation can generate an observable amount of a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background. It can be doubly enhanced in a class of models in which the equation of state of the rotations rapidly changes from a non-relativistic matter-like one to a kination-like one by 1) the so-called Poltergeist mechanism and 2) slower redshift of GWs compared to the axion kination fluid. In supersymmetric UV completion, future GW observations can probe the supersymmetry-breaking scale up to $10^7\,$GeV even if the axion does not directly couple to the Standard Model fields.</p>

<p>2023-05-23, <strong>Impacts of symmetry energy slope on the oscillation frequencies of neutron stars with short-range correlation and admixed dark matter</strong>, Bin Hong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14101v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.14101v1</a></p>

<p>Oscillation modes of compact stars, in general, can serve as a fingerprint in determining the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter. In this study, we examine the impact of symmetry energy slope ($L$) on the oscillation frequencies of neutron stars (NSs) with nucleon-nucleon short range correlation (SRC) and admixed dark matter (DM) for the first time within the relativistic mean-field theory. By adjusting the $L$, we revise the EOS and coupling parameters in light of the SRC and DM effects, and construct the new sets. The results reveal that NSs containing SRC and DM inside are more likely to satisfy the observational constraints, and we find that smaller $L$ exhibits larger fundamental non-radial and radial frequencies, and that the effect on Large Separation (LG) is also mainly concentrated in the low-mass region. Moreover, we update the linear relationship between the non-radial frequency and mean density, and we further give empirical relations between non-radial and radial frequencies and tidal deformability at different $L$ for 1.4$M_{\odot}$ and 2$M_{\odot}$. These findings will enable us to more effectively confine the NS EOSs, in turn, also provide a strategy to place constraints on the $L$.</p>

<p>We look for possible evidence of a non-minimal coupling (NMC) between dark matter (DM) and gravity using data from the X-COP compilation of galaxy clusters. We consider a theoretically motivated NMC that may dynamically arise from the collective behavior of the coarse-grained DM field (e.g., via Bose-Einstein condensation) with averaging/coherence length $\L_{\mathrm{nmc}}$. In the Newtonian limit, the NMC modifies the Poisson equation by a term $\L_{\mathrm{nmc}}^2 \nabla^2 \rho$ proportional to the Laplacian of the DM density itself. We show that this term when acting as a perturbation over the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile of cold DM particles, can yield DM halo density profiles capable of correctly fitting galaxy clusters’ pressure profiles with an accuracy comparable and in some cases even better than the standard cold DM NFW profile. We also show that the observed relation between the non-minimal coupling length scale and the virial mass found in Gandolfi et al., 2022 for Late Type Galaxies is consistent with the relation we find in the current work, suggesting that the previously determined power-law scaling law holds up to galaxy cluster mass scales.</p>

<p>The galaxy-galaxy lensing technique allows us to measure the subhalo mass of satellite galaxies, studying their mass loss and evolution within galaxy clusters and providing direct observational validation for theories of galaxy formation. In this study, we use the weak gravitational lensing observations from DECaLS DR8, in combination with the redMaPPer galaxy cluster catalog from SDSS DR8 to accurately measure the dark matter halo mass of satellite galaxies. We confirm a significant increase in the stellar-to-halo mass ratio of satellite galaxies with their halo-centric radius, indicating clear evidence of mass loss due to tidal stripping. Additionally, we find that this mass loss is strongly dependent on the mass of the satellite galaxies, with satellite galaxies above $10^{11}~{\rm M_{\odot}/h}$ experiencing more pronounced mass loss compared to lower mass satellites, reaching 86\% at projected halo-centric radius $0.5R_{\rm 200c}$. The average mass loss rate, when not considering halo-centric radius, displays a U-shaped variation with stellar mass, with galaxies of approximately $4\times10^{10}~{\rm M_{\odot}/h}$ exhibiting the least mass loss, around 60\%. We compare our results with state-of-the-art hydrodynamical numerical simulations and find that the satellite galaxy stellar-to-halo mass ratio in the outskirts of galaxy clusters is higher compared to the predictions of the Illustris-TNG project about factor 5. Furthermore, the Illustris-TNG project’s numerical simulations did not predict the observed dependence of satellite galaxy mass loss rate on satellite galaxy mass.</p>

Buzulutskov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13692v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.13692v1</a></p>

<p>The recent studies of electroluminescence (EL) properties in two-phase argon detectors for dark matter searches have revealed the presence of unusual delayed pulses in the EL signal in the form of two slow components with time constants of about 5 and 50 $\mu$s. These components were shown to be present in the charge signal itself, which clearly indicates that drifting electrons are temporarily trapped on two states of metastable negative argon ions which have never been observed before. In this work, using the pressure dependence of the ratio of slow component contributions measured in experiment, it is shown that these states are those of two types of metastable negative molecular ions, $\mathrm{Ar}_2^{<em>-}(b \ ^4\Sigma_u^-)$ and $\mathrm{Ar}_2^{</em>-}(a \ ^4\Sigma_g^+)$ for the higher and lower energy level respectively.</p>

<p>Black holes may form in present-day collapse of microscopic structures of dark matter. We show that, if microstructure black holes (MSBH) with mass $m\sim 10^{13}~g$ are produced, the spectrum of gamma rays from their evaporation agrees remarkably well with the GeV excess observed by Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, while still avoiding all observational constraints. We also discuss the generic requirements for MSBHs to explain the GeV excess.</p>

<p>Black holes can be produced in collapse of small-scale dark matter structures, which can happen at any time from the early to present-day universe. Microstructure black holes (MSBHs) can have a wide range of masses. Small MSBHs evaporate via Hawking radiation with lifetimes shorter than the age of the universe, but they are not subject to the usual early-universe bounds on the abundance of small primordial black holes. We investigate the possible signal of such a population of exploding, late-forming black holes, constraining their abundance with observations from diffuse extragalactic gamma- and x-ray sources, the galactic center, and dwarf spheroidal galaxies.</p>

<p>2023-05-22, <strong>Indirect Detection of Decaying Dark Matter with High Angular Resolution: Case for axion search by IRCS at Subaru Telescope</strong>, Wen Yin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13415v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.13415v1</a></p>

<p>Recent advances in cosmic-ray detectors have provided exceptional sensitivities of dark matter with high angular resolution. Motivated by this, we present a comprehensive study of cosmic-ray flux from dark matter decay in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), with a focus on detectors possessing arcsecond-level field of view and/or angular resolution. We propose to use differential $D$-factors, which are estimated for various dSphs since such detectors are sensitive to their dark matter distributions. Our findings reveal that the resulting signal flux can experience a more than $O$(1-10) enhancement with different theoretical uncertainty compared to traditional estimations. Based on this analysis, we find that the Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) installed on the 8.2m Subaru telescope can be a good dark matter detector for the mass in the eV range, particularly axion-like particles (ALPs). Observing the Draco or Ursa Major II galaxies with the IRCS for just a few nights will be sufficient to surpass the stellar cooling bounds for ALP dark matter with a mass in the range of $1\,{\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 2\,\rm eV$.</p>

<p>We revise primordial black holes (PBHs) production in the axion-curvaton model, in light of recent developments in the computation of their abundance accounting for non-gaussianities (NGs) in the curvature perturbation up to all orders. We find that NGs intrinsically generated in such scenarios have a relevant impact on the phenomenology associated to PBHs and, in particular, on the relation between the abundance and the signal of second-order gravitational waves. We show that this model could explain both the totality of dark matter in the asteroid mass range and the tentative signal reported by the NANOGrav and IPTA collaborations in the nano-Hz frequency range. En route, we provide a new, explicit computation of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations going beyond the sudden-decay approximation.</p>

<p>2023-05-22, <strong>Spin-2 dark matter from inflation</strong>, Mohammad Ali Gorji et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13381v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.13381v1</a></p>

<p>The seed of dark matter can be generated from light spectator fields during inflation through a similar mechanism that the seed of observed large scale structures are produced from the inflaton field. The accumulated energy density of the corresponding excited modes, which is subdominant during inflation, dominates energy density of the universe later around the time of matter and radiation equality and plays the role of dark matter. For spin-2 spectator fields, Higuchi bound may seem to prevent excitation of such light modes since deviation of the inflationary background from the exact de Sitter spacetime is very small. However, sizable interactions with the inflaton field breaks (part of) isometries of the de Sitter space in the inflationary background and relaxes the Higuchi bound. Looking for this possibility in the context of effective field theory of inflation, we suggest a dark matter model consisting of spin-2 particles that produce during inflation.</p>

<p>We propose a novel framework where baryon asymmetry can arise due to forbidden decay of dark matter (DM) enabled by finite temperature effects in the early universe. In order to implement it in a realistic setup, we consider the DM to be a singlet Dirac fermion which acquires a dark asymmetry from a scalar field $\Phi$ via Affleck-Dine mechanism. Due to finite-temperature effects, DM can decay in the early universe into leptons and a second Higgs doublet thereby transferring a part of the dark asymmetry into lepton asymmetry with the latter getting converted into baryon asymmetry subsequently via electroweak sphalerons. DM becomes stable below a critical temperature leading to a stable relic. While the scalar field $\Phi$ can play the role of inflaton with specific predictions for inflationary parameters, the setup also remains verifiable via astrophysical as well as laboratory based observations.</p>

<p>2023-05-22, <strong>Measuring the dynamical length of galactic bars</strong>, Michael S. Petersen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13366v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.13366v1</a></p>

<p>We define a physically-motivated measure for galactic bar length, called the dynamical length. The dynamical length of the bar corresponds to the radial extent of the orbits that are the backbone supporting the bar feature. We propose a direct observational technique using integral field unit spectroscopy to measure it. Identifying these orbits and using the dynamical length is a more faithful tracer of the secular evolution and influence of the bar. We demonstrate the success of the metric for recovering the maximal bar-parenting orbit in a range of simulations, and to show its promise we perform its measurement on a real galaxy. We also study the difference between traditionally used ellipse fit approaches to determine bar length and the dynamical length proposed here in a wide range of bar-forming N-body simulations of a stellar disc and dark matter halo. We find that ellipse fitting may severely overestimate measurements of the bar length by a factor of 1.5-2.5 relative to the extent of the orbits that are trapped and actually comprise the bar. This bias leads to overestimates of both bar mass and the ratio of corotation radius to bar length, i.e. the bar speed, affecting inferences about the evolution of bars in the real universe.</p>

<p>2023-05-22, <strong>Mapping Dark Matter in the Milky Way using Normalizing Flows and Gaia DR3</strong>, Sung Hak Lim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13358v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.13358v1</a></p>

<p>We present a novel, data-driven analysis of Galactic dynamics, using unsupervised machine learning – in the form of density estimation with normalizing flows – to learn the underlying phase space distribution of 6 million nearby stars from the Gaia DR3 catalog. Solving the collisionless Boltzmann equation with the assumption of approximate equilibrium, we calculate – for the first time ever – a model-free, unbinned, fully 3D map of the local acceleration and mass density fields within a 3 kpc sphere around the Sun. As our approach makes no assumptions about symmetries, we can test for signs of disequilibrium in our results. We find our results are consistent with equilibrium at the 10% level, limited by the current precision of the normalizing flows. After subtracting the known contribution of stars and gas from the calculated mass density, we find clear evidence for dark matter throughout the analyzed volume. Assuming spherical symmetry and averaging mass density measurements, we find a local dark matter density of $0.47\pm 0.05\;\mathrm{GeV/cm}^3$. We fit our results to a generalized NFW, and find a profile broadly consistent with other recent analyses.</p>

<p>It is well known that the first structures that form from small fluctuations in a self-gravitating, collisionless and initially smooth cold dark matter (CDM) fluid are pancakes. We study the gravitational force generated by such pancakes just after shell-crossing, and find a simple analytical formula for the force along the collapse direction, which can be applied to both the single- and multi-stream regimes. The formula is tested on the early growth of CDM protohaloes seeded by two or three crossed sine waves. Adopting the high-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) solution as a proxy for the dynamics, we confirm that our analytical prediction agrees well with the exact solution computed by direct resolution of the Poisson equation, as long as the caustic structure remains locally sufficiently one-dimensional. These results are further confirmed by comparisons of the LPT predictions performed this way to measurements in Vlasov simulations performed with the public code ColDICE. We also show that the component of the force orthogonal to the collapse direction preserves its single stream nature by not changing qualitatively before and after the collapse, allowing sufficiently high-order LPT acceleration to be used to approximate it accurately as long as the LPT series converges. As expected, solving Poisson equation on the density field generated with LPT displacement provides a more accurate force than the LPT acceleration itself, as a direct consequence of the faster convergence of the LPT series for the positions than for the accelerations. This may provide a clue on improving standard LPT predictions. Our investigations represent a very needed first step to study analytically gravitational dynamics in the multi-stream regime, by estimating, at leading order in time and space the proper backreaction on the gravitational field inside the pancakes.</p>

<p>2023-05-22, <strong>Clustering of Primordial Black Holes from QCD Axion Bubbles</strong>, Kentaro Kasai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13023v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.13023v1</a></p>

<p>We study the clustering of primordial black holes (PBHs) and axion miniclusters produced in the model proposed to explain the LIGO/Virgo events or the seeds of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in arXiv:2006.13137. It is found that this model predicts large isocurvature perturbations due to the clustering of PBHs and axion miniclusters, from which we obtain stringent constraints on the model parameters. Specifically, for the axion decay constant $f_a=10^{16}~\mathrm{GeV}$, which potentially accounts for the seeds of the SMBHs, the PBH fraction in dark matter should be $f_\mathrm{PBH}\lesssim7\times 10^{-10}$. Assuming that the mass of PBHs increases by more than a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ due to accretion, this is consistent with the observed abundance of SMBHs. On the other hand, for $f_a=10^{17}~\mathrm{GeV}$ required to produce PBHs of masses detected in the LIGO/Virgo, the PBH fraction should be $f_\mathrm{PBH}\lesssim6\times 10^{-8}$, which may be too small to explain the LIGO/Virgo events, although there is a significant uncertainty in calculating the merger rate in the presence of clustering.</p>

<p>2023-05-22, <strong>Halo formation and evolution in SFDM and CDM: new insights from the fluid approach</strong>, Horst Foidl et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12982v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.12982v1</a></p>

<p>(abridged) We present simulations of halo formation and evolution in scalar field dark matter (SFDM) cosmologies in the Thomas-Fermi regime, aka <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SFDM-TF", where a strong repulsive 2-particle self-interaction (SI) is included, being a valuable alternative to CDM, with the potential to resolve its</code>cusp-core” problem. In general, SFDM behaves like a quantum fluid. Previous literature has presented two fluid approximations for SFDM-TF, as well as simulations of halo formation. These results confirmed earlier expectations and are generally in mutual agreement, but discrepancies were also reported. Therefore, we perform dedicated 3D cosmological simulations for the SFDM-TF model, applying both fluid approximations, as well as for CDM. Our results are very well in accordance with previous works and extend upon them, in that we can explain the reported discrepancies as a result of different simulation setups. We find some interesting details: The evolution of both SFDM-TF and CDM halos follows a 2-stage process. In the early stage, the density profile in the center becomes close to a $(n=1.5)$-polytropic core, dominated by an “effective” velocity-dispersion pressure $P_{\sigma}$ which is common to both dark matter models. Consecutively, for CDM halos, the core transitions into a central cusp. In SFDM-TF halos, the additional pressure $P_\text{SI}$ due to SI determines the second stage of the evolution, where the central region follows closely a $(n=1)$-polytropic core, embedded in a nearly isothermal envelope, i.e. the outskirts are similar to CDM. We also encounter a new effect, namely a late-time expansion of both polytropic core plus envelope, because the size of the almost isothermal halo envelope is affected by the expansion of the background universe. So, an initial primordial core of $\sim 100$ pc can evolve into a larger core of $\gtrsim 1$ kpc, even without feedback from baryons.</p>

<p>A search for dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson in final states with two hadronically decaying $\tau$-leptons and missing transverse momentum is presented. The analysis uses $139$ fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider between 2015 and 2018. No evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model is found. The results are interpreted in terms of a 2HDM+$a$ model. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level are derived. Model-independent limits are also set on the visible cross section for processes beyond the Standard Model producing missing transverse momentum in association with a Higgs boson decaying to $\tau$-leptons.</p>

<p>The growth-rate $f\sigma_8(z)$ of the large-scale structure of the Universe is an important dynamic probe of gravity that can be used to test for deviations from General Relativity. However, in order for galaxy surveys to extract this key quantity from cosmological observations, two important assumptions have to be made: i) a fiducial cosmological model, typically taken to be the cosmological constant and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and ii) the modeling of the observed power spectrum from H$\alpha$ emitters, especially at non-linear scales, which is particularly dangerous as most models used in the literature are phenomenological at best. In this work, we propose a novel approach involving convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained on the Quijote N-body simulations, to predict $f\sigma_8(z)$ directly and without assuming a model for the non-linear part of the power spectrum, thus avoiding the second of the aforementioned assumptions. We find that the predictions for the value of $f\sigma_8$ from the CNN are in excellent agreement with the fiducial values, while the errors are within a factor of order unity from those of the traditionally optimistic Fisher matrix approach, assuming an ideal fiducial survey matching the specifications of the Quijote simulations. Thus, we find the CNN reconstructions provide a viable alternative in order to avoid the theoretical modeling of the non-linearities at small scales when extracting the growth-rate.</p>

A first demonstrator of the piezo drives, specifically developed for MADMAX, was tested at room temperature as well as at cryogenic temperatures down to 4.5 K and inside strong magnetic fields up to 5.3 T. These qualification measurements prove that the piezo-based linear stage is suited for MADMAX and fulfills the requirements.</p>

<p>For the light relativistic dark matter (DM) boosted by high energy cosmic ray, its scattering cross section with the nucleon is sensitively dependent on the momentum-transfer and such an dependence is caused by the mediator in the scattering. For puffy DM particle with a size, the momentum-transfer dependence can also arise from the DM radius effect. All these momentum-transfer dependences should be considered. In this note we study the direct detection limits on the cosmic ray-boosted puffy DM for a simplified model with a light mediator. For comparison, we first re-derive the direct detection limits on the cosmic ray-boosted point-like DM. We display the limits on various planes of parameters and find that the limits for the cosmic ray-boosted puffy DM are stronger than for the point-like DM.</p>

<p>This research explores a cosmological model proposed in arXiv:2304.11492 by Jusufi et al., which challenges the existence of dark matter and proposes a connection between dark matter, dark energy, and baryonic matter by altering Newton’s law of gravity in large-scale structures. The model is described by a Yukawa-like gravitational potential with the coupling parameter $\alpha$ and wavelength parameter $\lambda$. Utilizing observational data from Supernovae Ia and $H(z)$ within a $1\sigma$ CL, the study determines the best-fit parameters, resulting in $\lambda=2693_{-1262}^{+1191}\, \rm Mpc$, $\alpha=0.416_{-0.326}^{+1.137}$, and a graviton mass of approximately $m_g \simeq 10^{-69}$ kg. The research also establishes a direct connection between the dark matter/dark energy density parameters and the angular radius of the black hole shadow of the SgrA and M87 black holes in the low-redshift limit, which is consistent with the findings of the Event Horizon Telescope. This discovery holds significant importance in the paper, as it challenges the conventional understanding of the universe’s composition and gravitational forces.</p>

<p>2023-05-23, <strong>A partially stripped massive star in a Be binary at low metallicity: A missing link towards Be X-ray binaries and double neutron star mergers</strong>, V. Ramachandran et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14262v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.14262v1</a></p>

<p>Standard binary evolutionary models predict a significant population of core helium-burning stars that lost their hydrogen-rich envelope after mass transfer via Roche-lobe overflow. However, there is a scarcity of observations of such stripped stars in the intermediate mass regime (~1.5 - 8$ M_{\odot}$), which are thought to be prominent progenitors of SN Ib/c. Especially at low metallicity, a significant fraction of these stars is expected to be only partially stripped, retaining a significant amount of hydrogen on their surfaces. For the first time, we discovered a partially stripped massive star in a binary with a Be-type companion located in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using a detailed spectroscopic analysis. The stripped-star nature of the primary is revealed by the extreme CNO abundance pattern and very high luminosity-to-mass ratio, which suggest that the primary is likely shell-hydrogen burning. Our target SMCSGS-FS 69 is the most luminous and most massive system among the known stripped star + Be binaries, with Mstripped ~3$ M_{\odot}$ and MBe ~17$ M_{\odot}$. Binary evolutionary tracks suggest an initial mass of Mini $\gtrsim 12 M_{\odot}$ for the stripped star and predict it to be in a transition phase towards a hot compact He star, which will eventually produce a stripped-envelope supernova. Our target marks the first representative of a so-far missing evolutionary stage in the formation pathway of Be X-ray binaries and double neutron star mergers.</p>

<p>2023-05-23, <strong>Reeling in the Whirlpool: the distance to M 51 clarified by Cepheids and the Type IIP SN 2005cs</strong>, G. Csörnyei et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13943v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.13943v1</a></p>

<p>Despite being one of the best-known galaxies, the distance to the Whirlpool Galaxy, M 51, is still debated. Current estimates range from 6.02 to 9.09 Mpc, and different methods yield discrepant results. No Cepheid distance has been published for M 51 to date. We aim to estimate a more reliable distance to M 51 through two independent methods: Cepheid variables and their period-luminosity relation, and an augmented version of the expanding photosphere method (EPM) on the Type IIP SN 2005cs. For the Cepheid variables, we analyse a recently published HST catalogue of stars in M 51. By applying light curve and colour-magnitude diagram-based filtering, we select a high-quality sample of M 51 Cepheids to estimate the distance through the period-luminosity relation. For SN 2005cs, an emulator-based spectral fitting technique is applied, which allows for the fast and reliable estimation of physical parameters of the supernova atmosphere. We augment the established framework of EPM with these spectral models to obtain a precise distance to M 51. The two resulting distance estimates are D_Cep = 7.59 +/- 0.30 Mpc and D_2005cs = 7.34 +/- 0.39 Mpc using the Cepheid period-luminosity relation and the spectral modelling of SN 2005cs respectively. This is the first published Cepheid distance for this galaxy. Given that these two estimates are completely independent, one may combine them, which yields D_M51 = 7.50 +/- 0.24 Mpc (3.2% uncertainty). Our distance estimates are in agreement with most of the results obtained previously for M 51, while being more precise than the earlier counterparts. They are however significantly lower than the TRGB estimates, which are often adopted for the distance to this galaxy. The results highlight the importance of direct cross-checks between independent distance estimates for quantifying systematic uncertainties.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of stellar evolution is driven by one-dimensional (1D) simulations. 1D models, however, are severely limited by uncertainties on the exact behaviour of many multi-dimensional phenomena occurring inside stars, affecting their structure and evolution. Recent advances in computing resources have allowed small sections of a star to be reproduced with multi-D hydrodynamic models, with an unprecedented degree of detail and realism. In this work, we present a set of 3D simulations of a convective neon-burning shell in a 20 M$_\odot$ star run for the first time continuously from its early development through to complete fuel exhaustion, using unaltered input conditions from a 321D-guided 1D stellar model. These simulations help answer some open questions in stellar physics. In particular, they show that convective regions do not grow indefinitely due to entrainment of fresh material, but fuel consumption prevails over entrainment, so when fuel is exhausted convection also starts decaying. Our results show convergence between the multi-D simulations and the new 321D-guided 1D model, concerning the amount of convective boundary mixing to include in stellar models. The size of the convective zones in a star strongly affects its structure and evolution, thus revising their modelling in 1D will have important implications for the life and fate of stars. This will thus affect theoretical predictions related to nucleosynthesis, supernova explosions and compact remnants.</p>

<p>SNe Ia play a key role in the fields of astrophysics and cosmology. It is widely accepted that SNe Ia arise from thermonuclear explosions of WDs in binaries. However, there is no consensus on the fundamental aspects of the nature of SN Ia progenitors and their explosion mechanism. This fundamentally flaws our understanding of these important astrophysical objects. We outline the diversity of SNe Ia and the proposed progenitor models and explosion mechanisms. We discuss the recent theoretical and observational progress in addressing the SN Ia progenitor and explosion mechanism in terms of the observables at various stages of the explosion, including rates and delay times, pre-explosion companion stars, ejecta-companion interaction, early excess emission, early radio/X-ray emission from CSM interaction, surviving companions, late-time spectra and photometry, polarization signals, and SNR properties, etc. Despite the efforts from both the theoretical and observational side, the questions of how the WDs reach an explosive state and what progenitor systems are more likely to produce SNe Ia remain open. No single published model is able to consistently explain all observational features and the full diversity of SNe Ia. This may indicate that either a new progenitor paradigm or the improvement of current models is needed if all SNe Ia arise from the same origin. An alternative scenario is that different progenitor channels and explosion mechanisms contribute to SNe Ia. In the next decade, the ongoing campaigns with the JWST, Gaia and the ZTF, and upcoming extensive projects with the LSST and the SKA will allow us to conduct not only studies of individual SNe Ia in unprecedented detail but also systematic investigations for different subclasses of SNe Ia. This will advance theory and observations of SNe Ia sufficiently far to gain a deeper understanding of their origin and explosion mechanism.</p>
