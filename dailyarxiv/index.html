<p>2024-09-30, <strong>Octant Ambiguity in the Presence of Non-isotropic Lorentz Invariance Violation</strong>, Saurabh Shukla et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20439v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.20439v1</a></p>

<p>Global analyses of neutrino data suggest that the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ is likely to be nonmaximal with two closely matched solutions emerging: one representing a smaller angle ($\theta_{23}$ &lt; $\pi/4$) and the other a larger angle ($\theta_{23}$ &gt; $\pi/4$). This ambiguity, known as the octant ambiguity of $\theta_{23}$, presents a significant challenge in neutrino research and is a primary objective of future long-baseline experiments. In this study, for the first time, we explore how non-isotropic Lorentz violation affects measurements of mixing angle $\theta_{23}$, with a particular emphasis on sidereal effects in the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment. Our findings reveal that ability of DUNE to resolve the octant ambiguity is significantly compromised in the presence of the $c^{xy}_{e \tau}$ parameter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LIV exacerbates the degeneracy between the Dirac CP-phase $\delta_{cp}$ and $\theta_{23}$.</p>

<p>2024-09-30, <strong>Measuring the atmospheric muon neutrino and anti-neutrino flux ratio with the ATLAS detector at LHC</strong>, Deep Ghosh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20231v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.20231v1</a></p>

<p>There is a significant uncertainty in the prediction of atmospheric muon neutrino and anti-neutrino flux ratio using different flux models, especially at higher energies. We study the prospects of experimentally measuring this flux ratio as a function of energy with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. To this end, we compute the contained-vertex and external upward going charged current event rates induced by atmospheric muon (anti-)neutrinos through deep inelastic scattering at the 4 kiloton hadron calorimeter (HCAL) component of ATLAS. We illustrate the event selection criteria necessary to eliminate the cosmic ray muon background for the above event classes. While the contained vertex events have a striking topology with a muon being created inside the HCAL and then travelling to the muon chamber possibly through the tracker, for muons with energy larger than 3 GeV, a much higher statistics is obtained for the external upward going events created in the rock column below the detector. Our estimates show that the energy dependence of the ratio of negative and positively charged muons induced by atmospheric muon neutrino and anti-neutrino fluxes can be measured by ATLAS upto a muon energy of 100 GeV, with 1000-live days of neutrino physics exposure over a period of several years, considering only the period with the LHC beams not in circulation, but the detector and magnetic fields of ATLAS in operation. With this exposure, we obtain $63~\mu^-$ and $32~\mu^+$ contained vertex events, and $630~\mu^-$ and $307~\mu^+$ external upward-going events, after imposing the necessary selection criteria.</p>

<p>2024-09-30, <strong>Phase-Space methods for neutrino oscillations: extension to multi-beams</strong>, Denis Lacroix et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20215v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.20215v1</a></p>

<p>The Phase-Space approach (PSA), which was originally introduced in [Lacroix et al., Phys. Rev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino flavor oscillations for interacting neutrinos emitted from stellar objects is extended to describe arbitrary numbers of neutrino beams. The PSA is based on mapping the quantum fluctuations into a statistical treatment by sampling initial conditions followed by independent mean-field evolution. A new method is proposed to perform this sampling that allows treating an arbitrary number of neutrinos in each neutrino beam. We validate the technique successfully and confirm its predictive power on several examples where a reference exact calculation is possible. We show that it can describe many-body effects, such as entanglement and dissipation induced by the interaction between neutrinos. Due to the complexity of the problem, exact solutions can only be calculated for rather limited cases, with a limited number of beams and/or neutrinos in each beam. The PSA approach considerably reduces the numerical cost and provides an efficient technique to accurately simulate arbitrary numbers of beams. Examples of PSA results are given here, including up to 200 beams with time-independent or time-dependent Hamiltonian. We anticipate that this approach will be useful to bridge exact microscopic techniques with more traditional transport theories used in neutrino oscillations. It will also provide important reference calculations for future quantum computer applications where other techniques are not applicable to classical computers.</p>

<p>2024-09-30, <strong>50 years of Neutrino Physics at Aligarh Muslim University</strong>, S. K. Singh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20112v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.20112v1</a></p>

<p>An overview of the significant contributions made by the Aligarh group in the field of neutrino physics has been provided. The groupâs work began with the study of quasielastic neutrino scattering on deuterium, specifically the process $\nu_\mu + d \rightarrow \mu^- + p +p$, focusing on moderate neutrino energies within the impulse approximation framework in order to analyze the early experiments at ANL and BNL with deuterium filled bubble chambers. These studies were later extended to numerically calculate (anti)neutrino interaction cross sections for the inclusive quasielastic scattering from nuclei using local density approximation~(LDA), incorporating nucleon-nucleon correlations for moderate to heavy nuclear targets. The inelastic scattering cross sections for one pion production and the deep inelastic scattering~(DIS) from nuclei have been obtained using LDA with multi nucleon correlation effects. In the case of single pion production, the final state interaction of the pions with the residual nucleus has also been taken into account. In addition, the group has explored other inelastic processes of kaon and eta meson production, in the (anti)neutrino interactions with the nucleon targets. Furthermore, we have investigated electron and positron scattering off proton targets in the intermediate energy range, focusing on polarization observables and T-noninvariance. Our research has also delved into polarized electron scattering to explore the possibility of observing parity-violating asymmetry (PVA) in elastic and deep inelastic scattering, among other related topics. The group has also contributed to the study of atmospheric neutrino flux in the cosmic ray interactions, relevant for various sites of the neutrino oscillation experiments with atmospheric neutrinos.</p>

<p>2024-09-30, <strong>A search for the ultra high energy neutrinos with the low threshold phased array trigger system of the Askaryan Radio Array</strong>, Paramita Dasgupta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19847v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.19847v1</a></p>

<p>The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an in-ice ultra high energy (UHE, $&gt;10$ PeV) neutrino experiment at the South Pole that aims to detect UHE neutrino-induced radio emission in ice. ARA consists of five independent stations each consisting of a cubical lattice of in-ice antenna clusters with a side length of $\sim$10 m buried at $\sim$200 m below the ice surface. The fifth station of ARA (A5) is special as this station has an additional central string, the phased array (PA), which provides an interferometric trigger that enables ARA to trigger on weak signals that are otherwise buried in noise. Leveraging the low threshold phased array trigger, ARA was the first radio neutrino experiment to demonstrate significant improvement in sensitivity to weak signals. In this contribution, we present initial results from a neutrino search combining information from both the traditional station antennas and the phased array antennas of the A5 station. We show the improved vertex reconstruction achieved with this approach, and leveraging this improvement, we expect to enhance the analysis efficiency beyond what has been achieved previously by ARA. This analysis is the paradigmatic representation of future neutrino searches with the next generation of in-ice neutrino experiments.</p>

<p>2024-09-30, <strong>Quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild-like black hole surrounded by the pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo</strong>, Yanqiang Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20333v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.20333v1</a></p>

<p>The merger of binary black holes produces a series of decaying oscillations, during which energy is radiated in gravitational waves. The characteristic signal in the ringdown phase can be described by quasinormal modes (QNMs). In this paper, we investigate the QNMs resulting from scalar field perturbations of black holes surrounded by pseudo-isothermal dark matter halos. The complex frequencies of these QNMs are numerically computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation. Additionally, the time evolution of the scalar perturbations is examined using the finite difference method, considering various multipole numbers and dark matter halo parameters. For a static, spherically symmetric black hole, the photon sphereâcomposed of circular null geodesicsâplays a crucial role in analyzing the black hole shadow. Furthermore, the connection between the black hole shadow and QNMs is explored in the eikonal limit.</p>

<p>2024-09-30, <strong>The search for light dark matter with DAMIC-M</strong>, R. Smida et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20290v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.20290v1</a></p>

<p>The DAMIC-M (DArk Matter In CCDs at Modane) experiment will use skipper CCDs to search for low mass (sub-GeV) dark matter underground at the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM) in France. With about 1 kg of silicon target mass and sub-electron energy resolution, the detector will surpass the exposure and threshold (eV-scale) of previous experiments. Thus, DAMIC-M will have world-leading sensitivity to a variety of âhidden sectorâ candidates. In this talk, we will report on science results from a prototype detector, test performance of CCD modules, and the status of the detector construction at LSM.</p>

<p>2024-09-30, <strong>Vortex Lines in Ultralight Bosonic Dark Matter around Rotating Supermassive Black Holes</strong>, K. Korshynska et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20236v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.20236v1</a></p>

<p>Theoretical analysis of the interaction between superfluid dark matter and rotating supermassive black holes offers a promising framework for probing quantum effects in ultralight dark matter and its role in galactic structure. We study how black hole rotation influences the state of ultralight bosonic dark matter, focusing on the stability and dynamics of vortex lines. The gravitational effects of both dark matter and the black hole on the physical properties of these vortex lines, including their precession around the black hole, are analyzed.</p>

<p>2024-09-30, <strong>The axion dark matter experiment MADMAX</strong>, Pascal Pralavorio et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20169v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.20169v1</a></p>

<p>The MAgnetized Disk and Mirror Axion eXperiment (MADMAX) is a future experiment aiming to detect dark matter axions from the galactic halo by resonant conversion to photons in a strong magnetic field. It uses a stack of dielectric disks in front of a mirror, called booster, to enhance the potential signal from axion-photon conversion over a significant mass range. Several small scale prototype systems have been developed and tested to verify the experimental principles. The current status of the experiment and its prototypes, including the ongoing research and development and remaining challenges, are presented in this contribution.</p>

<p>2024-09-30, <strong>Search for dark photons in heavy-ion collisions</strong>, Adrian William Romero Jorge et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20141v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.20141v1</a></p>

<p>The vector $U$-bosons, or so called âdark photonsâ, are one of the possible candidates for the dark matter mediators. We present a procedure to derive theoretical constraints on the upper limit of kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon^2(M_U)$ from heavy-ion as well as $p+p$ and $p+A$ dilepton data from SIS to LHC energies. Our study is based on the microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach which reproduces the measured dilepton spectra in $p+p$, $p+A$ and $A+A$ collisions well. In addition to the different dilepton channels originating from interactions and decays of ordinary Standard Model matter particles (mesons and baryons), we incorporate in the PHSD the decay of hypothetical $U$-bosons to dileptons, $U \to e^+ e^-$, where the $U$-bosons themselves are produced by the Dalitz decay of pions, $\eta$-mesons, Delta resonances as well as by vector meson and $K^+$ decays. This analysis provides the upper limit on the $\epsilon^2(M_U)$ and can also help to estimate the requested accuracy for future experimental searches of âlightâ dark photons by dilepton experiments.</p>

<p>2024-09-30, <strong>Top quark flavor changing neutral currents at Future Linear Colliders</strong>, Adil Jueid et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20115v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.20115v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the production and the decay of top quark through flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) interaction at future linear colliders. We first discuss the theoretical predictions of top quark FCNC decays into $qH$ and $qZ$ within a class of $t$-channel simplified dark matter models. For the existing bounds on the top quark FCNC interactions at the Large Hadron Collider, we estimate the production rates of top quark through FCNC interactions at future linear colliders for energies from $250$ GeV to $3$ TeV.</p>

<p>2024-09-30, <strong>Finite velocity effect of ultralight vector dark matter in pulsar timing arrays</strong>, Qing-Hua Zhu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20017v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.20017v1</a></p>

<p>Pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have recently reported evidence of stochastic gravitational waves. Besides gravitational wave signals from cosmological or astrophysical origins, PTAs are also capable of detecting coherently oscillating ultralight dark matter in our galaxy. This paper investigates pulsar timing influenced by ultralight vector dark matter, based on the pure gravitational effect of the vector field. We extensively consider the finite dark matter velocity $v$ for ultralight vector dark matter in PTAs, rather than the limit $v\rightarrow0$ in previous studies. It is found that the leading-order shift in pulsar timing turns out to be proportional to negative slope of $v$. Consequently, one can not distinguish between ultralight vector dark matter and ultralight scalar dark matter with the timing residual amplitude. Assuming the existence of stochastic vector dark matter in our galaxy, the corresponding angular correlation curve in PTAs is found to be similar to that of scalar dark matter. We find that it can be distinguishable, only when the pulsar pairs are distant from the earth.</p>

<p>2024-09-30, <strong>MAGICS II. Seed black holes stripped of their surrounding stars do not sink</strong>, Yihao Zhou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19914v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.19914v1</a></p>

<p>MBH seed mergers are expected to be among the loudest sources of gravitational waves detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), providing a unique window into the birth and early growth of SMBH. We present the MAGICS-II simulation suite, consisting of 6 galaxy mergers that result in MBH seeds mergers identified in the cosmological simulation ASTRID. With the enhanced resolution (mass resolution: 500 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$; softening length: $5$ pc), improved subgrid models for the MBH dynamics and accretion, and the accurate regularized gravity integrator included in KETJU, we trace MBH seeds dynamics down to 0.1 pc. After evolving all the systems for $\approx$ 1.2 Gyr in three stages (MAGICS-2000, MAGICS-500, and MAGICS-K), we find in 4 of the 6 systems the MBHs stall at separations $ \Delta r \gtrsim 200$ pc. Only in 2 systems, the MBHs manage to sink further, and only in one of them a bound binary forms. In the sinking systems, the MBH retains a population of bound stars. The final separation between the MBH is related to the surrounding unstripped stellar (and/or dark matter) mass: if more than 90\% of the surrounding stellar system is stripped away, the MBHs stall. Besides the unstripped stars from the original host galaxy, we find that newly formed stars bound to the MBH significantly contribute to its sinking. Resolving the stellar system around MBH seeds, and its induced tidal interactions and dynamical friction is key for accurately capturing MBH dynamics. For this, high resolution simulations are required. In a companion paper (MAGICS-III), we resimulate the central regions of these systems with increased resolution to model directly the effects of actual star clusters around MBHs.</p>

<p>2024-09-30, <strong>Detection of [OIII]88$Î¼$m in JADES-GS-z14-0 at z=14.1793</strong>, Sander Schouws et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20549v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.20549v1</a></p>

<p>We report the first successful ALMA follow-up observations of a secure $z &gt; 10$ JWST-selected galaxy, by robustly detecting ($6.6\sigma$) the [OIII]$_{88\mu m}\,$ line in JADES-GS-z14-0 (hereafter GS-z14). The ALMA detection yields a spectroscopic redshift of $z=14.1793\pm0.0007$, and increases the precision on the prior redshift measurement of $z=14.32_{-0.20}^{+0.08}$ from NIRSpec by $\gtrsim$180$\times$. Moreover, the redshift is consistent with that previously determined from a tentative detection ($3.6\sigma$) of CIII]$_{1907,1909}$ ($z=14.178\pm0.013$), solidifying the redshift determination via multiple line detections. We measure a line luminosity of $L_\mathrm{[OIII]88} = (2.1 \pm 0.5)\times10^8\,L_\odot$, placing GS-z14 at the lower end, but within the scatter of, the local $L_\mathrm{[OIII]88}$-star formation rate relation. No dust continuum from GS-z14 is detected, suggesting an upper limit on the dust-to-stellar mass ratio of $&lt; 2 \times 10^{-3}$, consistent with dust production from supernovae with a yield $y_d &lt; 0.3\,M_\odot$. Combining a previous JWST/MIRI photometric measurement of the [OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007$\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$ and H$\beta$ lines with Cloudy models, we find GS-z14 to be surprisingly metal-enriched ($Z\sim0.05 - 0.2\,Z_\odot$) a mere $300\,\mathrm{Myr}$ after the Big Bang. The detection of a bright oxygen line in GS-z14 thus reinforces the notion that galaxies in the early Universe undergo rapid evolution.</p>

<p>High-energy (HE) and very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations from the Galactic center (GC) detected extended emission correlated with the morphology of the central molecular zone (CMZ). Emission in both bands is expected to be produced by hadronic interaction between cosmic rays (CRs) and ambient gas. We examine if our three previously proposed scenarios for the CR sources and dynamics, which are consistent with the VHE gamma-ray data (1-100 TeV), also match the HE gamma-ray observations (10-300 GeV). Additionally, we analyze the effect of the isotropic Galactic CR âseaâ inside the CMZ. We generated synthetic gamma-ray maps considering a simplified isotropic diffusion, but more realistic dynamics with two diffusion zones (in and out of the CMZ) and polar advection, for mono-energetic particles of 3 TeV. Additionally, we considered two gas distributions for the CMZ (with and without an inner cavity), and CR populations injected from the clusters of young massive stars (the Arches Cluster, the Quintuplet Cluster, and the nuclear star cluster), plus the supernova Sgr A East. Only the combination of more realistic CR dynamics, the CMZ with an inner cavity, CR injection from all proposed sources, and a CR sea similar to that observed in the Solar System reproduced the current HE and VHE gamma-ray detection from the CMZ and was consistent with the observed gamma-rays from Sagittarius A*. The HE and VHE gamma-rays observations of the GC can be reproduced by a unified model for the CRs.}</p>
