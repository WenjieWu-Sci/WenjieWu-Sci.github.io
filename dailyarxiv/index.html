<p>2024-07-25, <strong>One-point Statistics in various cosmic environments in the presence of massive neutrinos</strong>, Mohadese Khoshtinat et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18233v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.18233v1</a></p>

<p>Studying the structures (halos and galaxies) within the cosmic environments (void, sheet, filament, and node) where they reside is an ongoing attempt in cosmological studies. The link between the properties of structures and the cosmic environments may help to unravel the nature of the dark sector of the Universe. In this paper, we study the cosmic web environments from the spatial pattern perspective in the context of $ \Lambda $CDM and $ \nu \Lambda $CDM as an example of an extension to the vanilla model. To do this, we use the T-web classification method and classify the cosmic environments for the catalogues from the gevolution N-body simulations for $ \Lambda $CDM and $ \nu \Lambda $CDM cosmology. Then, we compute the first nearest neighbour cumulative distribution function, spherical contact cumulative distribution function, and $ J$-function for every cosmic environment. In the context of the standard model, the results indicate that these functions can differentiate the various cosmic environments. In association with distinguishing between extensions of the standard model of cosmologies, these functions within the cosmic environment seem beneficial as a complementary probe.</p>

<p>2024-07-25, <strong>Confronting a Standard Model extension with a dark $U(1)$ gauge sector with the prediction for the W-boson mass</strong>, Stefan Dittmaier et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18211v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.18211v1</a></p>

<p>The Dark Abelian Sector Model (DASM) is an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics with an additional spontaneously broken $U_\text{d}(1)$ gauge symmetry connected to a dark sector, i.e. the SM particles do not carry the corresponding charge. In addition to the gauge boson resulting from the extra $U_\text{d}(1)$ gauge symmetry, the particle content is extended by a further Higgs boson, one Dirac fermion as well as right-handed neutrinos. Employing the $U_Y(1)$ field-strength tensor as well as the SM Higgs mass operator (the only two singlet operators of the SM with dimension less than four) and the right-handed neutrino fields, we open three portals to the dark sector.   After an introduction of the model, we discuss a renormalization scheme for the complete model with a special focus on the renormalization of the mixing angles. Finally, as an example of application, we present the prediction for the W-boson mass derived from muon decay in the DASM.</p>

<p>2024-07-25, <strong>Unlocking Discovery Potential for Decaying Dark Matter and Faint X-ray Sources with XRISM</strong>, Yu Zhou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18189v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.18189v1</a></p>

<p>Astrophysical emission lines arising from particle decays can offer unique insights into the nature of dark matter (DM). Using dedicated simulations with background and foreground modeling, we comprehensively demonstrate that the recently launched XRISM space telescope with powerful X-ray spectroscopy capabilities is particularly well-suited to probe decaying DM, such as sterile neutrinos and axion-like particles, in the mass range of few to tens of keV. We analyze and map XRISM’s DM discovery potential parameter space by considering Milky Way Galactic DM halo, including establishing an optimal line-of-sight search, as well as dwarf galaxies where we identify Segue 1 as a remarkably promising target. We demonstrate that with only 100 ks exposure XRISM/Resolve instrument is capable of probing the underexplored DM parameter window around few keV and testing DM couplings with sensitivity that exceeds by two orders existing Segue 1 limits. Further, we demonstrate that XRISM/Xtend instrument sensitivity enables discovery of the nature of faint astrophysical X-ray sources, especially in Segue 1, which could shed light on star-formation history. We discuss implications for decaying DM searches with improved detector energy resolution in future experiments.</p>

<p>2024-07-25, <strong>A bound on thermal y-distortion of the cosmic neutrino background</strong>, Gabriela Barenboim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18102v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.18102v1</a></p>

<p>We consider the possibility that the cosmic neutrino background might have a nonthermal spectrum, and investigate its effect on cosmological parameters relative to standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology. As a specific model, we consider a thermal $y$-distortion, which alters the distribution function of the neutrino background by depleting the population of low-energy neutrinos and enhancing the high-energy tail. We constrain the thermal $y$-parameter of the cosmic neutrino background using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and place a $95\%$-confidence upper bound of $y \leq 0.043$. The $y$-parameter increases the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom, reducing the sound horizon radius and increasing the best-fit value for the Hubble constant $H_0$. We obtain an upper bound on the Hubble constant of $H_0 = 71.12\ \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ at $95\%$ confidence, substantially reducing the tension between CMB/BAO constraints and direct measurement of the expansion rate from Type-Ia supernovae. Including a spectral distortion also allows for a higher value of the spectral index of scalar fluctuations, with a best-fit of $n_{\mathrm{S}} = 0.9720 \pm 0.0063$, and a $95\%$-confidence upper bound of $n_{\mathrm{S}} \leq 0.9842$.</p>

<p>2024-07-25, <strong>Neutrino cosmology after DESI: tightest mass upper limits, preference for the normal ordering, and tension with terrestrial observations</strong>, Jun-Qian Jiang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18047v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.18047v1</a></p>

<p>The recent DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements have led to tight upper limits on the neutrino mass sum, potentially in tension with oscillation constraints requiring $\sum m_{\nu} \gtrsim 0.06\,{\text{eV}}$. Under the physically motivated assumption of positive $\sum m_{\nu}$, we study the extent to which these limits are tightened by adding other available cosmological probes, and robustly quantify the preference for the normal mass ordering over the inverted one, as well as the tension between cosmological and terrestrial data. Combining DESI data with Cosmic Microwave Background measurements and several late-time background probes, the tightest $2\sigma$ limit we find without including a local $H_0$ prior is $\sum m_{\nu}&lt;0.05\,{\text{eV}}$. This leads to a strong preference for the normal ordering, with Bayes factor relative to the inverted one of $46.5$. Depending on the dataset combination and tension metric adopted, we quantify the tension between cosmological and terrestrial observations as ranging between $2.5\sigma$ and $5\sigma$. These results are strenghtened when allowing for a time-varying dark energy component with equation of state lying in the physically motivated non-phantom regime, $w(z) \geq -1$, highlighting an interesting synergy between the nature of dark energy and laboratory probes of the mass ordering. If these tensions persist and cannot be attributed to systematics, either or both standard neutrino (particle) physics or the underlying cosmological model will have to be questioned.</p>

<p>2024-07-25, <strong>From 100 kpc to 10 Gpc: Dark Matter self-interactions before and after DESI</strong>, Salvatore Bottaro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18252v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.18252v1</a></p>

<p>We consider Dark Matter self-interactions mediated by ultralight scalars. We show that effectively massless mediators lead to an enhancement of the matter power spectrum, while heavier mediators lead to a suppression, together with a feature around their Jeans scale. We derive the strongest present constraints by combining Planck and BOSS data. The recent DESI measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations exhibit a mild preference for long-range self-interactions, as strong as 4 per mille of the gravitational coupling. Forthcoming data from DESI itself and Euclid will confirm or disprove such a hint.</p>

<p>2024-07-25, <strong>Probing the early universe with future GW observatories</strong>, Suvashis Maity et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18246v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.18246v1</a></p>

<p>One of the fundamental characteristics of slow roll inflation is its generation of tensor perturbations, which manifest as stochastic gravitational waves (GWs). Slow roll inflation results in a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum that maintains its scale invariance as it transitions into the radiation-dominated era. However, introducing an intermediate reheating phase can modify the spectral tilt, depending on the equation of state governing that particular epoch. These GWs, especially on smaller scales, are anticipated to be observable by forthcoming GW detectors. In this study, we initially delineate the parameter space encompassing the inflationary energy scale, reheating temperature, and equation of state in a model-independent manner, focusing on the spectra detectable by GW detectors such as LISA, ET, DECIGO, and BBO. We also examine the implications for the $\alpha$-attractor model of inflation and explore the observational constraints on $n_s-r$ prediction in the light of GW detection. Then, we point out the probable ranges for various non-gravitational and gravitational coupling between the inflaton and Standard Model particles considering the perturbative reheating. If one assumes PBHs were formed during the early reheating era, such detection of GW signal also sheds light on the probing PBH parameters. Note that for the case of PBH domination, we also consider the contribution of the induced GW due to the density function in PBH distribution, which helps to decode the phase of early PBH domination. Finally, to test the production of other cosmological relics through future GW missions, we consider dark matter produced via gravitational interaction in the early universe.</p>

<p>2024-07-25, <strong>Testing non-local gravity through Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies kinematics</strong>, Filippo Bouchè et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18084v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.18084v1</a></p>

<p>The emergence of the Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies in recent years has posed a severe challenge to the galaxy formation models as well as the Extended Theories of Gravity. The existence of both dark matter lacking and dark matter dominated systems within the same family of astrophysical objects indeed requires the gravity models to be versatile enough to describe very different gravitational regimes. In this work, we study a non-local extension of the theory of General Relativity that has drawn increasing attention in recent years due to its capability to account for the late time cosmic acceleration without introducing any dark energy fluid. We leverage the kinematic data of three Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies: NGC 1052-DF2 and NGC 1052-DF4, which are dark matter lacking, and Dragonfly 44, which exhibits a highly dominant dark matter component. Our analysis shows that the non-local corrections to the Newtonian potential do not affect the kinematic predictions, hence no spoiling effects emerge when the Non-local Gravity model serves as a dark energy model. We additionally provide the minimum value that the characteristic non-local radii can reach at these mass scales.</p>

<p>2024-07-25, <strong>Intergalactic-Absorption Confounding Circumgalactic Observations</strong>, Itai Bromberg et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18071v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.18071v1</a></p>

<p>The origin of warm ions in the circum-galactic medium (CGM) surrounding massive galaxies remains a mystery. In this paper, we argue that a significant fraction of the observed warm-ion columns may arise in the intergalactic medium (IGM) surrounding galactic halos. We use a simple spherical collapse model of the dark matter (DM) halos and their baryonic content to compute the evolving ion fractions within and outside virial halos. We show that the photoionized IGM may produce a thick blanket of warm ions around the CGM, thereby contaminating CGM observations. We find that the IGM contributes $&gt; 75\%$ of the total \ion{O}{6} column densities in halos with virial masses exceeding a few times $10^{11}~M_\odot$, and that it may dominate the \ion{O}{6} absorption even for lower mass-halos, depending on the impact parameter. We compare our results with observations and find that our simplified model reproduces the overall \ion{O}{6} columns as well as their trend with the impact parameter and halo mass. We show that observed warm ion columns may be completely dominated by the IGM envelopes, consistent with CGM$^2$ data. We, therefore, suggest that theoretical interpretations of CGM-survey observations must consider the possible contribution of the surrounding IGM. Although our simplified model suggests that it may be possible to kinematically distinguish between CGM and IGM origins through the absorption line profiles, this distinction is likely unfeasible in realistic astrophysical halos, due to the complex velocity structure in the multi-phased CGM.</p>

<p>2024-07-25, <strong>The DAMIC-M Low Background Chamber</strong>, I. Arnquist et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17872v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.17872v1</a></p>

<p>The DArk Matter In CCDs at Modane (DAMIC-M) experiment is designed to search for light dark matter (m$_{\chi}$&lt;10\,GeV/c$^2$) at the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM) in France. DAMIC-M will use skipper charge-coupled devices (CCDs) as a kg-scale active detector target. Its single-electron resolution will enable eV-scale energy thresholds and thus world-leading sensitivity to a range of hidden sector dark matter candidates. A DAMIC-M prototype, the Low Background Chamber (LBC), has been taking data at LSM since 2022. The LBC provides a low-background environment, which has been used to characterize skipper CCDs, study dark current, and measure radiopurity of materials planned for DAMIC-M. It also allows testing of various subsystems like readout electronics, data acquisition software, and slow control. This paper describes the technical design and performance of the LBC.</p>

<p>2024-07-25, <strong>Tracing the evolution of the cool gas in CGM and IGM environments through Mg II absorption from redshift z=0.75 to z=1.65 using DESI-Y1 data</strong>, X. Wu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17809v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.17809v1</a></p>

<p>We present a measurement of the mean absorption of cool gas traced by Mg II (${\lambda\lambda 2796, 2803}$) around emission line galaxies (ELGs), spanning spatial scales from 20 kpc to 10 Mpc. The measurement is based on cross-matching the positions of about 2.5 million ELGs at $z = 0.75-1.65$ and the metal absorption in the spectra of 1.4 million background quasars with data provided by the Year 1 sample of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The ELGs are divided into two redshift intervals: $0.75 &lt; z &lt; 1.0$ and $1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.65$. We find that the composite spectra constructed by stacking the ELG-QSO pairs show evolution with redshift, with $z&gt;1$ having a systematically higher signal of Mg II absorption. Within 1 Mpc, the covering fraction of the cool gas at $z &gt; 1$ is higher than that of $z &lt; 1$. The enhancement becomes less apparent especially if the projected distance $r_{p}&gt;$1 Mpc. Also, ELGs with higher stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) yield higher clustering of Mg II absorbers at $z&lt;1$. For $z&gt;1$, the covering fractions with different SFRs show little difference. The higher Mg II absorption at higher redshift also supports the observations of higher star formation at cosmic noon. Besides, the profile of Mg II absorption reveals a change of slope on scales of about 1 Mpc, consistent with the expected transition from a dark matter halo-dominated environment to a regime where clustering is dominated by halo-halo correlations. We estimate the cool gas density profile and derive the metal abundance at different redshifts. The growth of metal abundance suggests an increased presence of cool gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM) towards higher redshifts.</p>

<p>2024-07-25, <strong>Observational Evidence for Magnetic Field Amplification in SN 1006</strong>, Moeri Tao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17739v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.17739v1</a></p>

<p>We report the first observational evidence for magnetic field amplification in the north-east/south-west (NE/SW) shells of supernova remnant SN 1006, one of the most promising sites of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration. In previous studies, the strength of magnetic fields in these shells was estimated to be $B_{\rm SED}$ $\simeq$ 25$\mu$G from the spectral energy distribution, where the synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accounted for radio to X-rays, along with the inverse Compton emission extending from the GeV to TeV energy bands. However, the analysis of broadband radio data, ranging from 1.37~GHz to 100~GHz, indicated that the radio spectrum steepened from $\alpha_1 = 0.52 \pm 0.02$ to $\alpha_2 = 1.34 \pm 0.21$ by $\Delta \alpha$ = 0.85 $\pm$ 0.21. This is naturally interpreted as a cooling break under strong magnetic field of $B_{\rm brk}$ $\ge$ 2~mG. Moreover, the high-resolution MeerKAT image indicated that the width of the radio NE/SW shells was broader than that of the X-ray shell by a factor of only 3$-$20, as measured by Chandra. Such narrow radio shells can be naturally explained if the magnetic field responsible for the radio emissions is $B_{\rm R}$ $\ge$ 2 mG. Assuming that the magnetic field is locally enhanced by a factor of approximately $a$ = 100 along the NE/SW shells, we argue that the filling factor, which is the volume ratio of such a magnetically enhanced region to that of the entire shell, must be as low as approximately $k$ = 2.5$\times$10$^{-5}$.</p>
