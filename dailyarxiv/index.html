<p>2024-07-31, <strong>Final state interactions for high energy scattering off atomic electrons</strong>, Ryan Plestid et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21752v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21752v1</a></p>

<p>We consider the scattering of high energy leptons off bound atomic electrons focusing primarily on final state interactions i.e., the exchange of virtual photons between the outgoing energetic electron, and the heavy residual charged “debris” in the final state. These effects are inherently absent from calculations for a free electron at rest. Coulomb exchanges are enhanced by the large number of electrons in the atomic debris, and are unsuppressed by non-relativistic velocities in the debris. We find that these exchanges can be resummed using operator methods, and cancel at the level of the cross section until at least $O(\alpha^3)$. Furthermore, we argue that both final {\it and} initial state Coulomb exchanges (enhanced by the number of electrons in the atom) do not affect the cross section until at least $O(\alpha^3)$. Transverse photon couplings to non relativistic electrons are proportional to their small velocities, and rotational invariance suppresses their contribution to $O(\alpha^3)$. Our results are relevant for precision experiments involving neutrinos, electrons, positrons, and muons scattering off of atomic electrons in a fixed target.</p>

<p>2024-07-31, <strong>Exploring atmospheric neutrino oscillations at ESSnuSB</strong>, ESSnuSB et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21663v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21663v1</a></p>

<p>This study provides an analysis of atmospheric neutrino oscillations at the ESSnuSB far detector facility. The prospects of the two cylindrical Water Cherenkov detectors with a total fiducial mass of 540 kt are investigated over 10 years of data taking in the standard three-flavor oscillation scenario. We present the confidence intervals for the determination of mass ordering, $\theta_{23}$ octant as well as for the precisions on $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ and $|\Delta m_{31}^2|$. It is shown that mass ordering can be resolved by $3\sigma$ CL ($5\sigma$ CL) after 4 years (10 years) regardless of the true neutrino mass ordering. Correspondingly, the wrong $\theta_{23}$ octant could be excluded by $3\sigma$ CL after 4 years (7 years) in the case where the true neutrino mass ordering is normal ordering (inverted ordering). The results presented in this work are complementary to the accelerator neutrino program in the ESSnuSB project.</p>

<p>2024-07-31, <strong>Neutrino and antineutrino charged-current multi-nucleon cross sections revisited</strong>, J. E. Sobczyk et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21587v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21587v1</a></p>

<p>In this work we improve on several aspects of the computation of the (anti-)neutrino charged-current multi-nucleon cross section carried out in Phys.Rev.C 83 (2011) 045501 and Phys.Rev.C 102 (2020) 024601. Most importantly, we implement a consistent treatment of the nucleon self-energy in the $W^\pm N\to N’\pi$ amplitude entering the definition of the two-particle two-hole (2p2h) cross-section, and estimate the source of uncertainty of our model due to a simplified treatment of the $\Delta$ self-energy. Our new predictions are around $20-40\%$ higher than previously. We show comparisons for the inclusive lepton double-differential cross sections, with no pions in the final state, measured by MiniBooNE on carbon and by T2K on carbon and oxygen. In all cases, we find an excellent reproduction of the experiments, and in particular, the neutrino MiniBooNE data is now well described without requiring a global $90\%$ re-scaling of the flux. In addition, we take the opportunity of this revision to discuss in detail several important issues of the calculation of the 2p2h cross section, delving into the microscopic dynamics of the multi-nucleon mechanisms. The improved treatment presented in this work provides realistic first-step emitted two-nucleon final state momentum configurations, beyond the approximation of phase-space distributions.</p>

<p>2024-07-31, <strong>First measurement of the triaxiality of the inner dark matter halo of the Milky Way</strong>, Hanneke C. Woudenberg et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21790v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21790v1</a></p>

<p>Stellar streams are particularly sensitive probes of the mass distribution of galaxies. In this work, we focus on the Helmi Streams, the remnants of an accreted dwarf galaxy orbiting the inner Milky Way. We examine in depth their peculiar dynamical properties, and use these to provide tight constraints on the Galactic potential, and specifically on its dark matter halo in the inner 20 kpc. We extract 6D phase-space information for the Helmi Streams from Gaia DR3, and confirm that the Streams split up into two clumps in angular momentum space, and that these depict different degrees of phase-mixing. To explain these characteristics we explore a range of Galactic potential models with a triaxial NFW halo, further constrained by rotation curve data. We find that a Galactic potential with a mildly triaxial dark matter halo, having $p=1.013^{+0.006}_{-0.006}$, $q=1.204^{+0.032}_{-0.036}$, $M_{\rm{discs}}=4.65^{+0.47}_{-0.57}\cdot10^{10} M_{\odot}$ and $M_{\rm{DM}}(&lt; 15 \text{kpc})=1.14^{+0.11}_{-0.10}\cdot10^{11} M_{\odot}$, is required to form two clumps in angular momentum space over time. Their formation is driven by the fact that the clumps are on different orbital families and close to an orbital resonance. This resonance also explains the different degrees of mixing observed, as well as the presence of a dynamically cold subclump (also known as S2). This first and very precise measurement of the triaxiality of the inner dark matter halo of the Galaxy uniquely reveals the high sensitivity of phase-mixed streams to the exact form of the gravitational potential.</p>

<p>2024-07-31, <strong>SQUIDs for detection of potential dark matter candidates</strong>, Siddarth Sivakumar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21689v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21689v1</a></p>

<p>Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) are extremely sensitive magnetic flux sensors which render them useful in a wide array of instrumentation. SQUIDs are often paired with other detectors as a readout mechanism to obtain quantitative insight. SQUIDs have impacted many fields but much less addressed is its impact on the field of fundamental physics, particularly in the search for dark matter. Dark matter is believed to make up around 27% of all mass-energy content of the universe and will provide critical insight into understanding large-scale structures of the universe. Axions and WIMPs are the prominent two dark matter candidates whose search has been fueled by the usage of SQUID read-outs.</p>

<p>2024-07-31, <strong>Brane-vector dark matter and its connection to inflation and primordial gravitational waves</strong>, Cao H. Nam et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21410v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21410v1</a></p>

<p>The scalar mode describing the fluctuation of the 3-brane (the observable universe) in a five-dimensional bulk spacetime compactified on a circle is absorbed by the Kaluza-Klein U(1) gauge field, leading to a massive brane-vector living on the 3-brane. The brane-vector can be responsible for dark matter because it is odd under a $\mathrm{Z}_2$ symmetry, neutral under the Standard Model (SM) symmetries, and couples extremely weak to the SM particles due to its gravitational origin. Interestingly, the brane-vector dark matter could leave particular imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the primordial gravitational waves. Hence, the precise measurements of the CMB and the observations of the primordial gravitational waves generated during the inflation can provide a potential way to probe the extra-dimensions and branes which are the main ingredients of string/M theory.</p>

<p>2024-07-31, <strong>Supermassive blackhole-Ultralight dark matter connection</strong>, T R Govindarajan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21355v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21355v1</a></p>

<p>A novel proposal linking the origin of supermassive blackhole formation and ultralight dark matter. Ultralight bosons of mass $10^{-22}-10^{-24}$ eV which is one of the front running proposal for dark matter could also linked with the formation and evolution of supermassive blackholes at the center of all the galaxies.</p>

<p>2024-07-31, <strong>Dark matter, leptogenesis and Z’ in the B-L model</strong>, XinXin Qi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21292v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21292v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the interplay between dark matter, leptogenesis and a new gauge boson $Z^\prime$ in the $B-L$ model. A fermion dark matter $\chi$ carrying $U(1)_{B-L}$ charge is introduced to the model but not coupling with other particles. We consider the freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms, and obtain the correct relic density respectively. We have scanned the feasible parameter space and found that the dark matter direct detection experiments imposed the most stringent constraints on the parameter space. The constraint on the parameter space places a limit on the mass of dark matter with $m_{\chi} \approx 1/2 M_{Z’}$ within a narrow region in the case of freeze-out scenario, and we can obtain the right baryon asymmetry result in the case of $m_{\chi}\subset[654$ GeV, 664 GeV]. For the freeze-in scenario, we have a much broader parameter space for $m_{\chi}$ and $M_{Z^\prime}$ but $g_{BL}$ is restricted at $10^{-5}$ level for $Q=0.1$. In both scenarios, $g_{BL}-M_{Z^\prime}$ is limited within a narrow region by the dark matter relic density, direct detection and baryon asymmetry constraints.</p>

<p>2024-07-31, <strong>Captured molecules could make a Bose star visible</strong>, V. V. Flambaum et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21262v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21262v1</a></p>

<p>A Bose star passing through cold molecular clouds may capture atoms, molecules and dust particles. The observational signature of such an event would be a relatively small amount of matter that is gravitationally bound. This binding may actually be provided by invisible dark matter forming the Bose star. We may expect a relative excess of heavier atoms, molecules, and solid dust compared to the content of giant cold molecular clouds since the velocity of heavy particles at a given temperature is lower and it may be small compared to the escape velocity, $v_\mathrm{rms} = \sqrt{3k_\mathrm{B} T/m_\mathrm{gas}} \ll v_\mathrm{esc}=\sqrt{2GM/R}$. Finally, the velocity of this captured matter cloud may correlate with the expected velocity of free dark matter particles (e.g. expected axion wind velocity relative to Earth).</p>

<p>2024-07-31, <strong>A study in scarlet – II. Spectroscopic properties of a sample of Intermediate Luminosity Red Transients</strong>, G. Valerin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21733v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21733v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the spectroscopic characteristics of Intermediate Luminosity Red Transients (ILRTs), a class of elusive objects with peak luminosity between that of classical novae and standard supernovae. We present the extensive optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic monitoring of four ILRTs, namely NGC 300 2008OT-1, AT 2019abn, AT 2019ahd and AT 2019udc. First we focus on the evolution of the most prominent spectral features observed in the low resolution spectra, then we discuss more in detail the high resolution spectrum collected for NGC 300 2008OT-1 with the Very Large Telescope equipped with UVES. Finally we analyse late time spectra of NGC 300 2008OT-1 and AT 2019ahd through comparisons with both synthetic and observed spectra. Balmer and Ca lines dominate the optical spectra, revealing the presence of slowly moving circumstellar medium (CSM) around the objects. The line luminosity of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Ca II NIR triplet presents a double peaked evolution with time, possibly indicative of interaction between fast ejecta and the slow CSM. The high resolution spectrum of NGC 300 2008OT-1 reveals a complex circumstellar environment, with the transient being surrounded by a slow ($\sim$30 km s$^{-1}$) progenitor wind. At late epochs, optical spectra of NGC 300 2008OT-1 and AT 2019ahd show broad ($\sim$2500 km s$^{-1}$) emission features at $\sim$6170 A and $\sim$7000 A which are unprecedented for ILRTs. We find that these lines originate most likely from the blending of several narrow lines, possibly of iron-peak elements.</p>

<p>2024-07-31, <strong>A study in scarlet – I. Photometric properties of a sample of Intermediate Luminosity Red Transients</strong>, G. Valerin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21671v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21671v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the photometric characteristics of a sample of Intermediate Luminosity Red Transients (ILRTs), a class of elusive objects with peak luminosity between that of classical novae and standard supernovae. We present the multi-wavelength photometric follow-up of four ILRTs, namely NGC 300 2008OT-1, AT 2019abn, AT 2019ahd and AT 2019udc. Through the analysis and modelling of their spectral energy distribution and bolometric light curves we infer the physical parameters associated with these transients. All four objects display a single peaked light curve which ends in a linear decline in magnitudes at late phases. A flux excess with respect to a single black body emission is detected in the infrared domain for three objects in our sample, a few months after maximum. This feature, commonly found in ILRTs, is interpreted as a sign of dust formation. Mid infrared monitoring of NGC 300 2008OT-1 761 days after maximum allows us to infer the presence of $\sim$10$^{-3}$-10$^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ of dust, depending on the chemical composition and the grain size adopted. The late time decline of the bolometric light curves of the considered ILRTs is shallower than expected for $^{56}$Ni decay, hence requiring an additional powering mechanism. James Webb Space Telescope observations of AT 2019abn prove that the object has faded below its progenitor luminosity in the mid-infrared domain, five years after its peak. Together with the disappearance of NGC 300 2008OT-1 in Spitzer images seven years after its discovery, this supports the terminal explosion scenario for ILRTs. With a simple semi-analytical model we try to reproduce the observed bolometric light curves in the context of few M$_{\odot}$ of material ejected at few 10$^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$ and enshrouded in an optically thick circumstellar medium.</p>
