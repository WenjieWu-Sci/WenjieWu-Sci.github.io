<p>2023-08-02, <strong>A Neutrino Detector Design for Safeguarding Small Modular Reactors</strong>, Emma Houston et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01306v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.01306v1</a></p>

<p>Nuclear reactors have long been a favored source for antineutrino measurements for estimates of power and burnup. With appropriate detector parameters and background rejection, an estimate of the reactor power can be derived from the measured antineutrino event rate. Antineutrino detectors are potentially attractive as a safeguards technology that can monitor reactor operations and thermal power from a distance. Advanced reactors have diverse features that may present challenges for current safeguards methods. By comparison, neutrino detectors offer complementary features, including a remote, continuous, unattended, and near-real-time monitoring capability, that may make them useful for safeguarding certain classes of advanced reactors. This study investigates the minimum depth and size of an antineutrino detector for a SMR to meet safeguards needs for advanced reactors. Extrapolating performance from several prior reactor antineutrino experiments, this study uses an analytical approach to develop a possible design for a remote antineutrino-based monitoring device.</p>

<p>2023-08-02, <strong>Swampland criteria and neutrino generation in a non-cold dark matter universe</strong>, Martiros Khurshudyan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01233v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.01233v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, the implications of string Swampland criteria for a dark energy-dominated universe, where we have a deviation from the cold dark matter model, will be discussed. In particular, we have considered two models. One of them is one parameter model, while the second one has been crafted to reveal the dynamics in the deviation. The analysis has been obtained through the use of Gaussian processes (GPs) and $H(z)$ expansion rate data (a $30$-point sample deduced from a differential age method and a $10$-point sample obtained from the radial BAO method). We learned that the tension with the Swampland criteria still will survive as in the cases of the models where dark matter is cold. In the analysis besides mentioned $40$-point $H(z)$ data, we used the latest values of $H_{0}$ reported by the Planck and Hubble missions to reveal possible solutions for the $H_{0}$ tension problem. Finally, the constraints on the neutrino generation number have been obtained revealing interesting results to be discussed yet. This and various related questions have been left to be discussed in forthcoming papers.</p>

<p>2023-08-02, <strong>Search for Galactic core-collapse supernovae in a decade of data taken with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</strong>, IceCube Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01172v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.01172v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has been continuously taking data to search for O(0.5-10) s long neutrino bursts since 2007. Even if a Galactic core-collapse supernova is optically obscured or collapses to a black hole instead of exploding, it will be detectable via the O(10) MeV neutrino burst emitted during the collapse. We discuss a search for such events covering the time between April 17, 2008 and December 31, 2019. Considering the average data taking and analysis uptime of 91.7% after all selection cuts, this is equivalent to 10.735 years of continuous data taking. In order to test the most conservative neutrino production scenario, the selection cuts were optimized for a model based on a 8.8 solar mass progenitor collapsing to an O-Ne-Mg core. Conservative assumptions on the effects of neutrino oscillations in the exploding star were made. The final selection cut was set to ensure that the probability to detect such a supernova within the Milky Way exceeds 99%. No such neutrino burst was found in the data after performing a blind analysis. Hence, a 90% C.L. upper limit on the rate of core-collapse supernovae out to distances of ~ 25kpc was determined to be 0.23/yr. For the more distant Magellanic Clouds, only high neutrino luminosity supernovae will be detectable by IceCube, unless external information on the burst time is available. We determined a model-independent limit by parameterizing the dependence on the neutrino luminosity and the energy spectrum.</p>

<p>2023-08-02, <strong>Beaming patterns of neutrino emission from photo-pion production in relativistic jets</strong>, Markus Boettcher et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01083v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.01083v1</a></p>

<p>In the light of growing evidence that blazars are responsible for part of the astrophysical very-high-energy neutrino flux detected by IceCube, models for neutrino production through photo-pion interactions in blazar jets have been developed. Evidence is also mounting that photon fields originating external to the jet are strongly favored over the co-moving primary electron synchrotron photon field as target for photo-pion interactions. Even though those external photon fields appear highly anisotropic in the co-moving frame of the emission region, current models usually consider neutrino production to occur isotropically in the co-moving frame, resulting in a beaming pattern that is identical to intrinsically isotropic synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission. In this paper, we derive the resulting beaming patterns of neutrinos produced by interactions wich external photon fields, taking into account all relevant anisotropy effects. It is shown that neutrino emission resulting from photo-pion production on a stationary and isotropic (in the AGN rest frame) external photon field is significantly more strongly beamed along the jet direction than intrinsically isotropic emission. For the most highly beamed sources, this implies that expected neutrino fluxes are grossly under-estimated or jet-power requirements for the production of a given neutrino flux grossly over-estimated when not accounting for the proper Doppler boosting and beaming characteristics.</p>

<p>2023-08-02, <strong>Searching for high-energy neutrinos from shock-interaction powered supernovae with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</strong>, Massimiliano Lincetto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01047v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.01047v1</a></p>

<p>The sources of the astrophysical neutrino flux discovered by IceCube are for the most part unresolved. Extragalactic core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) have been suggested as candidate multi-messenger sources. In interaction-powered supernovae, a shock propagates in a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), producing a bright optical emission and potentially accelerating particles to relativistic energies. Shock interaction is believed to be the main energy source for Type IIn supernovae (identified by narrow lines in the spectrum), hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae and a subset of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae. Production of high-energy neutrinos is expected in collisions between the accelerated protons in the shocks and the cold CSM particles. We select a catalog of interaction-powered supernovae from the Bright Transient Survey of the Zwicky Transient Facility. We exploit a novel modeling effort that connects the time evolution of the optical emission to the properties of the ejecta and the CSM, allowing us to set predictions of the neutrino flux for each source. In this contribution, we describe a stacking search for high-energy neutrinos from this population of CCSNe with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.</p>

<p>2023-08-02, <strong>Embedded Software of the KM3NeT Central Logic Board</strong>, S. Aiello et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01032v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.01032v1</a></p>

<p>The KM3NeT Collaboration is building and operating two deep sea neutrino telescopes at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. The telescopes consist of latices of photomultiplier tubes housed in pressure-resistant glass spheres, called digital optical modules and arranged in vertical detection units. The two main scientific goals are the determination of the neutrino mass ordering and the discovery and observation of high-energy neutrino sources in the Universe. Neutrinos are detected via the Cherenkov light, which is induced by charged particles originated in neutrino interactions. The photomultiplier tubes convert the Cherenkov light into electrical signals that are acquired and timestamped by the acquisition electronics. Each optical module houses the acquisition electronics for collecting and timestamping the photomultiplier signals with one nanosecond accuracy. Once finished, the two telescopes will have installed more than six thousand optical acquisition nodes, completing one of the more complex networks in the world in terms of operation and synchronization. The embedded software running in the acquisition nodes has been designed to provide a framework that will operate with different hardware versions and functionalities. The hardware will not be accessible once in operation, which complicates the embedded software architecture. The embedded software provides a set of tools to facilitate remote manageability of the deployed hardware, including safe reconfiguration of the firmware. This paper presents the architecture and the techniques, methods and implementation of the embedded software running in the acquisition nodes of the KM3NeT neutrino telescopes.</p>

<p>2023-08-02, <strong>An improved infrastructure for the IceCube realtime system</strong>, Massimiliano Lincetto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01031v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.01031v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube realtime alert system has been operating since 2016. It provides prompt alerts on high-energy neutrino events to the astroparticle physics community. The localization regions for the incoming direction of neutrinos are published through NASAâs Gamma-ray Coordinate Network (GCN). The IceCube realtime system consists of infrastructure dedicated to the selection of alert events, the reconstruction of their topology and arrival direction, the calculation of directional uncertainty contours and the distribution of the event information through public alert networks. Using a message-based workflow management system, a dedicated software (SkyDriver) provides a representational state transfer (REST) interface to parallelized reconstruction algorithms. In this contribution, we outline the improvements of the internal infrastructure of the IceCube realtime system that aims to streamline the internal handling of neutrino events, their distribution to the SkyDriver interface, the collection of the reconstruction results as well as their conversion into human- and machine-readable alerts to be publicly distributed through different alert networks. An approach for the long-term storage and cataloging of alert events according to findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR) principles is outlined.</p>

<p>2023-08-02, <strong>Estimating the coincidence rate between the optical and radio array of IceCube-Gen2</strong>, Felix SchlÃ¼ter et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00961v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00961v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube-Gen2 Neutrino Observatory is proposed to extend the all-flavour energy range of IceCube beyond PeV energies. It will comprise two key components: I) An enlarged 8$\,$km$^3$ in-ice optical Cherenkov array to measure the continuation of the IceCube astrophysical neutrino flux and improve IceCubeâs point source sensitivity above $\sim\,$100$\,$TeV; and II) A very large in-ice radio array with a surface area of about 500$\,$km$^2$. Radio waves propagate through ice with a kilometer-long attenuation length, hence a sparse radio array allows us to instrument a huge volume of ice to achieve a sufficient sensitivity to detect neutrinos with energies above tens of PeV. The different signal topologies for neutrino-induced events measured by the optical and in-ice radio detector - the radio detector is mostly sensitive to the cascades produced in the neutrino interaction, while the optical detector can detect long-ranging muon and tau leptons with high accuracy - yield highly complementary information. When detected in coincidence, these signals will allow us to reconstruct the neutrino energy and arrival direction with high fidelity. Furthermore, if events are detected in coincidence with a sufficient rate, they resemble the unique opportunity to study systematic uncertainties and to cross-calibrate both detector components. We present the expected rate of coincidence events for 10 years of operation. Furthermore, we analyzed possible detector optimizations to increase the coincidence rate.</p>

<p>2023-08-01, <strong>How Many Dark Neutrino Sectors Does Cosmology Allow?</strong>, Alan Zander et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00798v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00798v1</a></p>

<p>We present the very first constraints on the number of Standard Model (SM) copies with an additional Dirac right-handed neutrino. We show that solving the hierarchy problem within this framework induces in turn a severe hierarchy between the neutrino Yukawa couplings. By demanding the absence of such unnatural hierarchies, we are even able to rule out the theory.</p>

<p>2023-08-01, <strong>Black Holes as Neutrino Factories</strong>, Yifan Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00741v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00741v1</a></p>

<p>Ultralight bosons can grow substantially in the vicinity of a black hole, through superradiant energy extraction. Consequently, such bosons can potentially reach field values close to the Planck scale, making black holes powerful transducers of such fields. If a scalar field couples to neutrino, it can trigger parametric production of neutrinos, and potentially quench their superradiant growth. During this saturation phase, scalar clouds can accelerate neutrinos to the TeV energy scale, generating fluxes that surpass those produced by atmospheric neutrinos.</p>

<p>2023-08-01, <strong>Lepton-Nucleus Interactions within Microscopic Approaches</strong>, Alexis Nikolakopoulos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00736v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00736v1</a></p>

<p>This review paper emphasizes the significance of microscopic calculations with quantified theoretical error estimates in studying lepton-nucleus interactions and their implications for electron-scattering and accelerator neutrino-oscillation measurements. We investigate two approaches: Greenâs Function Monte Carlo and the extended factorization scheme, utilizing realistic nuclear target spectral functions. In our study, we include relativistic effects in Greenâs Function Monte Carlo and validate the inclusive electron-scattering cross section on carbon using available data. We compare the flux folded cross sections for neutrino-Carbon scattering with T2K and MINER$\nu$A experiments, noting the substantial impact of relativistic effects in reducing the theoretical curve strength when compared to MINER$\nu$A data. Additionally, we demonstrate that quantum Monte Carlo-based spectral functions accurately reproduce the quasi-elastic region in electron-scattering data and T2K flux folded cross sections. By comparing results from Greenâs Function Monte Carlo and the spectral function approach, which share a similar initial target state description, we quantify errors associated with approximations in the factorization scheme and the relativistic treatment of kinematics in Greenâs Function Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>With four different type of neutrino-induced interactions, we considered to investigate and reanalyse the KNO scaling in modified multiplicity distributions from a different perspective. In an attempt of first of its kind, we propose alternate fitting function to parameterise the distribution than the most widely adopted Slatteryâs function and compare it with yet another form. We propose the shifted Gompertz and Weibull functions as the fitting functions and compare their potency for the most conventional form of Slatteryâs function. In addition the analysis of the data by evaluating the central moments and factorial moments, we show the dependence of moments on the target size.</p>

<p>2023-08-02, <strong>Detecting Dark Domain Walls</strong>, Kate Clements et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01179v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.01179v1</a></p>

<p>Light scalar fields, with double well potentials and direct matter couplings, undergo density driven phase transitions, leading to the formation of domain walls. Such theories could explain dark energy, dark matter or source the nanoHz gravitational-wave background. We describe an experiment that could be used to detect such domain walls in a laboratory experiment, solving for the scalar field profile, and showing how the domain wall affects the motion of a test particle. We find that, in currently unconstrained regions of parameter space, the domain walls leave detectable signatures.</p>

<p>2023-08-02, <strong>Axion-like particles and high-energy gamma rays: interconversion revisited</strong>, Rafael Alves Batista et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00935v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00935v1</a></p>

<p>Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical entities often invoked to solve various problems in particle physics to cosmology. They are one of the most promising candidates to explain the elusive dark matter. A way to search for ALPs is through their effects on photons. In the presence of external magnetic fields, ALPs and photons can convert into one another, leading to measurable signals. In this contribution we present results of Monte Carlo simulations of ALP-photon interconversion in magnetised environments. We focus on high-energy gamma rays with TeV energies travelling over cosmological distances. We include a full treatment of the intergalactic electromagnetic cascades triggered by the gamma rays. Finally, we discuss the impact of this improved treatment of the propagation for current and future ALP searches.</p>

<p>2023-08-01, <strong>Do assumptions about the central density of subhaloes affect dark matter annihilation and lensing calculations?</strong>, Nicole E. Drakos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00830v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00830v1</a></p>

<p>A growing body of evidence suggests that the central density of cuspy dark matter subhaloes is conserved in minor mergers. However, empirical models of subhalo evolution, calibrated from simulations, often assume a drop in the central density. Since empirical models of subhaloes are used in galaxy-galaxy lensing studies and dark matter annihilation calculations, we explore the consequences of assuming different subhalo models. We find that dark matter annihilation calculations are very sensitive to the assumed subhalo mass profile, and different models can give more than a magnitude difference in the J-factor and boost factor in individual haloes. On the other hand, the shear and convergence profiles used in galaxy-galaxy lensing are sensitive to the initial profile assumed (e.g., NFW versus Einato) but are otherwise well-approximated by a simple model in which the original profile is sharply truncated. We conclude that since the innermost parts of haloes are difficult to resolve in simulations, it is important to have a theoretical understanding of how subhaloes evolve to make accurate predictions of the dark matter annihilation signal.</p>

<p>2023-08-01, <strong>Search for an invisible scalar in $t \bar{t}$ final states at the LHC</strong>, Duarte Azevedo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00819v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00819v1</a></p>

<p>We use the current $t\bar t$ experimental analysis to look for Dark Matter (DM) particles hidden in the final state. We present a phenomenological study where we successfully perform the reconstruction of a $t\bar{t}$ system in the presence of a scalar mediator $Y_0$, that couples to both Standard Model (SM) and to DM particles. We use a \texttt{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO} simplified DM model, where signal samples of $pp \rightarrow t\bar{t}Y_0$ are generated at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with both Charge-Parity (CP) -even and CP-odd couplings of $Y_0$ to the top quarks. Different mass scales for the $Y_0$ mediator are considered, from the low mass region ($\sim$ 0~GeV) to masses close to the Higgs boson mass (125~GeV). The dileptonic final states of the $t\bar{t}$ system were used in our analysis. The reconstruction of the $t\bar{t}$ system is done with a kinematic fit, without reconstructing the mediator. All relevant SM backgrounds for the dileptonic $t\bar{t}$ search at the LHC are considered. Furthermore, CP angular observables were used to probe the CP-nature of the coupling between the mediator and top-quarks, which allowed to set confidence level (CL) limits for those Yukawa couplings as a function of the mediator mass.</p>

<p>The current observational properties of neutron stars have not definitively ruled out the possibility of dark matter. In this study, we primarily focus on exploring correlations between the dark matter model parameters and different neutron star properties using a rich set of EOSs. We adopt a two-fluid approach to calculate the properties of neutron stars. For the nuclear matter EOS, we employ several realistic EOS derived from the relativistic mean field model (RMF), each exhibiting varying stiffness and composition. In parallel, we look into the dark matter EOS, considering fermionic matter with repulsive interaction described by a relativistic mean field Lagrangian. A reasonable range of parameters is sampled meticulously. Interestingly, our results reveal a promising correlation between the dark matter model parameters and stellar properties, particularly when we ignore the uncertainties in the nuclear matter EOS. However, when introducing uncertainties in the nuclear sector, the correlation weakens, suggesting that the task of conclusively constraining any particular dark matter model might be challenging using global properties alone, such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Notably, we find that dark-matter admixed stars tend to have higher central baryonic density, potentially allowing for non-nucleonic degrees of freedom or direct Urca processes in stars with lower masses. There is also a tantalizing hint regarding the detection of stars with the same mass but different surface temperatures, which may indicate the presence of dark matter. With our robust and extensive dataset, we delve deeper and demonstrate that even in the presence of dark matter, the semi-universal C-Love relation remains intact.</p>

<p>Galaxy clusters are promising targets for indirect detection of dark matter thanks to the large dark matter content. Using 14 years of Fermi-LAT data from seven nearby galaxy clusters, we obtain constraints on the lifetime of decaying very heavy dark matter particles with masses ranging from $10^3$ GeV to $10^{16}$ GeV. We consider a variety of decaying channels and calculate prompt gamma rays and electrons/positrons from the dark matter. Furthermore, we take into account electromagnetic cascades induced by the primary gamma rays and electrons/positrons, and search for the resulting gamma-ray signals from the directions of the galaxy clusters. We adopt a Navarro-Frenk-White profile of the dark matter halos, and use the profile likelihood method to set lower limits on the dark matter lifetime at a 95% confidence level. Our results are competitive with those obtained through other gamma-ray observations of galaxy clusters and provide complementary constraints to existing indirect searches for decaying very heavy dark matter.</p>

<p>We study an extension of the Standard Model (SM) with two candidates for dark matter (DM) which includes a Dirac fermion and a Vector Dark Matter (VDM) under new $U(1)$ gauge group in the hidden sector. The model is classically scale invariant and the electroweak symmetry breaks because of the loop effects. We investigate the model parameter space allowed by current experimental constraints and phenomenological bounds. It is shown that the model can be satisfied for the large part of parameter space of VDM mass and fermion dark matter mass, i.e., $400&lt; M_V&lt;3000$ GeV and $M_{\psi}&lt;400$ GeV.The electroweak phase transition have been discussed and shown that there is region in the parameter space of the model consistent with DM relic density, direct detection and collider constraints, while at the same time can lead to first order electroweak phase transition. The gravitational waves produced during the phase transition could be probed by future space-based interferometers such as LISA and BBO.</p>

<p>Fully analytical dynamical models usually have an infinite extent, while real star clusters, galaxies, and dark matter haloes have a finite extent. The standard method for generating dynamical models with a finite extent consists of taking a model with an infinite extent and applying a truncation in binding energy. This method, however, cannot be used to generate models with a pre-set analytical mass density profile. We investigate the self-consistency and dynamical properties of a family of power-law spheres with a general tangential Cuddeford (TC) orbital structure. By varying the density power-law slope $\gamma$ and the central anisotropy $\beta_0$, these models cover a wide parameter space in density and anisotropy profiles. We explicitly calculate the phase-space distribution function for various parameter combinations, and interpret our results in terms of the energy distribution of bound orbits. We find that truncated power-law spheres can be supported by a TC orbital structure if and only if $\gamma \geqslant 2\beta_0$, which means that the central density slope-anisotropy inequality is both a sufficient and a necessary condition for this family. We provide closed expressions for structural and dynamical properties such as the radial and tangential velocity dispersion profiles, which can be compared against more complex numerical modelling results. This work significantly adds to the available suite of self-consistent dynamical models with a finite extent and an analytical description.</p>

<p>In this paper, we present several explicit reconstructions for a novel relativistic theory of modified Newtonian dynamics (RMOND) derived from the background of Friedmann-Lema$\hat{\text{\i}}$tre-Robertson-Walker cosmological evolution. It is shown that the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian with a positive cosmological constant is the only Lagrangian capable of accurately replicating the exact expansion history of the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) universe filled solely with dust-like matter and the only way to achieve this expansion history for the RMOND theory is to introduce additional degrees of freedom to the matter sectors. Besides, we find that the $\Lambda$CDM-era also can be replicated without any real matter field within the framework of the RMOND theory and the cosmic evolution exhibited by both the power-law and de-Sitter solutions also can be obtained.</p>

<p>When subhalos infall into galaxy clusters, their gas content is ram pressure stripped by the intracluster medium (ICM) and may turn into cometary tails. We report the discovery of two spectacular X-ray double tails in a single galaxy cluster, Z8338, revealed by 70 ks Chandra observations. The brighter one, with an X-ray bolometric luminosity of $3.9 \times 10^{42}{\rm\ erg\ s}^{-1}$, is a detached tail stripped from the host halo and extended at least 250 kpc in projection. The head of the detached tail is a cool core with the front tip of the cold front $\sim$ 30 kpc away from the nucleus of its former host galaxy. The cooling time of the detached cool core is $\sim 0.3$ Gyr. For the detached gas, the gravity of the once-associated dark matter halo further enhances the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability. From its survival, we find that a magnetic field of a few $\mu$G is required to suppress the hydrodynamic instability. The X-ray temperature in the tail increases from 0.9 keV at the front tip to 1.6 keV in the wake region, which suggests the turbulent mixing with the hotter ICM. The fainter double X-ray tail, with a total X-ray luminosity of $2.7 \times 10^{42}{\rm\ erg\ s}^{-1}$, appears to stem from the cool core of a subcluster in Z8338, and likely was formed during the ongoing merger. This example suggests that X-ray cool cores can be displaced and eventually destroyed by mergers, while the displaced cool cores can survive for some extended period of time.</p>

<p>The absorption of fermionic dark matter has recently been studied as a signature for the direct detection of dark matter. We construct the first UV completion of the scalar effective operator associated with this signature. We calculate the constraints on the model and demonstrate there is viable parameter space which can be probed by a next-generation experiment such as XLZD. We also consider the cosmological history of our model and show that the correct relic abundance can be obtained via freeze-out in the dark sector. However, within this minimal model, we find that the absorption signal is highly suppressed in the parameter space that yields the correct relic abundance.</p>

<p>We present a novel interpretation of the thermodynamics of perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) black hole based on Misner-Sharp energy, and then investigate its evaporation behavior. We find that the ratio between dark sector initial density and black hole horizon radius significantly influences black hole evaporation behaviors. We demonstrate that the presence of the dark sector can significantly extend the lifetime of a black hole which is similar to the Reissner-Nordstrom case. Our work reformulates the thermodynamics of PFDM black holes and points out the existence of long-lived black holes in the presence of the dark sector.</p>

<p>The scattering of sub-GeV dark matter in direct detection experiments happens at characteristic wavelengths comparable or larger than the interparticle spacing. Collective effects in the target material must therefore be accounted for when calculating the scattering rate. For dark matter-nucleon couplings, this implies matching onto the appropriate phonon effective theory and calculating single and multi-phonon scattering amplitudes. For dark matter-electron couplings, we make use of the energy loss formalism to predict the scattering rate. Combining both techniques allows us to derive a formula for the Migdal effect in crystals, which differs from prior calculations performed in atomic systems.</p>

Origin and evolution of neutron-capture elements as probed by the Gaia-ESO survey</strong>, Jianhui Lian et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01111v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.01111v1</a></p>

<p>Most heavy elements beyond the iron peak are synthesized via neutron capture processes. The nature of the astrophysical sites of neutron capture processes is still very unclear. In this work we explore the observational constraints of the chemical abundances of s-process and r-process elements on the sites of neutron-capture processes by applying Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models to the data from Gaia-ESO large spectroscopic stellar survey. For the r-process, the [Eu/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution suggests a short delay time of the site that produces Eu. Other independent observations (e.g., NS-NS binaries), however, suggest a significant fraction of long delayed ($&gt;1$Gyr) neutron star mergers (NSM). When assuming NSM as the only r-process sites, these two observational constraints are inconsistent at above 1$\sigma$ level. Including short delayed r-process sites like magneto-rotational supernova can resolve this inconsistency. For the s-process, we find a weak metallicity dependence of the [Ba/Y] ratio, which traces the s-process efficiency. Our GCE model with up-to-date yields of AGB stars qualitatively reproduces this metallicity dependence, but the model predicts a much higher [Ba/Y] ratio compared to the data. This mismatch suggests that the s-process efficiency of low mass AGB stars in the current AGB nucleosynthesis models could be overestimated.</p>

Nagao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00996v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00996v1</a></p>

<p>The explosion processes of supernovae (SNe) are imprinted in their explosion geometries. Here, we study the intrinsic polarization of 15 hydrogen-rich core-collapse SNe and explore the relation with the photometric and spectroscopic properties. Our sample shows diverse properties of the continuum polarization. The polarization of most SNe has a low degree at early phases but shows a sudden rise to $\sim 1$ \% degree at certain points during the photospheric phase as well as a slow decline during the tail phase, with a constant polarization angle. The variation in the timing of peak polarisation values implies diversity in the explosion geometry: some SNe have aspherical structures only in their helium cores, while in other SNe these reach out to a significant part of the outer hydrogen envelope with a common axis from the helium core to the hydrogen envelope. Other SNe show high polarization from early phases and a change of the polarization angle around the middle of the photospheric phase. This implies that the ejecta are significantly aspherical to the outermost layer and have multi-directional aspherical structures. Exceptionally, the Type~IIL SN~2017ahn shows low polarization at both the photospheric and tail phases. Our results show that the timing of the polarization rise in Type~IIP SNe is likely correlated with their brightness, velocity and the amount of radioactive Ni produced: brighter SNe with faster ejecta velocity and a larger $^{56}$Ni mass have more extended-aspherical explosion geometries. In particular, there is a clear correlation between the timing of the polarization rise and the explosion energy, that is, the explosion asphericity is proportional to the explosion energy. This implies that the development of a global aspherical structure, e.g., a jet, might be the key to realising an energetic SN in the mechanism of SN explosions.</p>

<p>We present cosmological analysis of 12 nearby ($z&lt;0.06$) Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) observed with the ROTSE-IIIb telescope. To achieve precise photometry, we present a new image differencing technique that is implemented for the first time on the ROTSE SN photometry pipeline. With this method, we find up to a 20\% increase in the detection efficiency and significant reduction in residual RMS scatter of the SN lightcurves when compared to the previous pipeline performance. We use the published optical spectra and broadband photometry of well studied SNe IIP to establish temporal models for ejecta velocity and photospheric temperature evolution for our SNe IIP population. This study yields measurements that are competitive to other methods even when the data are limited to a single epoch during the photospheric phase of SNe IIP. Using the fully reduced ROTSE photometry and optical spectra, we apply these models to the respective photometric epochs for each SN in the ROTSE IIP sample. This facilitates the use of the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM) to obtain distance estimates to their respective host galaxies. We then perform cosmological parameter fitting using these EPM distances from which we measure the Hubble constant to be $72.9^{+5.7}_{-4.3}~{\rm kms^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, which is consistent with the standard $\Lambda CDM$ model values derived using other independent techniques.</p>

<p>In this work, a two-fluid interacting model in a flat FLRW universe has been studied considering particle creation mechanism with a particular form of particle creation rate $\Gamma=\Gamma_0 H+\frac{\Gamma_1}{H}$ from different aspects. Statistical analysis with a combined data set of SNe Ia (Supernovae Type Ia) and Hubble data is performed to achieve the best-fit values of the model parameters, and the model is compatible with current observational data. We also perform a dynamical analysis of this model to get an overall qualitative description of the cosmological evolution by converting the governing equations into a system of ordinary differential equations considering a proper transformation of variables. We find some non-isolated sets of critical points, among which some usually are normally hyperbolic sets of points that describe the present acceleration of the Universe dominated by dark energy mimicking cosmological constant or phantom fluid. Scaling solutions are also obtained from this analysis, and they can alleviate the coincidence problem successfully. Finally, the thermodynamic analysis shows that the Generalized second law of thermodynamics is valid in an irreversible thermodynamic context.</p>

<p>2023-08-01, <strong>A Nitrogen-rich SNR in M31: SNR Interaction with the CSM at Late Times</strong>, Nelson Caldwell et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00754v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00754v1</a></p>

<p>We present the discovery of a supernova remnant (SNR) in M31 which is unlike any other remnant known in that galaxy. An optical MMT spectrum of WB92-26 sampling most of this marginally resolved object reveals strong lines of [O II], [Ne III], H I, [O III], [O I], [N II] and [S II], though the H I lines are very weak and the [N II] lines are very strong. Multiple velocity components are visible in those lines, with broad wings extending to $-2000$ and $+1500$ or $2000$ km/s (the heliocentric velocity of M31 is $-300$ km/s). The lines show strong peaks or shoulders near $-750$ km/s, $-50$ km/s, and $+800$ km/s in the M31 frame.   The density implied by the [S II] ratio combined with the X-ray luminosity, FUV flux and optical size lead us to conclude that the optical emission lines are generated by shock waves, not photoionization. Consideration of the velocity structure indicates that the emission is from a shock in the circumstellar medium (CSM). This CSM must be depleted in H and enriched in He and N through CNO processing, and it must have had a high velocity before the explosion of the parent star, to explain the broad wings in the emission lines. We estimate the CSM shell to have a mass of 2 Msun, implying a Core Collapse SN. It is likely that Eta Car will produce a remnant resembling WB92-26 a few thousand years after it explodes.</p>

<p>2023-08-01, <strong>Fast and efficient identification of anomalous galaxy spectra with neural density estimation</strong>, Vanessa BÃ¶hm et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00752v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00752v1</a></p>

<p>Current large-scale astrophysical experiments produce unprecedented amounts of rich and diverse data. This creates a growing need for fast and flexible automated data inspection methods. Deep learning algorithms can capture and pick up subtle variations in rich data sets and are fast to apply once trained. Here, we study the applicability of an unsupervised and probabilistic deep learning framework, the Probabilistic Autoencoder (PAE), to the detection of peculiar objects in galaxy spectra from the SDSS survey. Different to supervised algorithms, this algorithm is not trained to detect a specific feature or type of anomaly, instead it learns the complex and diverse distribution of galaxy spectra from training data and identifies outliers with respect to the learned distribution. We find that the algorithm assigns consistently lower probabilities (higher anomaly score) to spectra that exhibit unusual features. For example, the majority of outliers among quiescent galaxies are E+A galaxies, whose spectra combine features from old and young stellar population. Other identified outliers include LINERs, supernovae and overlapping objects. Conditional modeling further allows us to incorporate additional information. Namely, we evaluate the probability of an object being anomalous given a certain spectral class, but other information such as metrics of data quality or estimated redshift could be incorporated as well. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/VMBoehm/Spectra_PAE</p>
