<p>2024-07-18, <strong>Revisiting Neutrino Masses In Clockwork Models</strong>, Aadarsh Singh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13733v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.13733v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we have looked at various variants of the clockwork model and studied their impact on the neutrino masses. Some of the generalizations such as generalized CW and next-to-nearest neighbour interaction CW have already been explored by a few authors. In this study, we studied non-local CW for the fermionic case and found that non-local models relax the $\left| q \right| &gt; 1$ constraint to produce localization of the zero mode. We also made a comparison among them and have shown that for some parameter ranges, non-local variants of CW are more efficient than ordinary CW in generating the hierarchy required for the $\nu$ mass scale. Finally, phenomenological constraints from $BR(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma )$ FCNC process and Higgs decay width have been imposed on the parameter space in non-local and both-sided clockwork models. We have listed benchmark points which are surviving current experimental bounds from MEG and are within the reach of the upcoming MEG-II experiment.</p>

<p>2024-07-18, <strong>Cross-correlations of the Cosmic Neutrino Background: HR-DEMNUni simulation analysis</strong>, Beatriz Hernández-Molinero et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13727v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.13727v1</a></p>

<p>We use the high-resolution HR-DEMNUni simulations to compute cross-correlations of the Cosmic Neutrino Background C$_{\nu}$B with other observables, namely: cold dark matter density, effective weak lensing convergence, neutrino velocity and neutrino deflection angle. We provide, for the first time, this high-fidelity cross-correlation maps in order to illustrate how much can be learned from them once the cosmic neutrino background is measured. As cross-correlations will have more signal than auto-correlations of the C$_{\nu}$B itself, these might be the ones to be measured first by Ptolemy-like experiments. Our predictions thus provide the imprint of what massive neutrinos should look like from cosmological observations.</p>

<p>2024-07-18, <strong>On the collider-testability of the type-I seesaw model with 3 right-handed neutrinos</strong>, Marco Drewes et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13620v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.13620v1</a></p>

<p>If any heavy neutral leptons are discovered in accelerator-based experiments, key questions will involve their possible connection to neutrino masses or leptogenesis. Working in a renormalisable extension of the Standard Model by three right-handed neutrinos, we address the question of how much information about the fundamental model parameters can be obtained by measuring the branching ratios in the decays of the heavy neutral leptons into individual SM generations. We find that, provided that these branching ratios could be measured with arbitrary precision, they would be sufficient to pin down all 18 parameters of the model when supplemented with light neutrino oscillation data. When considering a finite statistical uncertainty comparable to that which can be achieved by future lepton colliders in the mass range of tens of GeV, some parameter degeneracies remain, but measurements would still provide powerful consistency checks of the model. In the sub-GeV range similar sensitivities can be expected for SHiP and DUNE. This shows the potential of these experiments to not only discover heavy neutral leptons, but play an important role in understanding their role in particle physics and cosmology.</p>

<p>2024-07-18, <strong>Small Neutrino Masses from a Decoupled Singlet Scalar Field</strong>, Jongkuk Kim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13595v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.13595v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a unified solution with $Z_4$ discrete symmetry for small neutrino masses and stability of dark matter. Our model consists of an inert doublet scalar, a dark singlet scalar $S$, a spurion scalar $\varphi$ and right-handed neutrinos beyond the Standard Model (SM), which transform nontrivially under $Z_4$. Once the $Z_4$ symmetry is broken to $Z_2$ by the VEV of $\varphi$, much below the mass scale of the singlet scalar $S$, a small quartic coupling between SM Higgs and inert doublets, which violates both $Z_4$ and lepton number, is generated at tree level, so small neutrino masses are obtained at one-loops. We discuss the consistent parameter space for neutrino masses, direct detection and thermal leptogenesis in the model.</p>

<p>2024-07-18, <strong>Quasi two-zero texture in Type-II seesaw at fixed points from modular $A_4$ symmetry</strong>, Takaaki Nomura et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13167v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.13167v1</a></p>

<p>We study a quasi two-zero neutrino texture based on type-II seesaw model in a modular $A_4$ symmetry to evade the cosmological bound on the sum of neutrino mass while keeping some predictability in neutrino sector. Working on three fixed points for modulus, we discuss predictions of the model and show the allowed points satisfying the cosmological bound on neutrino mass from both CMB and CMB+BAO data.</p>

<p>2024-07-18, <strong>On the consistency of rotation curves and spatially integrated HI flux profiles</strong>, Tariq Yasin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13754v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.13754v1</a></p>

<p>Resolved rotation curves (RCs) are the gold-standard measurements for inferring dark matter distributions in $\Lambda$CDM and testing alternative theories of dynamics in galaxies. However they are expensive to obtain, making them prohibitive for large galaxy samples and at higher redshift. Spatially integrated HI flux profiles are more accessible and present the information in a different form, but – except in a highly compressed form, as linewidths – have not so far been compared in detail with RCs or employed for dynamical inferences. Here we study the consistency of RCs and HI surface density profiles from SPARC with spatially integrated HI flux profiles from ALFALFA, by combining the resolved properties in a forward model for the flux profile. We define a new metric for asymmetry in the flux profiles, enabling us to cleanly identify those unsuitable for our axisymmetric method. Among all SPARC galaxies the agreement between RCs and flux profiles is satisfactory within the limitations of the data – with most galaxies having an uncertainty normalised mean squared error (MSE) below 10 – while no galaxy deemed symmetric has a MSE above 1.2. Most cases of good agreement prefer a HI gas dispersion $\sigma_{\mathrm{HI}}$ of ~13 km/s, consistent with resolved studies of gas dispersion from the literature. These results open the door for spatially integrated HI flux profiles to be used as proxies for spatially resolved dynamics, including a robust appraisal of the degree of asymmetry.</p>

<p>2024-07-18, <strong>Predicting dark matter halo masses from simulated galaxy images and environments</strong>, Austin J. Larson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13735v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.13735v1</a></p>

<p>Galaxies are theorized to form and co-evolve with their dark matter halos, such that their stellar masses and halo masses should be well-correlated. However, it is not known whether other observable galaxy features, such as their morphologies or large-scale environments, can be used to tighten the correlation between galaxy properties and halo masses. In this work, we train a baseline random forest model to predict halo mass using galaxy features from the Illustris TNG50 hydrodynamical simulation, and compare with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) trained respectively using galaxy image cutouts and galaxy point clouds. The best baseline model has a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.310 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.220, compared to the CNN (RSME=0.359, MAE=0.238), GNN (RMSE=0.248, MAE=0.158), and a novel combined CNN+GNN (RMSE=0.248, MAE=0.144). The CNN is likely limited by our small data set, and we anticipate that the CNN and CNN+GNN would benefit from training on larger cosmological simulations. We conclude that deep learning models can leverage information from galaxy appearances and environment, beyond commonly used summary statistics, in order to better predict the halo mass.</p>

<p>2024-07-18, <strong>Dark matter droplets</strong>, Ian G Moss et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13243v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.13243v1</a></p>

<p>A new model for dark matter is put forward which consists of uniform droplets of Bose Einstein condensate. In this model, structure forms rapidly, shortly after the hot big bang plasma de-ionises. The model also produces modifications to the expansion rate before droplet formation that affect the measurement of cosmological parameters from Cosmic Microwave Background data. The model could contribute to explaining why observations at high redshift see anomalously high structure formation and predict low values for the Hubble constant.</p>

<p>2024-07-18, <strong>Axions in Andromeda: Searching for Minicluster – Neutron Star Encounters with the Green Bank Telescope</strong>, Liam Walters et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13060v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.13060v1</a></p>

<p>The QCD axion and axion-like particles are compelling candidates for galactic dark matter. Theoretically, axions can convert into photons in the presence of a strong external magnetic field, which means it is possible to search for them experimentally. One approach is to use radio telescopes with high-resolution spectrometers to look for axion-photon conversion in the magnetospheres of neutron stars. In this paper, we describe the results obtained using a novel approach where we used the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for radio transients produced by collisions between neutron stars and dark matter clumps known as axion miniclusters. We used the VErsatile GBT Astronomical Spectrometer (VEGAS) and the X-band receiver (8 to 10 GHz) to observe the core of Andromeda. Our measurements are sensitive to axions with masses between 33 and 42 $\mu$eV with $\Delta$$m_a$ = 3.8$\times10^{-4}$ $\mu$eV. This paper gives a description of the search method we developed, including observation and analysis strategies. Given our analysis algorithm choices and the instrument sensitivity ($\sim$2 mJy in each spectral channel), we did not find any candidate signals greater than 5$\sigma$. We are currently implementing this search method in other spectral bands.</p>

<p>2024-07-18, <strong>Kinematic constraints on the ages and kick velocities of Galactic neutron star binaries</strong>, Paul Disberg et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13667v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.13667v1</a></p>

<p>The systems creating binary neutron stars (BNSs) experience systemic kicks when one of the components goes supernova. The combined magnitude of these kicks is still a topic of debate, and has implications for the eventual location of the transient resulting from the merger of the binary. For example, the offsets of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) resulting from BNS mergers depend on the BNS kicks. We investigated Galactic BNSs, and traced their motion through the Galaxy. This enabled us to estimate their kinematic ages and construct a BNS kick distribution, based on their Galactic trajectories. We used the pulsar periods and their derivatives to estimate the characteristic spin-down ages of the binaries. Moreover, we used a Monte Carlo estimation of their present-day velocity vector in order to trace back their trajectory and estimate their kinematic ages. These trajectories, in turn, were used to determine the eccentricity of their Galactic orbit. Based on simulations of kicked objects in the Galactic potential, we investigated the relationship between this eccentricity and kick velocity, in order to constrain the kicks imparted to the binaries at birth. We find that the Galactic BNSs are likely older than $\sim40$ Myr, which means their current (scalar) galactocentric speeds are not representative of their initial kicks. However, we find a close relationship between the eccentricity of a Galactic trajectory and the experienced kick. Using this relation, we constrained the kicks of the Galactic BNSs, depending on the kind of isotropy assumed in estimating their velocity vectors. These kick velocities are well-described by a log-normal distribution peaking around $\sim40-50$ km/s, and coincide with the peculiar velocities of the binaries at their last disc crossing.</p>

<p>2024-07-18, <strong>SN 2021wvw: A core-collapse supernova at the sub-luminous, slower, and shorter end of Type IIPs</strong>, Rishabh Singh Teja et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13207v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.13207v1</a></p>

<p>We present detailed multi-band photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis of a rare core-collapse supernova SN 2021wvw, that includes photometric evolution up to 250 d and spectroscopic coverage up to 100 d post-explosion. A unique event that does not fit well within the general trends observed for Type II-P supernovae, SN 2021wvw shows an intermediate luminosity with a short plateau phase of just about 75 d, followed by a very sharp (~10 d) transition to the tail phase. Even in the velocity space, it lies at a lower velocity compared to a larger Type II sample. The observed peak absolute magnitude is -16.1 mag in r-band, and the nickel mass is well constrained to 0.020(6) Msol. Detailed hydrodynamical modeling using MESA+STELLA suggests a radially compact, low-metallicity, high-mass Red Supergiant progenitor (ZAMS mass=18 Msol), which exploded with ~0.2e51 erg/s leaving an ejecta mass of Mej~5 Msol. Significant late-time fallback during the shock propagation phase is also seen in progenitor+explosion models consistent with the light curve properties. As the faintest short-plateau supernova characterized to date, this event adds to the growing diversity of transitional events between the canonical ~100 d plateau Type IIP and stripped-envelope events.</p>

<p>2024-07-18, <strong>Forecasting Supernova Observations with the CSST: I. Photometric Samples</strong>, Chengqi Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13087v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.13087v1</a></p>

<p>The China Space Station Telescope (CSST, also known as Xuntian) is a serviceable two-meter-aperture wide-field telescope operating in the same orbit as the China Space Station. The CSST plans to survey a sky area of 17,500 deg$^2$ of the medium-to-high Galactic latitude to a depth of 25-26 AB mag in at least 6 photometric bands over 255-1000 nm. Within such a large sky area, slitless spectra will also be taken over the same wavelength range as the imaging survey. Even though the CSST survey is not dedicated to time-domain studies, it would still detect a large number of transients, such as supernovae (SNe). In this paper, we simulate photometric SN observations based on a strawman survey plan using the Sncosmo package. During its 10-year survey, the CSST is expected to observe about 5 million SNe of various types. With quality cuts, we obtain a “gold” sample that comprises roughly 7,400 SNe Ia, 2,200 SNe Ibc, and 6,500 SNe II candidates with correctly classified percentages reaching 91%, 63%, and 93% (formally defined as classification precision), respectively. The same survey can also trigger alerts for the detection of about 15,500 SNe Ia (precision 61%) and 2,100 SNe II (precision 49%) candidates at least two days before the light maxima. Moreover, the near-ultraviolet observations of the CSST will be able to catch hundreds of shock-cooling events serendipitously every year. These results demonstrate that the CSST can make a potentially significant contribution to SN studies.</p>
