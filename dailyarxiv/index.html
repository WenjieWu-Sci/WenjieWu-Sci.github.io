<p>2026-01-06, <strong>Study of sub-GeV Dipolar Dark States at SND@LHC within Invisible Bounds on Meson Decays</strong>, Debajyoti Biswas et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03186v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.03186v1</a></p>

<p>Electromagnetic form factors constitute a natural portal for accessing states beyond the Standard Model. In particular, dimension-5 magnetic and electric dipole moment operators offer a minimal and predictive framework for Feebly Interacting Particles (FIPs). In this work, we perform a study of the sensitivity reach of the Scattering and Neutrino Detector (SND@LHC) in the detection of dipolar dark states through photon-mediated interactions with the Standard Model particles. The far-forward region of the LHC provides FIPs with large momenta that scatter off electrons and nuclei inside the target. Production of dark states from meson decays is constrained by invisible decay widths, while the Drell-Yan process offers a production channel in the GeV range. We present sensitivity plots for magnetic and electric dipole moment interactions at SND@LHC and compare them with constraints from direct detection, beam dump, fixed-target, and collider experiments. The validity of the effective theory that describes the dipole model is also studied by considering conservative bounds on the couplings.</p>

<p>We consider models with broken $μ$-$τ$ permutation symmetry through higher dimensional operators   renormalizing the lepton kinetic terms in the action. We study   the consequences on the structure of the neutrino mass matrix and find in particular that the allowed region for the lightest   mass in the normal hierarchy plotted as a function of the atmospheric mixing element   $|V_{\mu3}|$ is very restricted with the atmospheric mixing angle $θ_{23}$ to lie   in the second octant. On the other hand, the corresponding allowed region in the inverted hierarchy regime   is less restrictive.</p>

<p>2026-01-06, <strong>The Study of a Cosmic Ray Candidate Detected by the Askaryan Radio Array</strong>, Shoukat Ali et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02718v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.02718v1</a></p>

<p>Experiments designed to detect ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrinos using radio techniques are also capable of detecting the radio signals from cosmic-ray (CR) induced air showers. These CR signals are important both as a background and as a tool for calibrating the detector. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), a radio detector array, is designed to detect UHE neutrinos. The array currently comprises five independent stations, each instrumented with antennas deployed at depths of up to 200 meters within the ice at the South Pole.   In this study, we focus on a candidate event recorded by ARA Station 2 (A2) that shows features consistent with a downward-going CR-induced air shower. This includes distinctive double-pulse signals in multiple channels, interpreted as geomagnetic and Askaryan radio emissions arriving at the antennas in sequence. To investigate this event, we use detailed simulations that combine a modern ice-impacting CR shower simulation framework, FAERIE, with a realistic detector simulation package, AraSim. We will present results for an optimization of the event topology, identified through simulated CR showers, comparing the vertex reconstruction of both the geomagnetic and Askaryan signals of the event, as well as the observed time delays between the two signals in each antenna.</p>

<p>2026-01-06, <strong>Exploring Lorentz Violation in Spacetime through Universal Finsler Geometry</strong>, Jie Zhu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02711v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.02711v1</a></p>

<p>Finsler geometry serves as a fundamental and natural extension of Riemannian geometry, providing a valuable framework for investigating Lorentz violation in spacetime. Previous studies have treated the Finsler structures associated with different particles as distinct entities. In this paper, we propose a novel hypothesis suggesting that the Finsler structure may represent an intrinsic property of the universe itself. Under this assumption, we derive a series of modified dispersion relations that have not been previously explored, and we analyze their implications. Our findings indicate that the scales of Lorentz violation for massive particles are proportional to their masses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this hypothesis aligns well with existing phenomenological results regarding Lorentz violation observed in photons, neutrinos, and electrons.</p>

<p>2026-01-06, <strong>The Nucleon Axial Form Factor from Averaging Lattice QCD Results</strong>, Aaron S. Meyer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02676v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.02676v1</a></p>

<p>Flagship neutrino oscillation experiments depend on precise and accurate theoretical knowledge of neutrino-nucleon cross sections across a variety of energies and interaction mechanisms. Key ingredients to the amplitudes that make up these cross sections are parameterized form factors. The axial form factor describing a weak interaction with a nucleon is part of one of the primary neutrino-nucleon interaction mechanisms, quasielastic scattering, yet this form factor is uncertain and its precision is limited by the availability of data for a neutrino scattering with nucleons or small nuclear targets. Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD) now offers another approach for obtaining mathematically rigorous constraints of the axial form factor from theoretical calculations with complete systematic error budgets. In this work, strategies for averaging LQCD results are explored, including both a random sampling of form factor values across momentum transfers as well as an averaging strategy based on analytic calculations of form factor derivatives. Fits to z expansion parameterizations are reported and compared against neutrino-hydrogen and neutrino-deuterium scattering data.</p>

<p>2026-01-05, <strong>Dark matter and scalar sector in a novel two-loop scotogenic neutrino mass model</strong>, A. E. Cárcamo Hernández et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02503v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.02503v1</a></p>

<p>We propose an extended $3+1$ Higgs doublet model where the Standard Model (SM) gauge structure is enhanced by the discrete symmetry $Q_6 \times Z_2 \times Z_4$, and the fermion content is extended with right-handed Majorana neutrinos. The scalar sector, besides four $SU(2)$ doublets, incorporates multiple gauge-singlet scalars. In our model, the tiny active neutrino masses arise from a novel radiative seesaw mechanism at two-loop level and the leptonic mixing features the cobimaximal mixing pattern compatible with neutrino oscillation experimental data. Along with this, the proposed model is consistent with SM quark masses and mixings as well as with the constraints arising from dark matter relic density and dark matter direct detection. Our analysis reveals that the best-fit point satisfying dark matter constraints yields a non-SM scalar with mass near $95$ GeV, which could be a possible candidate for the observed $95$ GeV diphoton excess. We further obtain other non SM scalars with masses at the subTeV scale which are within the LHC reach, while successfully complying with the experimental bounds arising from collider searches.</p>

<p>2026-01-05, <strong>Neutrino flavor instabilities in neutron star mergers with moment transport: slow, fast, and collisional modes</strong>, Julien Froustey et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02461v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.02461v1</a></p>

<p>Determining where, when, and how neutrino flavor oscillations must be included in large-scale simulations of hot and dense astrophysical environments is an enduring challenge that must be tackled to obtain accurate predictions. Using an angular moment-based linear stability analysis framework, we examine the different kinds of flavor instabilities that can take place in the context of the post-processing of a neutron star merger simulation, with a particular focus on the collisional flavor instability and a careful assessment of several commonly used approximations. First, neglecting anisotropies of the neutrino field, we investigate the extent to which commonly used monoenergetic growth rates reproduce the results obtained from a full multi-energy treatment. Contrary to the large discrepancies found in core-collapse supernova environments, we propose a simple combination of energy-averaged estimates that reproduces the multi-energy growth rates in our representative simulation snapshot. We then quantify the impact of additional physical effects, including nuclear many-body corrections, scattering opacities, and the inclusion of the vacuum term in the neutrino Hamiltonian. Finally, we include the neutrino distribution anisotropies, which allows us to explore, for the first time in a multi-energy setting, the interplay between collisional, fast, and slow modes in a moment-based neutron star merger simulation. We find that despite a dominance of the fast instability in most of the simulation volume, certain regions only exhibit a collisional instability, while others, especially at large distances, exhibit a slow instability that is largely underestimated if anisotropic effects are neglected.</p>

<p>2026-01-05, <strong>Cosmic Collider Gravitational Waves sourced by Right-handed Neutrino production from Bubbles: Testing Seesaw, Leptogenesis and Dark Matter</strong>, Anish Ghoshal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02458v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.02458v1</a></p>

<p>We study a minimal type-I seesaw framework in which a first-order phase transition (FOPT), driven by a singlet scalar, produces right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) through bubble collisions, realizing a cosmic-scale collider that probes ultra-high energy scales. The resulting RHN distribution sources novel low-frequency gravitational-waves (GWs) in addition to the standard bubble-collision contribution. A stable lightest RHN can account for the observed dark matter (DM) relic abundance for masses as low as $M_{1} \equiv m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, with the associated novel GW signal accessible in LISA, ET and upcoming LVK detectors. If the RHNs are unstable, their CP-violating decays generate the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis for $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and phase transition temperatures $T_* \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, for which the novel GW spectrum is detectable in ET, BBO and upcoming LVK. If RHN decays also populate a dark-sector fermion with mass $m_χ \in [10^{-4},10^{4}],\mathrm{GeV}$, successful co-genesis of baryons and asymmetric dark matter occurs for $T_* \gtrsim 10^{7}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{9}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, naturally explaining $Ω_{\rm DM} \simeq 5Ω_{\rm B}$. The corresponding GW signals are testable with LISA, ET, and BBO. Finally, we analyze a UV-complete multi-Majoron model, based on a global $U(1)_N \times U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ extension, motivated from the hierarchy of lepton masses, which we dub as Mojaron collider. The corresponding FOPT in this model leaves a distinctive GW signature arising from RHN production during $U(1)_N$ symmetry breaking detectable by BBO, ET and upcoming LVK. Successful leptogenesis is realized for heaviest RHN mass $M_3 \sim 10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and a $U(1)_N$ breaking vev $v_2 \sim \mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TeV})$, which sets the seesaw scale.</p>

<p>2026-01-05, <strong>Joint Constraints on Neutrinos and Dynamical Dark Energy in Minimally Modified Gravity</strong>, Artur Ladeira et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02077v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.02077v1</a></p>

<p>The (w_{\dagger})VCDM framework provides a theoretically well-controlled extension of (Λ)CDM within the class of minimally modified gravity theories, allowing for flexible cosmological background evolution and linear perturbation dynamics while remaining free of pathological instabilities. In this work, we have shown that this scenario remains robust when confronted with current cosmological observations, even in the presence of an extended neutrino sector. Combining \textit{Planck} CMB data with DESI DR2 BAO and DESY5 supernovae, we obtain stringent constraints on neutrino physics, including (\sum m_ν&lt; 0.11~\mathrm{eV}) (95\% CL) and (N_{\rm eff} = 2.98^{+0.13}_{-0.14}), fully consistent with Standard Model expectations. Crucially, the data exhibit a statistically significant preference for a late-time dark-energy transition, characterized by a robust quintessence–phantom crossing that remains stable across all dataset combinations and neutrino-sector extensions, including the presence of a sterile neutrino. The combined effects of modified late-time expansion and additional relativistic degrees of freedom systematically raise the inferred Hubble constant, substantially alleviating the (H_0) tension without invoking early dark energy or introducing theoretical instabilities. Overall, the (w_{\dagger})VCDM scenario emerges as a compelling phenomenological framework that simultaneously accommodates current constraints on neutrino physics, provides an excellent fit to recent BAO and supernovae data, and offers a viable pathway toward resolving persistent tensions in the standard cosmological model.</p>

<p>2026-01-05, <strong>Proton Acceleration by Collisionless Shocks in Supermassive Black Hole Coronae: Implications for High-Energy Neutrinos</strong>, Minh Nhat Ly et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01999v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.01999v1</a></p>

<p>Recent observations by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory have revealed a significant excess of high-energy neutrinos from nearby Seyfert galaxies, such as NGC~1068, without a corresponding flux of high-energy gamma-rays. This suggests that neutrinos are produced via hadronic interactions in a region opaque to gamma-rays, likely a hot corona surrounding the central supermassive black hole. However, the mechanism responsible for accelerating the parent protons to the required energies ($\sim 100$ TeV) remains an open question. In this study, we investigate diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in active galactic nucleus (AGN) coronae using a suite of one-dimensional Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations spanning a broad range of plasma parameters. We find that DSA is a robust and efficient mechanism for proton acceleration, consistently channeling approximately 10\% of the shock’s kinetic energy into non-thermal ions, even for shocks with sonic Mach number as low as $ M_s \approx 2$. In contrast, the efficiency of electron acceleration is highly variable and less efficient ($&lt;1\%$) in our parameter survey. These findings provide strong, first-principles support for the hadronic models of neutrino production in AGN and offer quantitative constraints that can explain the observed gamma-ray deficit.</p>

<p>2026-01-05, <strong>Asymmetric Dark Matter from Low-Scale Spontaneous Leptogenesis</strong>, Hiroki Takahashi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01849v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.01849v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate a novel type of asymmetric dark matter (ADM) model in which the dark matter asymmetry and the baryon asymmetry in our universe (BAU) are produced simultaneously via low-scale spontaneous leptogenesis, where the mass scale of right-handed neutrino is much lower than the Davidson-Ibarra bound $M_1 \ll 10^{9}~\rm{GeV}$. In our scenario, both asymmetries are predominantly sourced by a dynamical $CP$ phase, namely the majoron. Its kinetic misalignment provides a sufficiently large, time-dependent effective $CP$ phase, allowing efficient asymmetry production even for low-scale right-handed neutrinos. In our framework, the sources of $CP$ violation responsible for the BAU and ADM are correlated with each other, leading to a predictive relation for the dark matter mass. In particular, when the dark matter asymmetry reaches its equilibrium value before freeze-out, the dark matter mass is typically predicted to lie in the range $\mathcal{O}(0.1)~\mathrm{GeV} \lesssim m_χ \lesssim \mathcal{O}(100)~\mathrm{GeV}$, which lies within the sensitivity of direct detection experiments. On the other hand, if the dark matter asymmetry does not reach its equilibrium value due to weak coupling, the allowed mass range extends over a broader interval, $\mathcal{O}(0.1)~\mathrm{GeV} \lesssim m_χ \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10)~\rm{TeV}$.</p>

<p>2026-01-06, <strong>Late-time Background Constraints on Linear and Non-linear Interacting Dark Energy after DESI DR2</strong>, David Figueruelo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03122v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.03122v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, we present observational constraints on a class of phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) models that admit analytical solutions for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. We consider a set of five linear and three non-linear IDE scenarios, encompassing both interactions proportional to the dark matter and/or dark energy densities, as well as non-linear combinations of the two. For all eight IDE models, we find a better fit than $Λ$CDM from a $Δχ^2$ analysis for both combinations of datasets considered. When using the Akaike Information Criterion ($Δ$AIC), we find a similarly improved fit in all cases, except for one dataset combination in $Q=3Hδρ_{\rm de}$. Our analysis also shows a preference for sign-switching interactions, with energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter at low redshift, reversing direction at higher redshift. These results should be interpreted with caution, as the latter direction of energy transfer is accompanied by negative dark energy densities in the past, which may be unphysical. Models that do not allow sign-changing behaviour instead show a preference for energy flow from dark matter to dark energy, and hence negative dark energy densities. The only exceptions are $Q=3Hδρ_{\rm de}$ and $Q=3Hδ\left(\tfrac{ρ_{\rm de}^2}{ρ_{\rm dm}+ρ_{\rm de}}\right)$, which exhibit energy flow in the opposite direction. Furthermore, for all interactions considered, we find a phantom-divide crossing in the effective dark energy equation of state $w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}$, with the dark energy density decreasing ($w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}&gt;-1$) at present and at low redshift, while increasing ($w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}&lt;-1$) in the past at high redshift. These results highlight the promising, but problematic, nature of dark sector interactions, as well as the need to extend the analysis using early-time physics and datasets.</p>

<p>2026-01-06, <strong>Sommerfeld Effect and Bound State Formation for Dark Matter Models with Colored Mediators with SE+BSF4DM</strong>, Mathias Becker et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03026v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.03026v1</a></p>

<p>In the universal framework of simplified $t$-channel dark matter models, the calculation of the relic abundance can be dominated by mediator annihilation when the dark matter and mediator masses are almost degenerate. We analyze four representative models with scalar and fermionic mediators, confront them with direct detection limits and highlight the differences and common features between them. The mediator annihilations are considerably enhanced by the Sommerfeld effect and bound state formation. Albeit their effect is subdominant in the coannihilation regime, excited bound state levels are included as well. We find that Sommerfeld and bound-state effects can lead to order one corrections to the constraints on the DM mass in the coannihilating regime, with the precise magnitude depending on the specific model realization. In addition we provide SE+BSF4DM, an intuitive and easy to use add-on to micrOMEGAs, allowing for an automated inclusion of these effects for a generic $t$-channel Dark Matter Model, which is publicly available on Github.</p>

<p>2026-01-06, <strong>Two Higgs doublet model with a complex singlet scalar and Multi-critical Point Principle</strong>, Gi-Chol Cho et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02808v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.02808v1</a></p>

<p>We study a two Higgs doublet model extended by a complex singlet scalar, in which the imaginary part of the singlet serves as a dark matter (DM) candidate. In this model, degenerate masses of the three neutral Higgs bosons are crucial for achieving consistency with current constraints from DM direct-detection experiments and Higgs searches. This is called the degenerate scalar scenario. To provide a theoretical motivation for such a degenerate Higgs spectrum, we impose the tree-level Multiple Point Principle (MPP), which requires the electroweak and singlet vacua to be degenerate, and analyze its implications for the scalar potential, DM phenomenology, and the electroweak phase transition. We show that the tree-level MPP favors large SU(2)$_L$ doublet-singlet mixing parameters, which compete with the degenerate scalar scenario. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that viable parameter regions still exist in which the observed DM constraints are satisfied. Furthermore, although the tree-level MPP forbids a tree-level-driven first-order electroweak phase transition, we show that thermal loop effects can induce a strong first-order transition compatible with electroweak baryogenesis.</p>

<p>We explore the transition from the $Λ$CDM to an interacting dark sector by introducing a model with a redshift threshold that controls the onset of the energy transfer between the dark energy and the dark matter. Below the transition redshift, the interaction between dark matter and dark energy becomes active, while at earlier times the cosmological evolution coincides with that of $Λ$CDM. This approach allows us to determine the epoch in the comic history where the interacting effects have an impact in the description of the dark sector. We constrain the free parameters of the model using late-time cosmological observations, namely Cosmic Chronometers, DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Supernova data from the Pantheon Plus, Union3.0, and DES-Dovekie catalogues. The analysis provides an indication of a strong interacting term that describes energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter, which is activated at low redshifts. The PantheonPlus sample provides a threshold of $z_{T}&lt;0.624$, the Union3.0 sample yields $z_{T}=0.400_{-0.23}^{+0.021}$, and the DES-Dovekie sample gives $z_{T}=0.371_{-0.26}^{+0.028}$. The model fits the data in a similar way to the CPL parametrization, without the dark energy to cross the phantom divide line.</p>

<p>Subhalo spin is essential for modeling galaxy formation and controlling systematic uncertainties in intrinsic alignment (IA) studies. However, the physical mechanisms governing subhalo spin acquisition within the tidal environments of host halos remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the alignment between subhalo and host halo spins using the high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation, Shin-Uchuu. We find that the spin alignment between subhalos and host halos becomes increasingly pronounced toward the central regions. Our analysis reveals that subhalos typically acquire spin in the same direction as their orbital angular momentum. Since the orbital angular momentum of most subhalos is aligned with the host halo spin, an overall alignment between subhalo and host spins emerges. When classified by orbital orientation, however, subhalo spins in the inner regions are found to be oriented perpendicularly or anti-parallel to the host spin for polar and retrograde orbits, respectively. These results provide strong evidence that subhalo spins are acquired through torques exerted by the tidal field of the host halo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mass ratio and the radial distance from the host center are the primary parameters governing subhalo spin alignment, while the dependence on the accretion redshift is found to be negligible.</p>

<p>We present a proposal for a nanomechanical membrane resonator integrated into a moderate-finesse ($\mathcal{F}\sim 10$) optical cavity as a versatile platform for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves and vector dark matter. Gravitational-wave sensitivity arises from cavity-length modulation, which resonantly drives membrane motion via the radiation-pressure force. This force also enables in situ tuning of the membrane’s resonance frequency by nearly a factor of two, allowing a frequency coverage from 0.5 to 40 kHz using six membranes. The detector achieves a peak strain sensitivity of $2\times 10^{-23}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at 40 kHz. Using a silicon membrane positioned near a gallium-arsenide input mirror additionally provides sensitivity to vector dark matter via differential acceleration from their differing atomic-to-mass number ratios. The projected reach surpasses the existing limits in the range of $2\times 10^{-12}$ to $2\times 10^{-10}$ $\text{eV}/c^2$ for a one-year measurement. Consequently, the proposed detector offers a unified approach to searching for physics beyond the Standard Model, probing both high-frequency gravitational waves and vector dark matter.</p>

<p>Quantum device measurements are powerful tools to probe dark matter interactions. Among these, transmon qubits stand out for their ability to suppress external noise while remaining highly sensitive to tiny energy deposits. Ambient galactic halo dark matter interacting with electrons can deposit energy in the qubit, leading to changes in its decoherence time. Recent measurements of transmons have consistently measured, in various experimental setups, a residual contribution to the decoherence time unexplained by thermal noise or known external sources. We use such measurements to set the most stringent laboratory-based constraints to date on dark matter-electron scattering at the keV scale and competitive constraints on dark photon absorption.</p>

<p>Measuring the density profile and mass concentration of dark-matter haloes is a key test of the standard cold dark matter paradigm. Such objects are dark and thus challenging to characterise, but they can be studied via gravitational lensing. Recently, a million-solar-mass object was discovered superposed on an extended and extremely thin gravitational arc. Here we report on extensive tests of various assumptions for the mass density profile and redshift of this object. We find models that best describe the data have two components: an unresolved point-mass of radius $\leq10$ pc centred on an extended mass distribution with an almost constant surface density out to a truncation radius of 139 pc. These properties do not resemble any known astronomical object. However, if the object is dark matter-dominated, its structure is incompatible with cold dark matter models, but may be compatible with a self-interacting dark matter halo where the central region has collapsed to form a black hole. This detection could thus carry substantial implications for our current understanding of dark matter.</p>

<p>In a recent paper we pointed out that supermassive black holes, with masses ranging from $10^5$ to $10^{10} M_\odot$ form naturally at cosmic dawn if the dark matter is QCD axions or axion-like particles with mass $m &gt; 10^{-16}\, \mathrm{eV}/c^2$. No additional assumptions are required. Here we answer in detail the most commonly raised questions regarding our work.</p>

<p>Wave propagation in a coherently oscillating background is intrinsically a periodically driven problem. We show that photon propagation through an axion dark matter background in the presence of a magnetic field is governed by Floquet physics, distinct from conventional static or adiabatic mixing paradigms. Coherent photon-axion mode conversion occurs when the mismatch between the photon and axion dispersion relations is compensated by integer harmonics of the axion oscillation frequency, $Δ_γ- Δ_a \approx n m_a$ ($n \in \mathbb{Z}$) with the axion mass $m_a$, even far from the standard level-crossing condition $Δ_γ\approx Δ_a$. Crucially, this resonance disappears entirely if the axion oscillations are averaged over, and is therefore systematically missed in conventional static or adiabatic treatments. This driven resonance represents a unitary Floquet mode-mixing process and is fundamentally distinct from parametric instability or stimulated axion decay, preserving the axion dark matter number density. We develop a general Floquet framework for photon propagation in oscillating axion backgrounds, revealing that resonant mixing generates robust polarization effects during propagation. As an astrophysical application, we apply this mechanism to the realistic environment of the blazar 3C 279 to derive concrete constraints on the axion-photon coupling. While the observational manifestation depends on environmental conditions, the underlying driven mixing mechanism is generic to coherent axion dark matter, revealing a previously overlooked regime of photon-axion conversion.</p>

<p>We suggest a formation scenario of black holes with intermediate mass $\sim 10^3 M_\odot$, by post recombination Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion into ultra dense dark matter halos (UDMH) of $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$, which have formed around the recombination epoch. Such UDMH can result from rare curvature fluctuations on small scales whose amplitude is still well below the current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectral distortion limits. Gas accreted by the UDMH is heated to virial temperatures above which atomic cooling is efficient, cools rapidly to about $\sim 8000$ K and collapses on the free fall time of few $10^4$ yr to the halo core, until supported by rotation. Further fragmentation due to molecular cooling is prevented by the suppression of $H_2$ molecule formation by the CMB photons at redshifts $z&gt; 200-400$. We find that the rotationally supported gas disk will be compact and massive enough to undergo self-gravitational instability in some cases, plausibly where accretion is into a nearly spherical UDMH which has formed from a rare peak in the density field. This results in a further, rapid transfer of mass inwards due to viscous forces and gravitational torques leading to the formation of a supermassive star and/or black hole of about $10^3 M_\odot$ at redshifts of a few hundred, with abundances comparable to galaxies. Such intermediate mass black holes formed at high redshifts can seed the first super massive black holes and help explain the abundance of active galaxies detected now at increasingly larger redshifts by the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>

<p>Spatially extended Ly$α$ nebulae, known as Ly$α$ blobs (LABs), are a rare population at $z &gt; 2$ that are thought to trace proto-groups or the progenitors of massive galaxies in the present-day universe. However, their dark matter halo properties (e.g., halo mass) are still uncertain due to their rarity and strong field-to-field variation. The One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey has discovered 103 and 112 LABs in the extended ($\sim$9~\sqdeg) COSMOS field at $z\sim2.4$ and 3.1, respectively, enabling estimation of their bias and host halo masses through clustering analysis. We measure the angular auto-correlation functions (ACFs) of LABs and derive galaxy bias factors of $b$ = $4.0\pm0.8$ and $3.8\pm0.7$, corresponding to minimum halo masses of $2.8^{+3.0}_{-1.8}$ and $0.7^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\times10^{12}~M_\odot$ and median halo masses of $4.2^{+3.8}_{-2.5}$ and $1.1^{+1.1}_{-0.7}\times10^{12}~M_\odot$ at $z\sim2.4$ and 3.1, respectively. LABs occupy $\sim$11$^{+39}_{-8}$\% and $\sim$3$^{+9}_{-2}$\% of all dark matter halos above these minimum halo masses. These findings suggest that LABs inhabit massive dark matter halos, likely tracing proto-group environments that evolve into present-day massive halos ($\sim$10$^{13}~M_\odot$), where massive elliptical galaxies or galaxy groups reside, by $z=0$.</p>

<p>The increasing complexity and scale of cosmological N-body simulations, driven by astronomical surveys like Euclid, call for a paradigm shift towards more sustainable and energy-efficient high-performance computing (HPC). The rising energy consumption of supercomputing facilities poses a significant environmental and financial challenge.   In this work, we build upon a recently developed GPU implementation of pinocchio, a widely-used tool for the fast generation of dark matter (DM) halo catalogues, to investigate energy consumption. Using a different resource configuration, we confirmed the time-to-solution behavior observed in a companion study, and we use these runs to compare time-to-solution with energy-to-solution.   By profiling the code on various HPC platforms with a newly developed implementation of the Power Measurement Toolkit (PMT), we demonstrate an 8x reduction in energy-to-solution and 8x speed-up in time-to-solution compared to the CPU-only version. Taken together, these gains translate into an overall efficiency improvement of up to 64x. Our results show that the GPU-accelerated pinocchio not only achieves substantial speed-up, making the generation of large-scale mock catalogues more tractable, but also significantly reduces the energy footprint of the simulations. This work represents an step towards ``green-aware” scientific computing in cosmology, proving that performance and sustainability can be simultaneously achieved.</p>

<p>We present the deepest clustering analysis of early galaxies to date, analyzing $N_{\rm{g}} \simeq 6500$ photometrically-selected Lyman Break Galaxies from JWST’s Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to reveal how galaxies and dark matter evolved during cosmic dawn ($5 \leq z &lt; 11$). Using halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling of the two-point angular correlation function, we trace the galaxy-halo relationships across the first billion years of cosmic history. Our analysis reveals that galaxies at $z = 10.6$ reside in dark matter halos over an order of magnitude less massive ($M_{\rm{h}} \sim 10^{10.12} M_{\odot}$) than their counterparts at $z = 5.5$ ($M_{\rm{h}} \sim 10^{11.45} M_{\odot}$), while exhibiting correspondingly higher effective bias values ($b_{\rm{g}}^{\rm{eff}} = 8.13^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ compared to $5.64^{+0.10}_{-0.13}$). Correspondingly, the satellite galaxy fraction hints at a declining trend with decreasing redshift, reaching $&lt;1\%$ by $z \sim 5-6$. However, the significant systematic and random uncertainties in the data-model comparison prevent us from drawing robust conclusions on the evolution - if any - of the satellite fraction during the epoch of reionization. These results provide the first view of the coevolution between galaxies and dark matter evolved at redshift $\gtrsim 10$, offering additional and independent constraints on early galaxy formation models tuned to reproducing luminosity function evolution.</p>

<p>We present high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the newly identified supernova remnant (SNR) candidate G25.8+0.2 obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrograph (IGRINS) on the Harlan J. Smith Telescope. The source was originally discovered in the UKIRT Wide-field Infrared Survey for Fe+ (UWIFE; Lee et al. 2014). Our spectra reveal multiple kinematic components in the [Fe II] 1.644 um emission. The high-velocity components exhibit elevated [Fe II]/Br gamma ratios characteristic of shock excitation, while the low-velocity components are dominated by hydrogen and helium recombination lines and are consistent with photoionized gas, indicating an H II-region origin. G25.8+0.2 lies within the G26 complex, a large (~15’x 30’, corresponding to ~28 pc x 57 pc at a distance of 6.5 kpc) star-forming region in the inner Galaxy. The shock-excited [Fe II] filaments closely trace the morphology of the bright radio shell that partially encloses centrally filled soft X-ray emission, strongly suggesting recent supernova activity in this region. We discuss the physical nature of G25.8+0.2 and its relationship to the surrounding G26 star-forming complex. In addition, we derive the extinction toward the source using Brackett-line ratios and constrain the spectral types of the dominant ionizing stars from the He I 2.058 um/Br gamma line ratios.</p>

<p>We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024abfl, a low-luminosity Type IIP supernova (LLSN) discovered shortly after explosion. The transient reached a peak absolute magnitude of $M_V = -14.9$ and exhibited an extended, flat plateau lasting $\sim$125 days. From the late-time bolometric light curve, we estimate a $^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim0.01~M_\odot$, consistent with other LLSNe. Analytical shock-cooling models fail to reproduce the rapid early rise, indicating that circumstellar material (CSM) interaction contributed to the initial emission. The spectroscopic evolution is typical of LLSNe, with relatively narrow metal lines and low expansion velocities ($\lesssim 3000$ km s$^{-1}$) that decline slowly over time. We detect a broad ``ledge’’ feature around 4600 Åwithin three days of explosion, which we interpret as a blend of high-ionization shock-accelerated CSM lines. Multi-peaked H$α$ profiles develop during the plateau phase, consistent with complex ejecta-CSM interactions. As one of the best-observed examples of LLSNe, SN 2024abfl exhibits a weak explosion and signatures of nearby CSM, offering new insights into progenitor properties, pre-explosion mass loss, and the diversity of LLSNe.</p>

<p>Barrow and Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) are two recent extensions of the standard HDE framework, obtained by introducing generalized entropy corrections through the Barrow and Tsallis formalisms. In this work, we examine the cosmological consequences of Barrow and Tsallis HDE implemented with the Granda-Oliveros (GO) infrared (IR) cutoff. After deriving the modified Friedmann equations within the thermodynamic-gravity conjecture, we study the background evolution in both non-interacting and interacting dark sector scenarios, emphasizing the role of the entropic parameter in shaping late-time dynamics. We then confront the model with state-of-the-art observations, including PantheonPlus and Union3 Type Ia supernovae, Cosmic Chronometers and DESI DR2 BAO measurements. Using Bayesian MCMC methods, we constrain the model parameters and compare the performance of BHDE with that of $Λ$CDM. Our results show that BHDE is compatible with current data and can exhibit a mild statistical preference over the concordance model for certain dataset combinations. Overall, the analysis underscores the relevance of generalized entropy frameworks in late-time cosmology and identifies Barrow-Tsallis holography with the GO cutoff as a competitive alternative to $Λ$CDM.</p>

<p>The Lazuli Space Observatory is a 3-meter aperture astronomical facility designed for rapid-response observations and precision astrophysics across visible to near-infrared wavelengths (400-1700 nm bandpass). An off-axis, freeform telescope delivers diffraction-limited image quality (Strehl $&gt;$0.8 at 633 nm) to three instruments across a wide, flat focal plane. The three instruments provide complementary capabilities: a Wide-field Context Camera (WCC) delivers multi-band imaging over a 35’ $\times$ 12’ footprint with high-cadence photometry; an Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) provides continuous 400-1700 nm spectroscopy at R $\sim$ 100-500 for stable spectrophotometry; and an ExtraSolar Coronagraph (ESC) enables high-contrast imaging expected to reach raw contrasts of $10^{-8}$ and post-processed contrasts approaching $10^{-9}$. Operating from a 3:1 lunar-resonant orbit, Lazuli will respond to targets of opportunity in under four hours–a programmatic requirement designed to enable routine temporal responsiveness that is unprecedented for a space telescope of this size. Lazuli’s technical capabilities are shaped around three broad science areas: (1) time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, (2) stars and planets, and (3) cosmology. These capabilities enable a potent mix of science spanning gravitational wave counterpart characterization, fast-evolving transients, Type Ia supernova cosmology, high-contrast exoplanet imaging, and spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres. While these areas guide the observatory design, Lazuli is conceived as a general-purpose facility capable of supporting a wide range of astrophysical investigations, with open time for the global community. We describe the observatory architecture and capabilities in the preliminary design phase, with science operations anticipated following a rapid development cycle from concept to launch.</p>

<p>One of the Milky Way’s characteristic features is a strongly bimodal distribution of $α$-process elements, such as Mg, at fixed [Fe/H] in stellar abundances. We examine patterns in [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] in FIRE-2 simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. Out of 16 galaxies, 4 are capable of producing a strongly bimodal distribution. In all four galaxies, the high-$α$ population corresponds to an older, radially-compact, thick disk, and the low-$α$ population corresponds to a younger, radially-extended, thin disk, similar to the MW.The transition from high- to low-$α$ took $0.3-1.2\Gyr$ and began $5.5-6.5\Gyr$ ago. [Mg/Fe] decreased at relatively fixed [Fe/H], both in the galaxy overall and at fixed radii: Fe enrichment nearly balanced gas accretion (and therefore dilution), but Mg enrichment was weaker. Importantly, this transition occurred during a period of relatively low gas fraction ($5-15\%$), immediately after a rapid decline in star formation (halving within a few hundred Myr), which caused an increase in Fe-producing white-dwarf supernovae relative to Mg-producing core-collapse supernovae. Only one case coincided with a major merger coalescence. We find similar trends in measuring stars by their current radius and by their birth radius, therefore, radial redistribution did not play a dominant role in the formation of a bimodality or its spatial dependence today. Overall, in FIRE-2, strong $α$-element bimodalities are relatively uncommon ($\sim25\%$), often not associated with a major merger, and arise primarily from a rapid decline in star formation during relatively low gas fraction.</p>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has spectroscopically confirmed galaxies up to $z\sim14$, 300 Myr after the Big Bang, and several candidates have been discovered at $z\sim15-25$, with one candidate as high as $z\sim30$, only 100 Myr after the Big Bang. Such objects are unexpected, since theoretical studies have not predicted the existence of detectable galaxies at $z\sim30$. While any $z\sim30$ candidates may be contaminants at lower redshifts, we explore whether such extreme redshift sources could be consistent with hyper-energetic transient events linked to the formation of the first, metal-free, stars. Specifically, we consider pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), a predicted class of extreme thermonuclear explosions that leave no remnant behind. Using cosmological simulations, we investigate an overdense cosmic region, where star formation and subsequent PISNe occur at $z\sim30-40$, even within standard cosmology. Assessing the likelihood of such a region, the corresponding number of PISNe at $z\gtrsim20$, and their observed flux, we find that JWST has a non-negligible chance to detect a PISN event at extremely high redshifts. If a transient event were confirmed at $z\sim30$, this would provide a direct glimpse into the epoch of first star formation, dramatically extending the empirical reach of astronomy.</p>

<p>We perform a comprehensive search for high-velocity X-ray sources with large X-ray/optical flux ratios ($F_\mathrm{X}/F_\mathrm{G}$), identifying candidates for interacting black hole or neutron star binaries potentially accelerated by supernova natal kicks. We cross-match X-ray points sources from a variety of catalogues (Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift and eROSITA) with Gaia DR3. Using Gaia coordinates, parallaxes, and proper motions, we compute peculiar velocities ($\upsilon_\mathrm{pec}$) relative to Galactic disc rotation. Remaining agnostic about radial velocities (RVs), we vary RVs to find the minimum possible $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec}$ values ($\upsilon_\mathrm{pec, min}$). Uncertainties on $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec, min}$ are estimated via Monte Carlo resampling, and we select X-ray sources that have $1\,σ$ lower limits on $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec, min}\geq 200\,\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ and high $F_\mathrm{X}/F_\mathrm{G}$ values. We show that this velocity threshold excludes most contaminants (e.g., cataclysmic variables and active binaries) while retaining a sensible fraction of compact object binaries, demonstrating that $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec}$ could serve as an effective indicator for the presence of a neutron star or black hole companion. Our selection yields a sample of 2372 sources, from which we construct a gold sample of 7 sources that have relatively well-constrained astrometry and confident optical counterparts. Follow-up is necessary to confirm and characterise their high-energy emission, as well as a Galactic disc vs. halo origin.</p>

<p>We study the late-time cosmological dynamics of a two-field dark energy model consisting of a canonical quintessence scalar field and a phantom scalar field in a spatially flat FLRW universe. The fields are minimally coupled to gravity and uncoupled at the level of the potential, with the quintessence sector governed by an exponential potential and the phantom sector by an inverse power-law potential. By reformulating the background equations as a five-dimensional autonomous dynamical system, we identify and analyze the fixed points and their stability properties, revealing stable late-time attractors corresponding to phantom-dominated accelerated expansion. We confront the model with observations through a Bayesian parameter estimation performed using the \textsc{Cobaya} framework, employing several combinations of recent cosmological data sets, including Pantheon+ supernovae, compressed cosmic microwave background distance priors, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and DES Year-5 supernova data. The observational constraints favor a dynamical dark energy sector moderately and are consistent with deviations from a cosmological constant at the present epoch. The regions of parameter space preferred by the data are compatible with the stable accelerating solutions identified in the dynamical analysis, establishing a direct connection between phase-space stability and observational viability. A notable feature of the model is that the effective dark energy equation of state undergoes phantom divide crossing in a gradual and asymptotic manner, rather than as a sharp transition.</p>

<p>2026-01-05, <strong>The JWST EXCELS survey: Outflows in 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 5 quiescent galaxies are likely relics from episodic AGN activity</strong>, Elizabeth Taylor et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02269v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.02269v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the presence and origin of neutral gas outflows and inflows in 13 post-starburst (PSB) and quiescent galaxies at redshifts 1.8 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 4.6, using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from the EXCELS survey. NaD absorption profiles reveal that 3 out of 13 exhibit blueshifted absorption indicative of outflows, and a further 2 objects show signs of inflowing gas. Outflow velocities range from $\approx$ 300 - 1200 kms$^{-1}$, and we find gas flows are detected exclusively in objects that quenched $\lt$ 600 Myr ago. This result holds when we include comparable objects from recent literature. We derive mass outflow rates over two orders of magnitude higher than current levels of star formation in our sample, indicating that the winds are unlikely to be driven by supernovae, and likely play a significant role in keeping the galaxies quenched. The majority of the outflow sample have anomalously high energy and momentum outflow rates compared to those predicted for current levels of star formation or AGN activity. We conclude that we are likely observing fossil outflows driven by previous, more luminous AGN activity which has since faded. We then compare with the EAGLE simulation to explore a potential ‘outflow cycle’, finding that our observations are consistent with a model in which z $\sim$ 3 quiescent galaxies undergo short $\simeq$ 5 Myr periods of AGN activity strong enough to drive outflows, which occur every $\simeq$ 40 Myr on average. This AGN activity drives observable outflows that persist for up to $\simeq$ 10 Myr after the AGN fades, followed by a $\simeq$ 20 Myr lull, and a subsequent short inflow, which eventually re-ignites AGN activity, and the cycle repeats.</p>

<p>2026-01-05, <strong>A phoenix rises from the ashes: WOH G64 is still a red supergiant, for now</strong>, Jacco Th. van Loon et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02057v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.02057v1</a></p>

<p>For a long time, WOH G64 was known as the most extreme red supergiant outside our Galaxy. However, in a matter of years it has faded, its pulsations have become suppressed and the spectrum has become dominated by emission lines from ionised gas, a far cry from the Mira-like pulsation and late M-type spectrum it used to display. Around the same time, a hot dust cloud was discovered using the VLT interferometer. WOH G64 has been claimed to have turned into a yellow hypergiant, which could signal a pre-supernova post-red supergiant evolution. Here we present spectra of WOH G64 obtained with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) between November 2024 and December 2025. Molecular absorption bands from TiO are seen at all times. This implies that WOH G64 is currently a red supergiant, and may never have ceased to be. However, the shallow, resolved bands and possible detection of VO hint at a highly extended atmosphere. The continuum appears to be varying, while the line emission shows a different behaviour, suggesting two separate components in the system. Meanwhile, atomic absorption lines are deepening. This places important constraints on scenarios for the dramatic events that are unfolding.</p>

<p>2026-01-05, <strong>The Betelgeuse Enigma: The Betelbuddy Hypothesis</strong>, Priya Hasan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02012v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.02012v2</a></p>

<p>In the past six years, Betelgeuse has been in the news and drawn significant public interest. Starting in October 2019, Betelgeuse underwent a striking dimming event, fading from magnitude 0.5 to 1.7 by mid February 2020 a threefold decrease in brightness This gave rise to a number of speculative debates that the star was on the verge of a supernova, a moment of eerie quiet before the cosmic outburst. In a previous article, the author discussed the most accepted explanation to the dimming caused by episodic mass loss that released large dust grains, which obscured Betelgeuse’s light and made it appear fainter. This interpretation suggested that the dimming was not a precursor to a supernova, as Betelgeuse is likely still far from reaching that stage.   On 21 July 2025, the existence of the companion star was confirmed with direct imaging, for the first time, by the alopeke instrument on the 8.1 m Gemini North telescope. The companion is 6 magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse and orbits close to Betelgeuse itself, within the supergiant star’s extended outer atmosphere. The stellar companion was detected at an angular separation of 52 mas and a position angle of 115 deg east of north. These measurements, along with its brightness, being roughly 6 magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse at 466 nm, are in excellent agreement with dynamical predictions. Although this was only a 1.5 sigma detection, the agreement in the companion’s appearance, separation, position angle, magnitude difference, and estimated mass is reasonable, making the result tentatively acceptable. The next optimum period for observations is November 2027, when we hope to get better observations. This article describes the interesting twists and turns of this study and what lies in the future for Betelgeuse and its companion, Betelbuddy or Siwarha.</p>

<p>2026-01-05, <strong>Extended Ionized Fe Objects in the UWIFE Survey</strong>, Kim Yesol et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01812v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.01812v1</a></p>

<p>We explore systematically the shocked gas in the first Galactic quadrant of the Milky Way using the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Wide-field Infrared Survey for Fe+ (UWIFE). The UWIFE survey is the first imaging survey of the Milky Way in the [Fe II] 1.644 um emission line and covers the Galactic plane in the first Galactic quadrant (7 deg &lt; l &lt; 62 deg; |b| &lt; 1.5 deg). We identify 204 extended ionized Fe objects (IFOs) using a combination of a manual and automatic search. Most of the IFOs are detected for the first time in the [Fe II] 1.644 um line. We present a catalog of the measured sizes and fluxes of the IFOs and searched for their counterparts by performing positional cross-matching with known sources. We found that IFOs are associated with supernova remnants (25), young stellar objects (100), H II regions (33), planetary nebulae (17), and luminous blue variables (4). The statistical and morphological properties are discussed for each of these.</p>

<p>2026-01-05, <strong>Light curve modeling of the nearest neutron star candidate LAMOST J235456.73+335625.9</strong>, Qing-bo Han et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01755v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.01755v1</a></p>

<p>The discovery of heavy radioactive elements (e.g., $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$) on Earth suggests that supernova explosions may have occurred near our planet within the past million years, potentially having a significant impact on the ecological environment. This finding has motivated the search for nearby neutron stars in the Solar neighborhood. In a recent study, a candidate for one of the closest neutron stars to Earth, LAMOST J235456.73+335625.9 (hereafter J2354), was reported. Based on dynamical mass measurements under different inclination angle assumptions, the inferred mass range for the unseen compact companion in the system is $1.4$–$1.6$ $M_{\odot}$. Hence, the unseen companion in J2354 is either a massive cold white dwarf or a neutron star. Here we model the flux variations of J2354 as a combination of ellipsoidal modulation and surface spots. We test both cold spot and hot spot models, setting the number of spots to two in each case, and constrain the spot properties through light curve fitting. In the cold spot scenario, the spots are mostly visible at phases $0.5$–$0.75$, whereas in the hot spot scenario, the spots appear predominantly at phases $0.25$–$0.5$. The hot spot model shows better agreement with the observed H$α$ phase variation than the cold spot model. Furthermore, the thermal radiation of a massive but cold white dwarf cannot produce the level of localized heating required to explain the hot spot unless additional heating mechanisms are involved; in contrast, a neutron star can naturally provide such heating through energetic winds. Our results are consistent with the neutron star interpretation of the compact object in J2354.</p>
