<p>2025-07-28, <strong>Charged current neutrino and antineutrino induced associated particle production from nucleons</strong>, A. Fatima et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20754v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.20754v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we study the charged-current (anti)neutrino-induced associated particle($K\Lambda$) production($\Delta S=0$) from free nucleons in the energy region of a few GeV, relevant to the (anti)neutrino oscillation experiments with accelerator and atmospheric neutrinos. We employ a model based on effective Lagrangians to evaluate the contributions from the nonresonant and the resonant diagrams. The nonresonant background terms are calculated using a microscopic model derived from the SU(3) chiral Lagrangians. For the resonant contributions, we consider the low-lying spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ resonances, such as $S_{11}(1650)$, $P_{11}(1710)$, $P_{11}(1880)$, and $S_{11}(1895)$, and spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ resonances, such as $P_{13}(1720)$ and $P_{13}(1900)$, which have finite branching ratios to the $K\Lambda$ channel. These resonant contributions are modelled using an effective phenomenological Lagrangian approach, with strong couplings determined from the experimental branching ratios and the decay widths to the $K\Lambda$ channel. To fix the parameters of the vector current interaction, the model is first used to reproduce satisfactorily the MAMI experimental data on the real photon induced scattering off the nucleon resulting an eta meson in the final state and with the CLAS data for the $K\Lambda$ production in the final state. The PCAC hypothesis and the generalized Goldberger-Treiman relation are used to fix the parameters of the axial vector interaction. The model is then applied to study the weak production of $K\Lambda$ induced by the neutrinos and antineutrinos, and predicts the numerical values for the $Q^2$-distribution, the kaon kinetic energy distribution, and the total scattering cross sections with and without a cut on the CM energy W. The results presented in this work are relevant for the present and future accelerator and atmospheric neutrino experiments.</p>

<p>Large lepton flavor asymmetries with zero total lepton asymmetry could be generated in the Early Universe. They are loosely constrained by current observations, being washed out at MeV temperatures by neutrino oscillations. We show that such lepton flavor asymmetries open up a new parameter space for sterile neutrino dark matter, consistent with all observational bounds. To this end, we construct the semi-classical Boltzmann equation for sterile neutrinos applicable in the case of arbitrarily large lepton asymmetries, and confirm its validity by quantum kinetic equations. This way, we derive the maximal parameter space for sterile neutrino dark matter with lepton asymmetries. The allowed range of sterile neutrinos’ squared couplings extends by up to two orders of magnitude across a 5-70 keV mass range, and may be testable by X-ray, structure formation, and upcoming CMB observations.</p>

<p>2025-07-28, <strong>Understanding neutrino pion production with the GiBUU model</strong>, Qiyu Yan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20539v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.20539v1</a></p>

<p>Pion production is a major source of systematic uncertainty in neutrino oscillation measurements. We report a systematic investigation of neutrino-induced pion production using MINERvA and MicroBooNE data within the GiBUU theoretical framework. The analysis begins by establishing baseline model parameters using inclusive and pionless data from MINERvA, MicroBooNE, and T2K experiments. We then examine the role of in-medium effects, including resonance broadening and nucleon-nucleon final-state interactions. While agreement with individual datasets can be achieved through specific model configurations, we demonstrate the difficulty of a unified description across all experiments: MINERvA measurements prefer minimum in-medium modifications, whereas MicroBooNE data require the maximum in-medium enhancement, revealing the complexity and richness of the underlying nuclear dynamics.</p>

<p>2025-07-27, <strong>Future Parameter Constraints from Weak Lensing CMB and Galaxy Lensing Power- and Bispectra</strong>, Jonas Frugte et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20262v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.20262v1</a></p>

<p>Upcoming stage 4 surveys, such as the Simons Observatory, LSST, and Euclid, are poised to measure weak gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and galaxies with unprecedented precision. While the power spectrum is the standard statistic used to analyze weak lensing data, non-Gaussianity from non-linear structure growth encodes additional cosmological information in higher-order statistics. We forecast the ability of future surveys to constrain cosmological parameters using the weak lensing power spectrum and bispectrum from both CMB and galaxy surveys, including their cross-correlations. We consider an eight-parameter model ($\Lambda$CDM + $\sum m_\nu$ + $w_0$) and assess constraints for stage 4 survey specifications. In the absence of systematics, both the CMB and galaxy lensing bispectra are found to be detectable at high signal-to-noise. We test two priors: a ‘‘strong’’ one based on constraints from CMB temperature and $E$-mode polarization anisotropies, and a ‘‘weak’’ one with minimal assumptions. With the weak prior, the bispectrum significantly improves parameter constraints by breaking degeneracies. For strong priors, improvements are more limited, especially for the CMB bispectrum. On small scales, where non-linear effects dominate, the bispectrum’s constraining power can rival that of the power spectrum. We also find strong synergy between CMB and galaxy lensing; combining both probes leads to tighter constraints, particularly on neutrino mass. It was recently found that the CMB lensing bispectrum is strongly affected by the Born approximation, so we also consider post-Born corrections but find that our main conclusions remain the same. These results highlight the potential of higher-order lensing statistics and motivate further work on neglected effects such as non-Gaussian covariance, instrumental systematics, and baryonic feedback.</p>

<p>2025-07-27, <strong>Meson-Exchange Currents in Quasielastic CC Neutrino Reactions with Single-Nucleon Knockout</strong>, P. R. Casale et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20246v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.20246v1</a></p>

<p>The effect of meson-exchange currents on charged-current quasielastic neutrino scattering with single-nucleon emission is computed and analyzed within the relativistic Fermi gas model. This contribution arises primarily from the interference between one-body and two-body currents, where the two-body operator excites a 1p1h state in the presence of a second, spectator nucleon. The results obtained show a reduction of the vector, axial and vector-axial transverse response functions and, consequently, a decrease in the total neutrino cross section. In addition to a comparison with the non-relativistic limit, other models are also explored, such as the relativistic mean field model for nuclear matter and the superscaling analysis with relativistic effective mass, both of which yield qualitatively similar results.</p>

<p>2025-07-27, <strong>Directional Neutrino Bursts from Spinning and Moving Primordial Black Holes</strong>, Arnab Chaudhuri et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20207v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.20207v1</a></p>

<p>We show that primordial black holes (PBHs) with significant spin and bulk motion produce sharply collimated neutrino bursts from Hawking evaporation, arising from the interplay of spin-induced angular anisotropy and relativistic Doppler boosting. This effect shifts the neutrino spectrum into the multi-GeV to hundreds of GeV range, where atmospheric backgrounds drop steeply, and enhances the flux by orders of magnitude within a narrow forward cone. We compute the full lab-frame neutrino distribution and derive updated constraints on PBH number density from non-observation of such bursts in IceCube and KM3NeT. Our results identify directional high-energy neutrino bursts as a distinctive, testable signature of spinning PBHs, providing a complementary probe of the PBH dark matter hypothesis and Hawking radiation.</p>

<p>2025-07-28, <strong>Primordial Black Hole Triggered Type Ia Supernovae I: Impact on Explosion Dynamics and Light Curves</strong>, Shing-Chi Leung et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21041v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.21041v1</a></p>

<p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass window are compelling dark matter candidates, made plausible by the existence of black holes and by the variety of mechanisms of their production in the early universe. If a PBH falls into a white dwarf (WD), the strong tidal forces can generate enough heat to trigger a thermonuclear runaway explosion, depending on the WD mass and the PBH orbital parameters. In this work, we investigate the WD explosion triggered by the passage of PBH. We perform 2D simulations of the WD undergoing thermonuclear explosion in this scenario, with the predicted ignition site as the parameter assuming the deflagration-detonation transition model. We study the explosion dynamics and predict the associated light curves and nucleosynthesis. We find that the model sequence predicts the light curves which align with the Phillip’s relation ($B_{\max}$ vs. $\Delta M_{15}$). Our models hint at a unifying approach in triggering Type Ia supernovae without involving two distinctive evolutionary tracks.</p>

<p>2025-07-28, <strong>Probing the axion-electron coupling at cavity experiments</strong>, Deog Ki Hong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20830v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.20830v1</a></p>

<p>Axion dark matter induces electromagnetic radiation in conductors through nearly perpetual oscillations of electrons, driven by axion-electron interactions through the so-called chiral magnetic effect. It therefore provides a complementary probe of the axion-electron coupling $g_{ae}$ beyond the conventional axion-photon coupling $g_{a \gamma}$ in cavities. We show that existing axion cavity experiments can constrain the coupling to $g_{ae}\lesssim 10^{-5}$ over the scanned axion mass ranges, $1\,\mu\, {\rm eV}\lesssim m_a\lesssim 20\,\mu\,{\rm eV}$. Although we find that the radiation due to $g_{ae}$ at the copper cavity surface of electric conductivity $\sigma$ is suppressed by $m_a^2/\sigma^2\sim 10^{-20}$, compared to the radiation inside the cavity by the axion-photon conversion due to $g_{a\gamma}$, a sensitivity of about $10^{-9}$ could be achieved for $g_{ae}$ over a wider range of $m_a$, including values higher than those previously probed, if copper walls are replaced with carbon-based conductors.</p>

<p>2025-07-28, <strong>Rotating Proto-Neutron Stars Admixed with Mirror Dark Matter: A two fluid approach</strong>, Adamu Issifu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20823v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.20823v1</a></p>

<p>This work investigates the impact of mirror dark matter (DM) on the global properties of rotating neutron stars (NSs) across evolutionary stages, from hot, lepton-rich proto-neutron stars (PNSs) to cold, catalyzed NSs along the Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale. The baryonic matter (BM) is modeled using a relativistic mean-field (RMF) approach with density-dependent couplings, while the dark sector mirrors the visible sector with analogous thermodynamic conditions. Using a two-fluid formalism with purely gravitational DM-BM interaction, we find that rotation enlarges the star, whereas DM admixture increases compactness and enhances gravitational stability. However, increased compactness due to DM lowers the threshold for rotational instabilities, making DM-admixed stars more susceptible. Rotation decreases temperature profiles by redistributing thermal energy over a larger volume and reducing central density, while DM raises temperatures by deepening the gravitational potential and increasing thermal energy. Stars become more prone to collapse and rotational instabilities as frequency ($\nu$) rises and the polar-to-equatorial radius ratio ($r_p/r_e$) decreases, especially near the Keplerian limit ($\nu_K$). DM-admixed stars also show higher surface gravitational redshifts due to their compactness. Our results qualitatively agree with universal relations primarily derived for rotating cold stars. These findings highlight competing effects of rotation and DM on NS thermal evolution, structure, and observables, potentially offering indirect probes of DM within NSs.</p>

<p>2025-07-28, <strong>Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS): Satellite Quenching at Intermediate Redshift</strong>, L. J. M. Davies et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20822v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.20822v1</a></p>

<p>Determining the processes by which galaxies transition from a star-forming to a quiescent state (quenching) is paramount to our understanding of galaxy evolution. One of the key mechanisms by which this takes place is via a galaxy’s interactions with a local, over-dense environment (satellite or environmental quenching). In the very local Universe, we see these processes in action, and can also observe their effects via the distribution of satellite galaxy properties. However, extending similar analyses outside of the local Universe is problematic, largely due to the difficulties in robustly defining environments with small and/or incomplete spectroscopic samples. We use new environmental metrics from the high-completeness Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) to explore the properties of satellite galaxies at intermediate redshift (0.3$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.5) and compare directly to the Galaxy And Mass Assembly Survey (GAMA) at 0$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.2. Importantly, both the galaxy properties and environmental metrics in DEVILS and GAMA are derived in an identical manner, reducing any methodology biases. We find: i) that satellite galaxies in DEVILS and GAMA show suppressed star-formation in comparison to isolated systems at the same stellar mass, by $\sim$0.5dex in log$_{10}$(SFR/M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), ii) that this suppression is strongest in higher mass dark matter halos (up to $\sim$1dex in log$_{10}$(SFR/M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) in the most massive halos) and iii) that at fixed stellar and halo mass, this suppression increases with time - with satellite passive fractions increasing by $\sim$10-15\% over the last $\sim$5Gyr. This is consistent with previous observations and numerical simulations.</p>

<p>2025-07-28, <strong>Beyond Extreme Burstiness: Evolving Star Formation Efficiency as the Key to Early Galaxy Abundance</strong>, Abhijnan Kar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20606v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.20606v1</a></p>

<p>JWST observations have revealed an overabundance of bright galaxies at $z \geq 9$, creating apparent tensions with theoretical predictions within standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We address this challenge using a semi-empirical approach that connects dark matter halos to observed UV luminosity through physically motivated double power-law star formation efficiency (SFE) model as a function of halo mass, redshift and perform joint Bayesian analysis of luminosity functions spanning $z = 4 - 16$ using combined HST and JWST data. Through systematic model comparison using information criteria (AIC, BIC, DIC), we identify the optimal framework requiring redshift evolution only in the low-mass slope parameter $\alpha(z)$ while maintaining other SFE parameters constant. Our best-fitting model achieves excellent agreement with observations using modest, constant UV scatter $\sigma_{\rm UV} = 0.32$ dex, significantly lower than the $\gtrsim 1.3$ dex values suggested by previous studies for $z &gt; 13$. This reduced scatter requirement is compensated by strongly evolving star formation efficiency, with $\alpha$ increasing toward higher redshifts, indicating enhanced star formation in low-mass halos during cosmic dawn. The model also successfully reproduces another important observational diagnostic such as effective galaxy bias across the full redshift range. Furthermore, model predictions are consistent up to a redshift of $z\sim 20$. Our results demonstrate that JWST’s early galaxy observations can be reconciled with standard cosmology through the interplay of modest stochasticity and evolving star formation physics, without invoking extreme burstiness or exotic mechanisms.</p>

<p>2025-07-28, <strong>Dark photon dark matter from flattened axion potentials</strong>, Hong-Yi Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20484v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.20484v1</a></p>

<p>Dark photons can be resonantly produced in the early universe via their coupling to an oscillating axion field. However, this mechanism typically requires large axion-dark photon couplings or some degree of fine-tuning. In this work, we present a new scenario in which efficient dark photon production arises from axion potentials that are shallower than quadratic at large field values. For moderately large initial misalignment angles, the oscillation of the axion field can trigger either efficient dark photon production or strong axion self-resonance via parametric resonance. When self-resonance dominates and disrupts the field’s homogeneity, we show that oscillons – localized, oscillating axion field configurations – naturally form and can sustain continued dark photon production, provided the coupling is $\gtrsim \mathcal O(1)$. For dark photon mass up to three orders of magnitude below the axion mass, the produced dark photons can account for a significant fraction of the present-day dark matter. We support this scenario with numerical lattice simulations of a benchmark model. Our results further motivate experimental searches for ultralight dark photon dark matter. The simulation code is publicly available at https://github.com/hongyi18/AxionDarkPhotonSimulator.</p>

<p>2025-07-28, <strong>Superhorizon fluctuations and the cosmic dipole problem</strong>, Ge Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20462v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.20462v1</a></p>

<p>Recent observations have identified a significant 4.9$\sigma$ tension between the cosmic dipole inferred from galaxy number counts and that derived from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), suggesting a potential deviation from the cosmological principle. This work investigates whether superhorizon isocurvature perturbations in cold dark matter (CDM) can account for this discrepancy. We demonstrate that, unlike adiabatic modes which cancel at leading order, superhorizon isocurvature modes can generate an intrinsic CMB dipole without significantly affecting galaxy number counts, thereby explaining the observed mismatch. We explore both single-mode and continuous-spectrum cases, focusing on two concrete models: a nearly scale-invariant power-law spectrum with a UV cutoff and axion-induced isocurvature perturbations. For the axion scenario, we show that if the radial mode evolves during inflation, the resulting perturbations can match the required amplitude while evading current CMB constraints. Our analysis constrains the self-coupling of associated potential for the axion to the range $10^{-9} &lt; \lambda &lt; 4 \times 10^{-9}$. These findings offer a viable solution to the dipole tension and may serve as indirect evidence for axion dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-07-27, <strong>Fuzzy dark matter soliton as gravitational lens</strong>, Ke Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20323v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.20323v1</a></p>

<p>The Schr"odinger-Poisson (SP) equations predict fuzzy dark matter (FDM) solitons. Given the FDM mass $\sim10^{-20}\rm~{eV}/c^2$, the FDM soliton in the Milky Way is massive $\sim 10^7~M_{\odot}$ but diffuse $\sim 10{\rm~pc}$. Therefore, this FDM soliton can serve as a gravitational lens for gravitational waves (GWs) with frequency $\sim10^{-8}{\rm~Hz}$. In this paper, we investigate its gravitational lensing effects by numerical simulation of the propagation of GWs through it. We find that the maximum magnification factor of GWs is very small $\sim10^{-4}$, but the corresponding magnification zone is huge $\sim6{\rm~pc}$ for FDM with mass equal to $8^{-21}\rm~{eV}/c^2$. Consequently, this small magnification factor in that large magnification zone means a small antisotropy of $\sim10^{-4}$ over a large solid angle in the GW background, even though this antisotropy is out of the sensitivity of the pulsar timing arrays today.</p>

<p>Multi-messenger astronomy was galvanized by the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and electromagnetic (EM) emission from the subsequent kilonova and short gamma ray burst. Maximizing multi-messenger constraints on these systems requires combining models of the progenitors and products of BNS mergers within a single framework in anticipation of future GW and EM detectors. We demonstrate how combining models of different aspects of the BNS progenitor-merger-remnant system into a full multi-messenger modeling pipeline reveals insight into modeling challenges that will need to be addressed in the coming decade of multi-messenger astronomy. Motivated by GW170817, this combined model relates the progenitor astrophysics of a BNS population with their GW observability and localizability, kilonova light curves, gamma-ray burst afterglow flux, and kilonova remnant evolution. We find joint correlations between the GW and EM observables that depend on a complicated interplay between modeling assumptions and theoretical uncertainties. Next generation detectors will generically provide multi-messenger constraints on BNSs with median GW network signal-to-noise ratio $\approx 10$, median of the 90$^{\rm th}$ percentile sky area $\approx 10$ sq. deg., and kilonova $i$-band apparent magnitudes ranging from $\approx 33$ to $23$. We find no more than 4\% of the BNSs are simultaneously detectable by a network of two Cosmic Explorers and one Einstein Telescope and by the Roman and Rubin telescopes for 55 and 180 sec. exposures in a $K$-like band and $i$ and $g$ bands, respectively. We discuss key modeling assumptions that will be transmitted as multi-messenger systematics in the analysis of future datasets, such as uncertain astrophysical processes of binary populations and the nuclear equation of state for tests of nuclear physics and dark matter.</p>

<p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass window are compelling dark matter candidates, made plausible by the existence of black holes and by the variety of mechanisms of their production in the early universe. If a PBH falls into a white dwarf (WD), the strong tidal forces can generate enough heat to trigger a thermonuclear runaway explosion, depending on the WD mass and the PBH orbital parameters. In this work, we investigate the WD explosion triggered by the passage of PBH. We perform 2D simulations of the WD undergoing thermonuclear explosion in this scenario, with the predicted ignition site as the parameter assuming the deflagration-detonation transition model. We study the explosion dynamics and predict the associated light curves and nucleosynthesis. We find that the model sequence predicts the light curves which align with the Phillip’s relation ($B_{\max}$ vs. $\Delta M_{15}$). Our models hint at a unifying approach in triggering Type Ia supernovae without involving two distinctive evolutionary tracks.</p>

<p>Chemical abundance measurements from stars in the Milky Way to the intragalactic medium in the Perseus Cluster have challenged the spherical explosion models. Models in the literature cannot closely match the observed element ratios, where Si, S are overproduced and Ar, Ca are underproduced. In this article, we explore the impact of the model parameters during the evolution of massive stars on the final explosive nucleosynthesis. We investigate the effects of a parametrized model of the convective process, including the mixing length parameter and the semi-convection parameter, on the production of Si-group elements. We search for the value pair that can reduce the discrepancy in the models. We conclude that a mixing length parameter of 2.2 and semi-convection parameter of 0.03 are required to fit these criteria. Using this updated value pair, we compute a sequence of massive star models from $M_{\rm ZAMS} = $ 15 – 40 $M_{\odot}$. The high resolution data from future observations such as XRISM will provide further details on less constrained processes in stellar evolution and supernova explosion. Future comparison with supernova models of various progenitor metallicity will further shed light on the supernova population and their relative rates on cosmological scales.</p>

<p>The parameter space for mass loss in Type Ia supernova progenitors is large, with different progenitor scenarios favoring different mass loss regimes. Here we focus on the impact that uniform and isotropic outflows have on the circumstellar environment of Type Ia supernova progenitors. We vary mass loss rate, wind velocity, and outflow duration, and evolve supernova remnant (SNR) models in this grid of circumstellar structures in order to compare the bulk properties of these models (ages, radii, and \feka\ centroids and luminosities) to observations. We find that roughly 50\% of young Type Ia SNRs in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud had progenitors that did not substantially modify their surroundings on $\sim$pc scales. This group includes SN Ia with a range of luminosities, and at least some likely products of double detonation explosions in sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs. The other half of our sample can be divided in two distinct classes. A small subset of SNRs ($\sim$15\%) have large radii and low \feka\ centroids and are likely expanding into large cavities excavated by fast ($\sim$1000 km/s), sustained progenitor outflows. The majority of the SNRs that are expanding into a modified medium ($\sim35\%$) show evidence for dense material, likely associated with slow ($\sim$10 km/s) progenitor outflows, possibly a byproduct of accretion processes in near-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs spawned by younger stellar populations.</p>

<p>Supernovae (SNe) associated with X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) are extremely rare. Therefore, the discovery of each new object in this class offers a unique opportunity to improve our understanding about their origins and potential connection with other high-energy phenomena. SN 2025kg is one of the most recent events discovered in this category, and exhibits a double-peaked light curve, with an initial cooling phase followed by the main peak. Here, we investigate the possible mechanisms powering its bolometric light curve and expansion velocities, using numerical calculations to simulate the explosion. We found that low ejecta masses (Mej ~ 2 Msun) and moderate explosion energies (E ~ 2e51 erg) are required to reproduce the data. Our models also show that a large amount of nickel (M_Ni = 0.85 Msun) is needed to achieve the high luminosity of SN 2025kg, which makes this scenario difficult to sustain. As an alternative, we explore a model in which a millisecond magnetar serves as the primary energy source. A magnetar with a spin period of 3 ms, approximately, and a magnetic field of 28e14 G gives an adequate match to the data. To account for the early cooling phase, we assume the presence of a dense circumstellar material surrounding the progenitor, with a mass of 0.27 Msun and an extension of 500 Rsun. A comparison and modeling of a select group of SNe–SN 2006aj, SN 2020bvc and SN 2023pel–is also presented. A remarkable similarity emerges between SN 2025kg and SN 2023pel. As SN 2023pel was recently proposed to be powered by a magnetar, this further supports the magnetar scenario for SN 2025kg.</p>

<p>2025-07-27, <strong>A Systematic Search for AGN Flares in ZTF Data Release 23</strong>, Lei He et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20232v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.20232v1</a></p>

<p>Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to exhibit stochastic variability across a wide range of timescales and wavelengths. AGN flares are extreme outbursts that deviate from this typical behavior and may trace a range of energetic physical processes. Using six years of data from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 23, we conduct a systematic search for AGN flares among a sample of well-sampled AGNs and AGN candidates. We construct two catalogs: the AGN Flare Coarse Catalog (AGNFCC), containing 28,504 flares identified via Bayesian blocks and Gaussian Processes, and the AGN Flare Refined Catalog (AGNFRC), comprising 1,984 high-confidence flares selected using stricter criteria. We analyze their spatial distribution, temporal characteristics, host AGN type and potential origins. Some flares can be associated with known supernovae, tidal disruption events, or blazars, and a few may be linked to binary black hole mergers or microlensing events. These catalogs provide a valuable resource for studying transient phenomena in AGNs and are publicly available at https://github.com/Lyle0831/AGN-Flares.</p>

<p>2025-07-27, <strong>New symbiotic stars or candidates in LAMOST low resolution spectra</strong>, Yabing Zhao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20206v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.20206v1</a></p>

<p>Symbiotic stars are among the most crucial binary systems for studying binary star interactions and Type Ia supernova progenitors. Based on the unique observational characteristics of symbiotic stars, strong H I, He I emission lines, giant spectral features, and the presence of [O III], He II, O VI, and other emission lines with ionization potentials exceeding 35 eV, and the Gaia information, we search for new symbiotic stars using the low-resolution spectroscopic survey data from LAMOST. Thirty-six binary systems have been selected as symbiotic stars or candidates, in which the five known symbiotic stars are included. Among them five systems (ZTF J005917.52+315605.4, ATO J094137.5+075304, LAMOST J200310.90+360822.6, LAMOST J072528.18+342530.4, and V* V758 Cyg) have been found as new symbiotic stars. Notably, LAMOST J072528.18+342530.4 and V* V758 Cyg were also confirmed as new symbiotic stars in a recent study. For the remaining 26 candidates, classification is based solely on the presence of [O III] emission lines (with ionization potentials &gt; 35 eV) and the absence of He II high-excitation emission lines. Further observations are needed to confirm their nature as symbiotic stars.</p>
