<p>2025-10-27, <strong>Production of Hyperons, Charmed Baryons, and Hadronic Molecule Candidates in Neutrino-Proton Reaction</strong>, Kai-sa Qiao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23370v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.23370v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the production of hyperons, charmed baryons, and potential hadronic molecular states in neutrino-proton ($\bar{\nu}_\mu p$) reaction, a process characterized by a particularly clean final state. Employing effective Lagrangians, chiral perturbation theory, and a hadronic molecular model, we perform theoretical calculations for several relevant channels, including those leading to the formation of the hadronic molecular candidate $(\bar{D}N)$. Our results indicate that future neutrino facilities could serve as a complementary platform for exploring exotic baryonic states and provide valuable insights into the dynamics of strong interactions in the strange and charm sectors.</p>

<p>2025-10-27, <strong>Can KM3-230213A be compatible with a cosmogenic origin?</strong>, The KM3NeT collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23287v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.23287v1</a></p>

<p>On the 13th February 2023 the KM3NeT/ARCA telescope observed a track-like event compatible with a ultra-high-energy muon with an estimated energy of 120 PeV, produced by a neutrino with an even higher energy, making it the most energetic neutrino event ever detected. The reported equivalent flux suggest the possible existence of a new diffuse component. A diffuse cosmogenic flux is expected to originate from the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with ambient photon and matter fields. Here we show that this component can be compatible with the reported flux level only integrating the cosmogenic emission, at least up to redshift ~$z = 6 $ and assuming a subdominant fraction of protons in the ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray flux, thus placing constraints on known cosmic accelerators. These conditions impose constraints on known cosmic accelerators and open a window into an unexplored region of the Universe at this energy scale.</p>

<p>2025-10-27, <strong>Effective Theory for Light Portal Dark Matter Detection</strong>, Qing Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22966v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.22966v1</a></p>

<p>We develop a general framework for the computation of light portal dark matter direct detection, incorporating a consistent treatment of finite momentum transfer. In this framework, dark matter interacts with Standard Model matter through a light mediator, which simultaneously serves as the force carrier for dark matter self-interaction, potentially with a distinct coupling strength. The corresponding effective theory relevant for detecting this class of dark matter is systematically constructed. Our analysis focuses on light (semi)relativistic dark matter, which may originate from cosmic-ray boosting and can be probed in high threshold experiments such as large-volume neutrino detectors. In this context, the nucleon matrix elements of the effective operators at finite momentum transfer are required, made available through recent advances in lattice QCD and related nonperturbative methods. The relativistic Fermi gas model is used to convert the nucleon-level momentum transfer to the nuclear level, thereby incorporating nuclear effects pertinent to heavy target experiments. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, we present ultraviolet-complete examples featuring spin-1 and spin-2 portal dark matter. For these models, we compute the differential cross sections with respect to momentum transfer, adopting parameter choices that address the so-called core-cusp problem in astrophysical observations via dark matter self-interactions.</p>

<p>2025-10-27, <strong>Axion in the minimal SO(10) GUT</strong>, Takeshi Fukuyama et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22962v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.22962v1</a></p>

<p>The QCD axion is investigated within the minimal supersymmetric SO(10) grand unified theory, where the Yukawa sector involves Higgs multiplets ${\bf 10}$ and $\overline$. The relative phase between the VEVs of $({\bf 10,1,3})\subset\overline$ and $({\bf \overline{10},1,3})\subset{\bf 126}$ under ${\rm SU}(4)_C\times{\rm SU}(2)_L\times{\rm SU}(2)_R$ is identified with the axion. The Peccei-Quinn and $B-L$ symmetry breaking scales coincide through $|\langle\Delta_R\rangle|=|\langle\overline{\Delta}_R\rangle|$. The scalar partner of the lightest right-handed neutrino plays the role of the inflaton, realizing hybrid inflation consistent with the observed CMB density fluctuations. After inflation, both fields acquire VEVs, and the domain-wall problem is resolved through the Lazarides-Shafi mechanism, which naturally restricts the model to three generations.</p>

<p>2025-10-27, <strong>Constraint on the physical origin of GRB prompt emission via its non-detected diffuse neutrino emission</strong>, Yang-Dong-Jun Ou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22914v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.22914v1</a></p>

<p>The physical origin of prompt emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains an open question since it has been studied more than half a century. Three alternative models (i.e. dissipative photosphere, internal shock, and ICMART) have been proposed to interpret the observations of GRB prompt emission, but none of them can fully interpret all of the observational data collected so far. The question is that what is the fraction of these three theoretical models in the prompt emission of GRB, respectively. In this paper, we propose to utilize an innovative method, and constrain the fraction of GRB prompt emission models via its non-detected diffuse neutrinos. By adopting two methods (e.g., summing up the individual GRB contributions and assumed luminosity functions of GRB) to calculate diffuse neutrino flux of GRBs for given the benchmark parameters of $\Gamma=300$ and $\varepsilon_{p} \text{/} \varepsilon_{e}=10$, both approaches indicate that most GRBs should be originated from the ICMART model. Moreover, we find that the fractions of the dissipative photosphere model, the internal shock model, and the ICMART model are constrained to be [0, $0.5\%$], [0, $1.1\%$], and [$98.9\%$, 1], respectively for the method of summing up the individual GRB contributions. For the method of luminosity functions, the fractions of above three models are constrained to be [0, $6.1\%$], [0, $8.2\%$], and [$91.8\%$, 1], respectively. However, such fractions of different models are also dependent on the parameters of $\Gamma$ and $\varepsilon_{p} \text{/} \varepsilon_{e}$.</p>

<p>2025-10-26, <strong>Quantum Information Meets High-Energy Physics: Probing Neutrinos and Beyond</strong>, Raoul Serao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22625v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.22625v1</a></p>

<p>This review explores the interplay between quantum information theory and high-energy physics, emphasizing how decoherence effects and unconventional neutrino oscillation patterns may unveil fundamental properties such as the Dirac or Majorana nature of neutrinos and potential CPT violation. It further discusses the use of entanglement measures as novel probes of axion-mediated interactions, outlining interdisciplinary strategies to test the limits of the Standard Model and explore new physics beyond it.</p>

<p>2025-10-27, <strong>Cosmic Vine: High abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster at z=3.44</strong>, Nikolaj B. Sillassen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23549v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.23549v1</a></p>

<p>The Cosmic Vine is a massive protocluster at z=3.44 in the JWST CEERS field, offering an ideal laboratory for studying the early phases of cluster formation. Using the data from the DAWN JWST Archive, we conduct a comprehensive study on the large-scale structure, stellar mass function (SMF), quiescent members, and dark matter halos in the Cosmic Vine. First, we spectroscopically confirm 136 galaxies in the Vine at z=3.44, and an additional 47 galaxies belonging to a diffuse foreground structure at z=3.34 which we dub the Leaf. We identify four subgroups comprising the Cosmic Vine and two subgroups within the Leaf. Second, we identified 11 quiescent members with log(M<em>/Msun)=9.5-11.0, the largest sample of quiescent galaxies in overdense environments at z&gt;3, which gives an enhanced quiescent galaxy number density 2x10^(-4)cMpc^(-3) that is three times above the field level at log(M</em>/Msun) &gt; 10. Notably, these quiescent members form a tight red sequence on the color-magnitude diagram, making it one of the earliest red sequences known to date. Third, by constructing the SMFs for both star-forming and quiescent members, we find that both SMFs are top-heavy, with a significantly enhanced quiescent fraction at log(M*/Msun)&gt;10.5 compared to field counterparts. The stellar mass-size analysis reveals that star-forming members are more compact at higher masses than their field counterparts. Finally, we estimate a halo mass of log(Mh/Msun)=13.2+-0.3 for the protocluster core, and log(Mh/Msun)=11.9-12.4 for satellite subgroups. The phase-space analysis indicates that three subgroups are likely infalling to the core. This work reveals a high abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster, demonstrating the accelerated assembly of massive galaxies in massive halos when the Universe was less than 2 billion years old.</p>

<p>2025-10-27, <strong>Dynamical friction shear and rotation in Chaplygin cosmology</strong>, A. Del Popolo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23481v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.23481v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, we build upon the findings of Del Popolo et al. (2013) by further analyzing the influence of dynamical friction on the evolution of cosmological perturbations within the framework of the spherical collapse model (SCM) in a Universe dominated by generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG). Specifically, we investigate how dynamical friction alters the growth rate of density perturbations, the effective sound speed, the equation-of-state parameter www, and the evolution of the cosmic expansion rate. Our results demonstrate that dynamical friction significantly delays the collapse process compared to the standard SCM. Accurate computation of these parameters is crucial for obtaining consistent results and reliable physical interpretations when employing the GCG model. Furthermore, our analysis confirms that the suppression of perturbation growth due to dynamical friction is considerably more pronounced than that caused by shear and rotation, as previously indicated by Del Popolo et al. (2013). This enhanced suppression effectively addresses the instability issues, such as oscillations or exponential divergences in the dark-matter power spectrum, highlighted in linear perturbation studies, such as those by Sandvik et al. (2004).</p>

<p>2025-10-27, <strong>Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Dark Matter in Flux Compactification</strong>, Kento Akamatsu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23388v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.23388v1</a></p>

<p>We study a six-dimensional U(1)$_\chi$ gauge theory compactified on a magnetized torus, where the zero mode of the extra-dimensional gauge field (a Wilson-line (WL) scalar field) plays the role of a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone (pNG) dark matter (DM) candidate. The pNG DM is naturally included by construction without introducing an additional scalar field. We show that the leading spin-independent DM-nucleus amplitude is suppressed by momentum transfer in our model as expected from the pNG DM model. This suppression allows the model to evade the current severe direct-detection bounds while achieving the observed thermal relic abundance in well-defined regions of parameter space.</p>

<p>2025-10-27, <strong>The role of supercluster filaments in shaping galaxy clusters</strong>, Raúl Baier-Soto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23311v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.23311v1</a></p>

<p>In a hierarchical $\Lambda$CDM Universe, cosmic filaments serve as the primary channels for matter accretion into galaxy clusters, influencing the shape of their dark matter halos. We investigate whether the elongation of galaxy clusters correlates with the orientation of surrounding filaments, providing the first observational test of this relationship in large supercluster regions. We identified and characterized cosmic filaments in two dimensions within the two superclusters that are part of the low-redshift sub-survey of the Chilean Cluster Galaxy Evolution Survey (CHANCES): the Shapley supercluster and the Horologium-Reticulum supercluster. We analyzed the alignment between filament directions –traced by galaxy distributions- and the triaxiality of cluster gravitational potentials –traced by X-ray emission- using publicly available optical and X-ray data. We have found that most (82%) of the X-ray clusters are associated with and interconnected by the optically detected filaments. The clusters-filaments alignment analysis shows that the elongation of most clusters is well aligned with nearby filaments, providing observational confirmation of theoretical predictions, with the alignment progressively reducing at larger cluster-centric distances ($&gt; 1.6 r_{200}$). Overall, our results support the notion that filaments are the main source of galaxy accretion at redshift below 0.1 and additionally provide evidence that matter accretion through filaments shapes the gravitational potential of galaxy clusters. We propose this measurement as a simple observational proxy to determine the direction of accretion in clusters, which is key to understanding both galaxy evolution and the merger history of galaxy clusters.</p>

<p>2025-10-27, <strong>Validation of field cage and cathode for low radioactivity operation with the CYGNO experiment</strong>, F. D. Amaro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23229v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.23229v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter, which is considered to account for approximately the 27% of the Universe’s energy-mass content, remains an open issue in modern particle physics along with its composition. The CYGNO Experiment aims to exploit an innovative approach applied to the direct detection search of low energy nuclear recoils possibly induced by cold particle-like dark matter candidates. CYGNO employs a directional detector based on a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) filled with a He:CF$_{4}$ gas mixture and equipped with an optical readout. Currently, the CYGNO Collaboration is constructing the detector demonstrator, CYGNO-04, in Hall F at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS). This 0.4 m$^3$ detector has the goal of proving the scalability of the technology and assessing the physics and radiopurity capabilities. Given the low radioactivity requirements, especially in internal components such as field cage and cathode, the reduction of material while keeping the correct electrical behavior is paramount. In this paper, we present the validation of several internal components, mainly focusing on the field cage material and support structure. The tests included geometrical asymmetries in the electric field response, collection efficiency as well as measurement of known physical quantities. A preferred configuration is found with a structure based on Nylon material which supports a PET or Kapton sheet with copper strips deposited on.</p>

<p>2025-10-27, <strong>Recasting and Forecasting Dark Matter Limits Without Raw Data: A Generalized Algorithm for Gamma-Ray Telescopes</strong>, Giacomo D’Amico et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23168v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.23168v1</a></p>

<p>We present a novel method for both forecasting and recasting upper limits (ULs) on dark matter (DM) annihilation cross sections, $\left&lt; \sigma v \right&gt;^{UL}$, or decay lifetime $\tau^{LL}$ . The forecasting method relies solely on the instrument response functions (IRFs) to predict ULs for a given observational setup, without the need for full analysis pipelines. The recasting procedure uses published ULs to reinterpret constraints for alternative DM models or channels. We demonstrate its utility across a range of canonical annihilation channels, including $b\bar{b}$, $W^+W^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, and $\mu^+\mu^-$, and apply it to several major gamma-ray experiments, including MAGIC, \textit{Fermi}-LAT, and CTAO. Notably, we develop a recasting approach that remains effective even when the IRF is unavailable by extracting generalized IRF-dependent coefficients from benchmark channels. We apply this method to reinterpret ULs derived from standard spectra (e.g., PPPC4DMID) in terms of more recent DM scenarios, including a Higgsino-like model with mixed final states and spectra generated with the CosmiXs model. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and direct comparison with published results confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method, with discrepancies remaining within statistical uncertainties. The algorithm is generally applicable to any scenario where the expected signal model is parametric, offering a powerful tool for reinterpreting existing gamma-ray limits and efficiently exploring the DM parameter space in current and future indirect detection experiments.</p>

<p>2025-10-27, <strong>Search for Invisible Decay Modes in Nuclear Gamma Cascades of a ${}^{46}$Sc Source Using a CsI (Tl) Detector</strong>, Sharada Sahoo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23001v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.23001v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter remains one of the most compelling open questions in modern physics, motivating extensive searches for new light, weakly coupled particles beyond the Standard Model. Numerous experiments have probed a variety of dark matter candidates using diverse detector technologies, yet large regions of parameter space remain unexplored. In this work, we present a novel high-statistics search for invisible decay modes in nuclear $\gamma$ cascades, employing approximately 100~kg of CsI(Tl) scintillators at Texas A\&amp;M University. The key feature of this experiment is the use of a high-activity ${}^{46}$Sc radioactive source combined with a “missing gamma” technique, in which the absence of a photon in a well-identified cascade serves as a signature of new physics. Unlike appearance–disappearance experiments, this approach requires only a single photon conversion into a dark-sector particle, thereby enabling sensitivity to weaker couplings. With approximately 1000~hours of data collected using the current setup, no statistically significant excess was observed, consistent with existing constraints on dark-sector candidates such as axions and axion-like particles (ALPs), dark scalars, and dark photons in the sub-MeV mass range. This result highlights the sensitivity of the missing-gamma technique and motivates the development of a larger-scale detector with improved systematic control to extend dark-sector searches into previously unexplored regions of parameter space.</p>

<p>2025-10-26, <strong>Scintillation of liquid nitrogen</strong>, L. Pagani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22746v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.22746v1</a></p>

<p>Liquid nitrogen is commonly used in cryogenic applications and is a promising medium for the direct immersion cooling of sensors used for nuclear and particle physics experiments. The scintillation properties of gaseous nitrogen are well-documented, but little is known about the scintillation of liquid nitrogen. If present, scintillation light from interactions of ambient radioactivity could produce backgrounds for rare event searches such as the direct detection of dark matter. Using a coincidence-tagged alpha decay, we demonstrate that liquid nitrogen exhibits measurable, albeit very faint, scintillation. Assuming the same scintillation wavelength spectrum as gaseous nitrogen, we estimate a relative scintillation yield of $Y_{\text{LN}}/Y^{\text{STP}}_{\text{GN}} = 0.0142 \pm 0.0005\text{(stat)} \pm 0.0030\text{(sys)}$ with respect to gaseous nitrogen at standard temperature and pressure. Considering the average scintillation yield from alpha decays in gaseous nitrogen, this implies a scintillation yield for alpha decays in liquid nitrogen of $Y_{\text{LN}} = 2.39 \pm 0.56$ photons per MeV. To our knowledge this is the first measurement of scintillation in liquid nitrogen.</p>

<p>Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) model is a leading dark matter candidate that arises naturally in extensions of the Standard Model. In the Galactic Center, ULDM manifests as dense hydrogen-like boson clouds or self-gravitating soliton cores. We present the first study of the gravitational effects of these ULDM structures on pulsar orbits around Sgr A*, using pulsar timing as a precision dynamical probe, based on a comprehensive and practical framework that includes various kinds of black hole and orbital parameters. Our analysis shows that long-term pulsar monitoring – one of the key objectives of future SKA science – could detect a boson cloud with a total mass as low as $O(M_\odot)$ for boson mass $m \sim 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}$, and probe a wide range of soliton core masses in the lower-mass regime, assuming a conservative timing precision of $\sigma_{\mathrm{TOA}}=1\,\mathrm{ms}$.</p>

<p>2025-10-26, <strong>Some Properties of Multi-Component Axion Dark Matter</strong>, Hai-Jun Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22569v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.22569v1</a></p>

<p>We introduce a mechanism for multi-component dark matter (DM) that originates from axion mixing. In this context, multi-component DM implies that the cold DM is composed of the QCD axion and many ultra-light axion-like particles (ALPs). This framework can be realized in the type IIB string axiverse with hierarchical axion masses and decay constants. Our investigation reveals that in the light QCD axion scenario, the energy density of the lightest ALP often dominates after mixing, invalidating the canonical light axion scenario. On the other hand, in the heavy QCD axion scenario, both the QCD axion and non-lightest ALPs may dominate, depending on the ALP decay constants. Under certain conditions, the canonical heavy axion scenario remains valid. Finally, we briefly discuss a theoretical framework featuring $\sim\mathcal{O}(100)$ axions, with hierarchical axion masses and decay constants.</p>

<p>2025-10-27, <strong>The MandelZoom project II: the impact of stellar feedback on black hole accretion through an $α$-disc in dwarf galaxies with a resolved interstellar medium</strong>, Eun-jin Shin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23548v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.23548v1</a></p>

<p>We present a suite of high-resolution simulations to study how different stellar feedback channels regulate the growth of central intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters (NSCs). We employ a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the self-gravity radius of the $\alpha$-accretion disc ($&lt;0.01$~pc) and follow the gas inflows from the interstellar medium (ISM) to the black hole (BH), allowing for the self-consistent emergence of circumnuclear discs (CNDs). In the absence of stellar feedback, as expected, the galactic disc fragments excessively, producing a massive CND. When radiative stellar feedback is included, fragmentation is suppressed, with even more massive CNDs forming and feeding the IMBH. With supernova (SN) feedback only, clustered SNe strongly heat the ISM, yielding both the lowest CND masses and BH accretion rates. When both radiative stellar feedback and SNe are included, the CND becomes intermittent: it survives for $10$–$100$~Myr, and is then destroyed by feedback before being replenished by fresh galactic inflows, while substantial BH growth still takes place. These results highlight the critical importance of accurately modelling the combined effects of key stellar feedback processes to understand IMBH growth. Our simulation suite brackets the likely range of CND states, with IMBHs exhibiting significant growth and systematic spin-up in all dwarf galaxy models explored. These findings bode well for the detection of IMBHs with future observational facilities such as SKA, the Rubin Observatory, and LISA, and make them highly relevant progenitor candidates of the high-redshift supermassive BHs observed by JWST.</p>

<p>2025-10-27, <strong>Discovery of SN 2025wny: a Strongly Gravitationally Lensed Superluminous Supernova at z = 2.01</strong>, Joel Johansson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23533v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.23533v1</a></p>

<p>We present the discovery of SN 2025wny (ZTF25abnjznp/GOTO25gtq) and spectroscopic classification of this event as the first gravitationally lensed Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSN-I). Deep ground-based follow-up observations resolves four images of the supernova with ~1.7” angular separation from the main lens galaxy, each coincident with the lensed images of a background galaxy seen in archival imaging of the field. Spectroscopy of the brightest point image shows narrow features matching absorption lines at a redshift of z = 2.011 and broad features matching those seen in superluminous SNe with Far-UV coverage. We infer a magnification factor of 20 to 50 for the brightest image in the system, based on photometric and spectroscopic comparisons to other SLSNe-I. SN 2025wny demonstrates that gravitationally-lensed SNe are in reach of ground-based facilities out to redshifts far higher than what has been previously assumed, and provide a unique window into studying distant supernovae, internal properties of dwarf galaxies, as well as for time-delay cosmography.</p>

<p>A major goal of computational astrophysics is to simulate the Milky Way Galaxy with sufficient resolution down to individual stars. However, the scaling fails due to some small-scale, short-timescale phenomena, such as supernova explosions. We have developed a novel integration scheme of $N$-body/hydrodynamics simulations working with machine learning. This approach bypasses the short timesteps caused by supernova explosions using a surrogate model, thereby improving scalability. With this method, we reached 300 billion particles using 148,900 nodes, equivalent to 7,147,200 CPU cores, breaking through the billion-particle barrier currently faced by state-of-the-art simulations. This resolution allows us to perform the first star-by-star galaxy simulation, which resolves individual stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. The performance scales over $10^4$ CPU cores, an upper limit in the current state-of-the-art simulations using both A64FX and X86-64 processors and NVIDIA CUDA GPUs.</p>

<p>2025-10-27, <strong>A volcanic chronosequence as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to study the cosmic-ray flux in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene</strong>, Claudio Galelli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23126v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.23126v1</a></p>

<p>We present a phenomenological study demonstrating the feasibility of using olivine xenoliths from the Cha\^ine des Puys as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to probe the cosmic-ray flux over the last 40,000 years. This volcanic region provides a unique chronosequence of samples brought to the surface by well-dated eruptions. By modeling the expected density of nuclear recoil tracks induced by cosmic-ray muons in olivine, we show that the signal is detectable and above backgrounds from natural radioactivity. We demonstrate that by analyzing samples with different exposure ages, it is possible to construct a time-differential measurement of the cosmic-ray flux. This method shows sensitivity to historical variations, such as the enhanced flux expected during the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion ($\sim$41~kyr) and the potential contribution from nearby supernovae, for which we use the Antlia supernova remnant precursor as a benchmark. This work establishes a new application of the paleo-detector technique for long-scale time-domain high-energy astrophysics and provides the direct scientific motivation for experimental efforts to measure these track records.</p>

<p>In this work, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) using the arbitrary redshift pivot Pad'e-(2,1) expansion methodology developed in arXiv:2509.16196. This approach allows us to constrain cosmographic parameters and test CDDR at a particular redshift. Further, it does not rely on data reconstructions or extrapolations of the cosmographic parameters to higher redshifts. We employ observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Baryon Acoustic Oscillation dataset, cosmic chronometers, and Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon Plus and Dark Energy Survey Year 5 compilations. We find no significant deviations from the standard CDDR relation, with constraints reaching sub-percent precision across most redshifts in the range $0\lesssim z \lesssim 1$.</p>

<p>2025-10-27, <strong>SN 2024iss: A Double-peaked Type IIb Supernova with Evidence of Circumstellar Interaction</strong>, Liyang Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22997v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.22997v1</a></p>

<p>We present optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray observations of supernova (SN) 2024iss, a Type IIb SN that shows a prominent double-peaked light curve. We modeled the first peak with a semianalytical shock-cooling model and the X-ray emission with a free-free model. We compare the envelope radius and mass-loss rate with other Type IIb SNe to explore the relationships between the progenitor envelope and the circumstellar material (CSM). The shock-cooling peak in the $V$-band light curve reached $M_V = -17.33\pm 0.26$mag, while the $^{56}$Ni-powered second peak attained $M_V = -17.43\pm 0.26$mag. Early spectra show an photospheric velocity of $\sim19,400\,km\,s^{-1}$ at 3.82days from the H$\alpha$ P~Cygni profile. The Balmer lines persist at least +87 days after the explosion, characterizing hydrogen-rich ejecta. Modeling the first light-curve peak suggests an extended envelope with a mass of $0.11\pm0.04\,M_{\odot}$ and a radius of $244\pm43~R_{\odot}$. Fitting the second light-curve peak with an Arnett-like model indicates a typical $^{56}$Ni mass of $ 0.117\pm0.013~M_{\odot}$ and a relatively low ejecta mass of $1.272\pm0.343\,M_{\odot}$. X-ray observations reveal bright thermal bremsstrahlung emission and indicate a mass-loss rate of $1.6\times10^{-5}\ M_{\odot} \ \rm{yr}^{-1}$. SN 2024iss occupies a transitional position between the two subclasses of extended (eIIb) and compact (cIIb) Type IIb SNe. Its envelope radius and pre-explosion mass-loss rate appear to be correlated as theoretically predicted. The observational properties of SN 2024iss are compatible with a binary interaction scenario being the dominant mechanism for envelope stripping. Furthermore, the low column density of neutral hydrogen suggests a compact CSM with an outer radius of $\lesssim1.3\times10^{14}$ cm, indicating that the progenitor star experienced eruptive mass loss within $\sim4\,yr$ of its terminal explosion.</p>

<p>2025-10-27, <strong>SN2017ckj: A linearly declining Type IIb supernova with a relatively massive hydrogen envelope</strong>, L. -H. Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22989v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.22989v1</a></p>

<p>We present optical observations of the Type IIb supernova (SN) 2017ckj, covering approximately 180 days after the explosion. Its early-time multi-band light curves display no clear evidence of a shock-cooling tail, resembling the behavior of SN2008ax. The $V$-band light curve exhibits a short rise time of about 5 days and reaches an absolute peak magnitude of $M_{\rm V}=-18.58\pm0.17\mathrm{mag}$. The late-time multi-band light curves reveal a linear decline. We modelled the bolometric light curve of SN2017ckj to constrain the progenitor and the explosion parameters. We estimated a total mass of $\rm ^{56}Ni$ synthesized by SN2017ckj of $M_{\rm Ni} = 0.21^{+0.05}_{-0.03}\ M_\odot$, with a massive H-rich envelope of $M_{\rm env} = 0.4^{+0.1}_{-0.1}\ M_\odot$. Both the $\rm ^{56}Ni$ mass and the envelope mass of SN2017ckj are higher than those of typical SNe IIb, in agreement with its peculiar light curve evolution. The early-time spectra of SN2017ckj are dominated by a blue continuum, accompanied by narrow $\rm H_\alpha$ and \Heii emission lines. The earliest spectrum exhibits flash ionization features, from which we estimated a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\sim 3.4\times10^{-4}M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. At later epochs, the spectra develop broad P-Cygni profiles and become increasingly similar to those of SNe IIb, especially SN2018gk. The late-time spectrum at around 139 days does not show a distinct decline in the strength of $\rm H_\alpha$ emission profile, also indicating a relatively massive envelope of its progenitor. Aside from the $\rm H_\alpha$ feature, the nebular spectrum exhibits prominent emission lines of \Oi, \Caii, [\Caii], and \Mgi], which are consistent with the prototypical SN1993J.</p>

<p>2025-10-26, <strong>A new group of low-spin $50-70M_\odot$ Black Holes and the high pair-instability mass cutoff</strong>, Yuan-Zhu Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22698v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.22698v1</a></p>

<p>Pair-instability supernovae (PISN) will not leave compact remnants and hence yield a mass gap of the black holes. Though a transition point of $\sim 45M_\odot$ between low-spin and high-spin black holes groups had been inferred with gravitational wave data since 2022 and then interpreted as the signature of the PISN mass gap, here we report the emergence of a new group of low-spin but massive ($\sim 50-70M_\odot$) black holes, which are hard to produce via hierarchical mergers, in the latest GWTC-4.0 data. Correspondingly, the mass cutoff of the low-spin black holes shifts to $68.5^{+19.8}_{-18.5}M_\odot$ ($90\%$ credibility), which is consistent with the PISN model for a low $^{12}C(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}O$ reaction rate of $S_{300{\rm keV}} \sim 110~{\rm keV~b}$. Despite that the massive single-star collapse/dynamical capture origin can not be reliably tested at this moment, a high pair-instability mass cutoff $M_{\rm low}\sim 70M_\odot$ may be favored for its capability of accounting for the rather low observation rate of hydrogen-less super-luminous supernovae.</p>

<p>2025-10-26, <strong>Refined Low-Energy Supernova Constraints on Lepton Flavor Violating Axions</strong>, Zi-Miao Huang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22523v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.22523v1</a></p>

<p>The supernova (SN) core, characterized by its extreme temperature and density, serves as a unique laboratory for new-physics searches. Low-energy supernovae (LESNe) provide particularly powerful probes, as their low explosion energies place stringent limits on any additional energy deposition in the mantle by new particles. We present refined LESN constraints on lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) with electron-muon couplings. We consider four production channels in the SN: muon decay, lepton bremsstrahlung, electron-muon coalescence, and semi-Compton scattering, the last of which is investigated here for the first time in the context of LFV-ALPs. We find that muon decay dominates in the low-mass regime, electron-muon coalescence in the high-mass regime, and semi-Compton scattering in the intermediate-mass range. To derive accurate limits, we compute both the energy transfer from the SN core to the mantle and the energy loss due to ALP production in the mantle, which can be substantial for both large and small couplings – the latter case, to our knowledge, not previously noted in the literature. We find that LESNe provide the most stringent constraints on the parameter space for ALP masses above $\sim 110$ MeV. These refined results strengthen previous SN bounds and highlight the exceptional sensitivity of LESNe to LFV new physics.</p>

<p>2025-10-26, <strong>Magnesium Isotopic Detection in Cool Stars: Tracing Nucleosynthetic Signatures from MgH Features</strong>, Quin Aicken Davies et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22487v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.22487v1</a></p>

<p>Magnesium (Mg) isotopic ratios offer valuable insights into stellar nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution, particularly in distinguishing contributions from supernovae and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. These isotopes are accessible via MgH molecular features in cool stellar atmospheres, though their measurement remains challenging across spectral types. We assess the reliability of MgH spectral regions for extracting magnesium isotopic ratios ($^{24}$Mg, $^{25}$Mg, $^{26}$Mg) in stars from M to G types and evaluate consistency with nucleosynthetic expectations. Using spectrum synthesis, we applied an analysis pipeline, validated by three well-studied reference stars, to a sample of five additional dwarf and giant stars. Individual MgH band regions were analysed for sensitivity to isotopic variation. Europium (Eu) and barium (Ba) abundances were also measured to explore correlations with Mg isotopic ratios as r- and s-process proxies. Of ten previously studied MgH wavelength regions, we identify seven as most reliable for isotopic analysis; others showed limited sensitivity across stellar types. Derived Mg isotope ratios ($^{24}$Mg, $^{25}$Mg, $^{26}$Mg) include: HD 11695-81:7:12; HD 18884-81:7:12; HD 18907-69:9:23; HD 22049-71:16:13; HD 23249-66:13:22; HD 128621-67:17:16; HD 10700-78:10:12; HD 100407-65:10:25. Comparison of Eu abundances with Mg isotopes reveals strong correlations, particularly with ($^{24}$Mg, which is predominantly produced by hydrostatic $\alpha$-capture in massive stars, a process preceding the r-process responsible for Eu. In contrast, Ba shows no significant correlation with $^{25}$Mg or $^{26}$Mg, despite their shared s-process origin. Our results demonstrate that selected MgH regions can reliably measure Mg isotopes in cool stars, providing a reproducible framework for future studies of stellar nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution.</p>
