<p>2025-01-22, <strong>Characterization of a fiber laser hydrophone for acoustic neutrino detection</strong>, E. J. Buis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12999v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12999v1</a></p>

<p>This paper presents the development and characterization of a fiber laser hydrophone designed for deep-sea applications, with a focus on detecting neutrino interactions via their acoustic signatures. The hydrophone design includes a static pressure compensation mechanism, ensuring reliable operation at depths exceeding 1 km. The performance of the hydrophone was evaluated through laboratory tests and experiments in an anechoic basin, where its transfer function was measured before and after a 140-bar pressure cycle. The results show that the hydrophone maintains its sensitivity, with resonance peaks identified in both low- and high-frequency ranges. The hydrophone’s sensitivity to acoustic signals was also compared to ambient sea state noise levels, demonstrating compatibility with the lowest noise conditions.</p>

<p>Astrophysical neutrinos with energy in the TeV-PeV range traverse megaparsecs (Mpc) to gigaparsecs (Gpc) scale distances before they reach the Earth. Tiny physics effects that get accumulated over these large propagation paths during their journey may become observable at the detector. If there is some new interaction between neutrinos and the background matter, that can potentially affect the propagation of the astrophysical neutrinos. One such possible case is the flavor-dependent long-range interaction of neutrinos, which can affect the standard neutrino flavor transition, modifying the flavor composition of the astrophysical neutrinos at Earth. Using the present-day and future projection of the flavor-composition measurements of IceCube and IceCube-Gen2 along with the present and future measurement of the oscillation parameters, we explore the sensitivity of these experiments to probe long-range neutrino interaction with matter.</p>

<p>2025-01-22, <strong>On the Use of WGANs for Super Resolution in Dark-Matter Simulations</strong>, John Brennan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13056v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.13056v1</a></p>

<p>Super-resolution techniques have the potential to reduce the computational cost of cosmological and astrophysical simulations. This can be achieved by enabling traditional simulation methods to run at lower resolution and then efficiently computing high-resolution data corresponding to the simulated low-resolution data. In this work, we investigate the application of a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) to increase the particle resolution of dark-matter-only simulations, reproducing and building on prior results. Our WGAN models successfully generate high-resolution data with summary statistics, including the power spectrum and halo mass function, that closely match those of true high-resolution simulations. We also identify a limitation of the WGAN model in the form of smeared features in the generated high-resolution snapshots, particularly in the shapes of dark-matter halos.</p>

<p>2025-01-22, <strong>Constraining the shape of dark matter haloes using only starlight. I. A new technique and its application to the galaxy Nube</strong>, Jorge Sanchez Almeida et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13015v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.13015v1</a></p>

<p>We present a new technique to constrain the gravitational potential of a galaxy from the observed stellar mass surface density alone under a number of assumptions. It uses the classical Eddington Inversion Method to compute the phase-space distribution function (DF) needed for the stars to reside in a given gravitational potential. In essence, each potential defines a set of density profiles, and it is the expansion of the observed profile in this database that provides the DF. If the required DF becomes negative then the potential is inconsistent with the observed stars and can be discarded. It is particularly well-suited for analyzing low-mass low surface brightness galaxies, where photometric but not spectroscopic data can be obtained. The recently discovered low surface brightness galaxy ‘Nube’ was used to showcase its application. For the observed Nube’s stellar core to be reproduced with non-negative DF, cuspy NFW (Navarro, Frenk, and White) potentials are highly disfavored compared with potentials having cores (Schuster-Plummer or rho-230). The method assumes the stellar system to have spherical symmetry and isotropic velocity distribution, however, we discuss simple extensions that relax the need for isotropy and may help to drop the spherical symmetry assumption.</p>

<p>2025-01-22, <strong>Magnetic fields limit the mass of Population III stars even before the onset of protostellar radiation feedback</strong>, Piyush Sharda et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12734v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12734v1</a></p>

<p>The masses of Population III stars are largely unconstrained since no simulations exist that take all relevant primordial star formation physics into account. We perform the first suite of radiation magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation, with the POPSICLE project. Compared to control simulations that only include magnetic fields (MHD), protostellar ionizing and dissociating feedback, or neither, the RMHD simulation best resembles the MHD simulation during the earliest stages of collapse and star formation. In $5000\,\rm{yrs}$, the mass of the most massive star is $65\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in the RMHD simulation, compared to $120\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in simulations without magnetic fields. This difference arises because magnetic fields act against gravity, suppress mass transport, and reduce compressional heating. The maximum stellar mass of Population III stars is thus already limited by magnetic fields, even before accretion rates drop to allow significant protostellar radiative feedback. Following classical main sequence stellar evolution with MESA reveals that it is difficult to create Population III stars with masses larger than $600\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in typical dark matter minihaloes at $z \gtrsim 20$, with maximum stellar masses $\sim 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ more likely due to expected negative feedback from both magnetic fields and stellar radiation. This work lays the first step in building a full physics-informed mass function of Population III stars.</p>

<p>2025-01-22, <strong>Laser induced Compton Scattering to Dark Matter in Effective Field Theory</strong>, Kai Ma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12687v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12687v1</a></p>

<p>The detection of light dark matter (DM) is a longstanding challenge in terrestrial experiments. High-intensity facility of an intense electromagnetic field may provide a plausible strategy to study strong-field particle physics and search for light DM. In this work, we propose to search for light DM particle through the nonlinear Compton scattering in the presence of a high-intense laser field. An ultra-relativistic electron beam collides with an intense laser pulse of a number of optical photons and then decays to a pair of DM particles. We take into account the Dirac-type fermionic DM in leptophilic scenario and the DM-electron interactions in the framework of effective field theory. The decay rates of electron to a DM pair are calculated for effective DM operators of different bilinear products. We show the sensitivities of laser induced Compton scattering to the effective cutoff scale for DM lighter than 1 MeV and compare with direct detection experiments.</p>

<p>2025-01-22, <strong>A semi-analytic model for decaying dark matter halos</strong>, Ethan O. Nadler et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12636v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12636v1</a></p>

<p>Decaying dark matter (DDM) affects the evolution of cosmic structure relative to standard cold, collisionless, stable dark matter (CDM). We introduce a new semi-analytic model for the effects of two-body DDM on halo structure and subhalo populations. In this scenario, cold parent dark matter particles decay into less massive daughter particles plus dark radiation with a lifetime comparable to the age of the universe. Our DDM model is implemented in the open-source software $\texttt{Galacticus}$ and accounts for heating (due to the velocity kicks imparted on daughter particles) and mass loss (due to the parent–daughter mass splitting). We show that decays flatten and reduce the amplitude of halos’ inner density profiles. These effects make DDM subhalos susceptible to tidal disruption, which we show yields a mass-dependent suppression of the subhalo mass function relative to CDM. Our predictions for DDM density profiles, velocity dispersion profiles, and subhalo populations are consistent with results from isolated and cosmological DDM N-body simulations. Thus, our model enables efficient and accurate exploration of DDM parameter space and will be useful for deriving constraints from upcoming small-scale structure observations.</p>

<p>2025-01-22, <strong>DarkAI: Reconstructing the density, velocity and tidal field of dark matter from DESI-like bright galaxy sample</strong>, Feng Shi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12621v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12621v1</a></p>

<p>Reconstructing the dark matter density, velocity, and tidal (MTV) fields from galaxy surveys is essential for advancing our understanding of the large-scale structure of the Universe. In this work, we present a machine learning-based framework using a UNet convolutional neural network to reconstruct the MTV fields from mock samples of the DESI bright galaxy survey within the redshift range $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.4$. Our approach accounts for realistic observational effects, including geometric selection, flux-limited data, and redshift space distortion (RSD) effects, thereby improving the fidelity of the reconstructed fields. Testing on mock galaxy catalogs generated from the Jiutian N-body simulation, our method achieves significant accuracy level. The reconstructed density field exhibits strong consistency with the true field, effectively eliminating most RSD effects and achieving a cross-correlation power spectrum coefficient greater than 0.985 on scales with $k &lt; 0.1 \, h \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The velocity field reconstruction accurately captures large-scale coherent flows and small-scale turbulent features, exhibiting slopes of the grid-to-grid relationship close to unity and a scatter below $\sim$100 $\mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Additionally, the tidal field is reconstructed without bias, successfully recovering the features of the large-scale cosmic web, including clusters, filaments, sheets, and voids. Our results confirm that the proposed framework effectively captures the large-scale distribution and dynamics of dark matter while addressing key systematic challenges. These advancements provide a reliable and robust tool for analyzing current and future galaxy surveys, paving the way for new insights into cosmic structure formation and evolution.</p>

<p>2025-01-22, <strong>On Equation of State of Dark Matter around Massive Black Holes</strong>, Zhong-Ming Xie et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12574v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12574v1</a></p>

<p>The nature of Dark Matter (DM) remains mysterious despite the substantial evidence from astrophysical and cosmological observations. While the majority of DM in our universe is non-relativistic, collisionless and its equation of state (EoS) is approximately pressureless $p\simeq 0$, DM becomes relativistic near the massive black holes in galactic center. Yet its EoS is seldom discussed in the relativistic regime. Here we initially explore the possible equation of state for DM in the vicinity of Schwarzschild black holes. We work in a spherical and quasi-static background spacetime, and describe DM as a perfect fluid in equilibrium. Through numerically solving the TOV equations with physical boundary conditions, we show that DM can have static profiles near black holes and its pressure should be negative in order to support the viable density profiles $\rho$. We illustrate with two simple general equations of state, namely the power law $p \propto \rho^\gamma$ and the radius-dependent $p \propto r\cdot \rho$, and compare them with the observations of the Milky Way. Our findings provide insights into the model-building of DM, which should incorporate the possibility of negative pressure in the relativistic regime around black holes.</p>

<p>2025-01-22, <strong>Black hole in the Dekel-Zhao dark matter profile</strong>, Ali Övgün et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12559v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12559v1</a></p>

<p>Motivated by the work of Cardoso et al. [Phys. Rev. D 105 (2022) 6, L061501, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.L061501] on black holes in galaxies, we derive a new black hole solution surrounded by a Dekel-Zhao dark matter profile. The derived metric, influenced by DZ profile parameters, exhibits two distinct regimes: for $r \ll r_{\rm ch}$, exponential corrections dominate, producing significant deviations from the Schwarzschild solution near dense cores, while for $r \gg r_{\rm ch}$, these corrections vanish, restoring the Schwarzschild metric at large distances. These findings ensure consistency with general relativity in vacuum. The black hole shadow and deflection angle are analyzed, demonstrating that the shadow radius scales linearly with black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$), while higher central densities ($\rho_{\rm ch}$) result in smaller shadows, reflecting the environmental impact of dense dark matter halos. Photon dynamics reveal how DZ profiles modify critical impact parameters and effective potentials, with gravitational lensing effects highly sensitive to the scale radius ($r_{\rm ch}$). Smaller $r_{\rm ch}$ values lead to larger deflection angles due to stronger gravitational effects near compact cores. This work highlights the significance dark matter profiles in shaping black hole observables, providing a theoretical foundation for future observational studies and advancing the understanding of dark matter-black hole interactions in astrophysical and cosmological contexts.</p>

<p>2025-01-22, <strong>Evolutionary tracks, ejecta, and ionizing photons from intermediate-mass to very massive stars with PARSEC</strong>, G. Costa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12917v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12917v2</a></p>

<p>Recent advancements in stellar evolution modeling offer unprecedented accuracy in predicting the evolution and deaths of stars. We present new stellar evolutionary models computed with the updated PARSEC V2.0 code for a comprehensive and homogeneous grid of metallicities and initial masses. Nuclear reaction networks, mass loss prescriptions, and the treatment of elemental mixing have all been updated in PARSEC V2.0. We computed models for thirteen initial metallicities spanning $Z = 10^{-11}$ to $Z = 0.03$, with masses ranging from 2.0 M$_{\odot}$ to 2000 M$_{\odot}$, consisting of a library of over 1,100 ($\sim 2100$ tracks including pure-He models) full stellar evolution tracks. For each track, the evolution is followed from the pre-main-sequence to the most advanced early-asymptotic-giant-branch or the pre-supernova phases, depending on the stellar mass. Here, we describe the properties of the tracks and their chemical and structural evolution. We computed the final fates and the remnant masses and built the mass spectrum for each metallicity, finding that the combined black hole (BH) pair-instability mass gap spans just between 100 and 130 M$_{\odot}$. Moreover, the remnant masses provide models consistent with observed BH masses, such as those from the primaries of GW190521, Cygnus X-1, and $\textit{Gaia}$ BH3 binary systems. We computed and provided the chemical ejecta from stellar winds and explosive final fates, along with the ionizing photon rates. Our results show strong overall consistency with other tracks computed with different codes. A comparison with a large sample of observed massive stars in the Tarantula Nebula of the Large Magellanic Cloud shows that our tracks nicely reproduce the majority of stars that lie on the main sequence. All the models are publicly available and can be retrieved on the PARSEC database.</p>

<p>2025-01-22, <strong>Massive star clusters in the gamma-ray sky: the role of HII regions</strong>, Giada Peron et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12767v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12767v1</a></p>

<p>Massive Star Clusters (SCs) have been proposed as important CR sources, with the potential of explaining the high-energy end of the Galactic cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum, that Supernova Remnants (SNRs) seem unable to account for. Thanks to fast mass losses due to the collective stellar winds, the environment around SCs is potentially suitable for particle acceleration up to PeV energies and the energetics is enough to account for a large fraction of the Galactic CRs, if the system is efficient enough. A handful of star clusters have been detected in gamma-rays confirming the idea that particle acceleration is taking place in this environment. However, contamination by other sources often makes it difficult to constrain the contribution arising from SCs only. Here we present a new analysis of Fermi-LAT data collected towards a few massive young star clusters. The young age (&lt; 3 Myr) of the clusters guarantees that no SN has exploded in the region, allowing us to determine the power contributed by the stellar component alone, and to quantify the contribution of this type of sources to the bulk of CRs. Moreover, we will present a recent statistical investigation that quantifies the degree of correlation between gamma-ray sources and these astrophysical objects and briefly discuss the observational prospect for ASTRI and CTAO.</p>

<p>Supernova remnants (SNRs) are among the most important sources of non-thermal X-rays in the sky and likely contributors to Galactic cosmic rays and represent ideal targets to showcase the capabilities of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in performing spatially-resolved X-ray polarimetry. For the first time, we can determine the turbulence level (through the measurement of polarization degree) and the orientation (through polarization direction) of the magnetic field near the shocks, where particle acceleration occurs. IXPE reported so far the results of the observations of four SNRs: Cas A, Tycho, SN 1006 and RX J1713.7-3946. These objects exhibit a wide range of characteristics, including dynamical age, spectral composition of emission, and progenitor type. Aptly, they revealed significantly different results among them in terms of magnetic field properties and morphology, providing unexpected insights and shedding light on the particle acceleration mechanisms in astrophysical shocks.</p>

<p>2025-01-22, <strong>Formation of massive star clusters with and without iron abundance spreads in a dwarf galaxy merger</strong>, Hidenori Matsui et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12658v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12658v1</a></p>

<p>To study the formation of star clusters and their properties in a dwarf-dwarf merging galaxy, we have performed a numerical simulation of a dwarf-dwarf galaxy merger by using the Tree+GRAPE $N$-body/SPH code ASURA. In our simulation, 13 young star clusters are formed during the merger process. We show that our simulated star clusters can be divided into two types: with and without [Fe/H] abundance variations. The former is created by a seed star cluster (the first-generation stars) formed in compressed gas. These stars contaminate the surrounding gas by Type II supernovae (SNe). At that time, the energy injection is insufficient to induce an outflow of the surrounding gas. After that, the contaminated gas falls into the seed, thereby forming a new generation of stars from the contaminated gas. We also show that most star clusters are formed in the galactic central region after the second encounter and fall into the galactic center due to dynamical friction within several hundred Myr. As a result, close encounters and mergers between the clusters take place. Although the clusters with shallower gravitational potential are tidally disrupted by these close encounters, others survive and finally merge at the center of the merged dwarf galaxies to create a nuclear star cluster. Therefore, the nuclear star cluster is comprised of various stellar components in [Fe/H] abundance and age. We discuss our work in the context of observations and demonstrate the diagnostic power of high-resolution simulations in the context of star cluster formation.</p>

<p>Context. Supernova remnants are one potential source class considered a PeVatron (i.e. capable of accelerating cosmic rays above PeV energies). The shock fronts produced after the explosion of the supernova are ideal regions for particle acceleration. IC 443 is a supernova remnant that has been studied extensively at different wavelengths. We study this region using very-high-energy gamma-ray data.   Aims. We explore the region of IC 443 using 2966 days of gamma-ray data from the HAWC observatory. We study the emission of this supernova remnant and search for signatures that would show acceleration of (hadronic) cosmic rays at the PeV range.   Methods. We use the maximum likelihood estimation and a likelihood ratio test to perform a multi-source fitting search. We find the best-fit morphology and spectrum of the IC 443 region above $\sim$300 GeV that best describes the HAWC data.   Results. We observe a point source located at ($\alpha$=94.42$^{\circ}$, $\delta$=22.35$^{\circ}$) that we associate with IC 443. The measured spectrum is a simple power law with an index of -3.14$\pm$0.18, which is consistent with previous TeV observations. We also find a new extended component in the region whose emission is described by a simple power law with an index of -2.49$\pm$0.08 and which we call HAWC J0615+2213.   Conclusions. Although we cannot confirm that IC 443 is a hadronic PeVatron, we do not find any sign that the spectrum has a cut off at tens of TeV energies, with the spectrum extending to $\sim$30 TeV. Furthermore, we find a new extended source in the region. While we show evidence that this new source might be a new TeV halo, we defer a detailed analysis of this new source to another publication.</p>
