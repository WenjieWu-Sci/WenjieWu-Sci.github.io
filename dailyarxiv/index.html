<p>2024-02-20, <strong>Synergy between DUNE and T2HKK to probe Invisible Neutrino Decay</strong>, Zannatun Firdowzy Dey et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13235v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.13235v1</a></p>

<p>We address the consequence of invisible neutrino decay in the context of two long base-line neutrino experiments; T2HKK (Tokai-to-Hyper-Kamiokande-to-Korea) and DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino experiment). The main purpose of this work is to bring out the aspects of CC (charged current) and NC (neutral current) measurement at DUNE in the context of invisible neutrino decay. We find that the inclusion of NC measurements (NC) at DUNE with the charged current measurements (CC) enhances its ability to constrain invisible neutrino decay. This enhancement further increases if the total run-time changes from 7 years to 10 years at DUNE. The synergy between DUNE and T2HKK improves the constraints on invisible neutrino decay. The derived constraints are $\tau_{3}/m_{3}\leq5.51\times10^{-11}$ s/eV at $3\sigma$ CL. This constraint on the decay parameter increases further if we assume that all the oscillation parameters are measured precisely. In that case, the 3$\sigma$ constraint obtained by using the synergy between DUNE and T2HKK is $\tau_{3}/m_{3}\leq5.69\times10^{-11}$ s/eV. Again if nature prefers $\nu_{3}$ to be unstable and the decay width is $\tau_{3}/m_{3}= 2.2\times10^{-11}$ s/eV then this combination can exclude the no decay scenario at more than $5\sigma$ C. L. . Although the CP sensitivity is not much hindered in the presence of invisible neutrino decay, the measurements of $\theta_{23}$, as well as the octant sensitivity, are very much affected. Octant sensitivity improves in the lower octant in the presence of the invisible neutrino decay. However, the synergy between DUNE and T2HKK improves the overall octant sensitivity in the presence of invisible neutrino decay.</p>

<p>We attempt to find the impact of a modified Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV) system of equations on the luminosities of direct photons, neutrinos and axions for a particular axion mass in the presence of a magnetic field. We employ two different equation of states (EoSs) namely APR and FPS to generate the profiles of mass and pressure for spherically symmetric and non-rotating Neutron stars (NSs). We then compute the axions and neutrino emission rates by employing the Cooper-pair-breaking and formation process (PBF) in the core using the NSCool code. We also examine the possibility of axion to photon conversion in the magnetosphere of NSs. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the magnetic field on the actual observables, such as the energy spectrum of axions and axion-converted photon flux for three different NSs. Our comparative study indicates that axions energy spectrum and axion-converted photon flux changes significantly due to an intense magnetic field.</p>

<p>2024-02-20, <strong>Radiation back-reaction during dark-matter freeze-out via metastable bound states</strong>, Christiana Vasilaki et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13069v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.13069v1</a></p>

<p>The formation and decay of metastable bound states can deplete significantly the density of multi-TeV thermal-relic dark matter. The effect depends on the interplay of bound-state formation, ionisation, transition and decay processes. Existing calculations take into account bound-state ionisation and excitations due to the radiation of the thermal bath. However, the dynamics of Hydrogen recombination suggests that the resonant radiation produced in bound-state formation or de-excitations may backreact, ionising or exciting the bound states thus impeding recombination. In this paper we examine this effect in the context of dark-matter freeze-out. To this end, we employ the generalised Saha equilibrium equation for metastable bound states, and discuss its salient features. We show that, in sharp contrast to Hydrogen recombination, the radiation produced during dark matter freeze-out is more likely to thermalise or redshift, rather than ionise or excite the metastable bound states. This holds not only for the low-energy (resonant) radiation produced in bound-state formation and transition processes, but also for the high-energy radiation produced in dark-matter annihilations and bound-state decays. While our computations are carried out in a minimal dark $U(1)$ model, our conclusions only strengthen in more complex models.</p>

<p>2024-02-20, <strong>Sharpening the dark matter signature in gravitational waveforms I: Accretion and eccentricity evolution</strong>, Theophanes K. Karydas et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13053v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.13053v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter overdensities around black holes can alter the dynamical evolution of a companion object orbiting around it, and cause a dephasing of the gravitational waveform. Here, we present a refined calculation of the co-evolution of the binary and the dark matter distribution, taking into account the accretion of dark matter particles on the companion black hole, and generalizing previous quasi-circular calculations to the general case of eccentric orbits. These calculations are validated by dedicated N-body simulations. We show that accretion can lead to a large dephasing, and therefore cannot be neglected in general. We also demonstrate that dark matter spikes tend to circularize eccentric orbits faster than previously thought.</p>

<p>2024-02-20, <strong>Optical appearance of black holes surrounded by a dark matter halo</strong>, Caio F. B. Macedo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13047v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.13047v1</a></p>

<p>Black holes in General Relativity are described by space-time metrics that are simpler in comparison to non-vacuum compact objects. However, given the universality of the gravitational pull, it is expected that dark matter accumulates around astrophysical black holes, which can have an impact in the overall gravitational field, especially at galactic centers, and induce non-negligible effects in their observational imprints. In this work we study the optical appearance of a spherically symmetric black hole both when orbited by isotropically emitting light sources and when surrounded by a (geometrically and optically thin) accretion disk, while immersed in a dark matter halo. The black hole geometry plus the dark matter halo come as a solution of Einsteinâs field equations coupled to an anisotropic fluid whose density component follows a Hermquist-type distribution. Even in situations in which the geodesic description differs profoundly from the isolated black hole case, we find minor modifications to the primary and secondary tracks of the isotropic orbiting sources, and to the width, location, and relative luminosity of the corresponding photon rings as compared to the Schwarzschild black hole at equal black hole mass and emission models. This fact troubles distinguishing between both geometries using present observations of very-long baseline interferometry.</p>

<p>2024-02-20, <strong>Extensive search for axion dark matter over 1\,GHz with CAPPâs Main Axion eXperiment</strong>, Saebyeok Ahn et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12892v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.12892v1</a></p>

<p>We report an extensive high-sensitivity search for axion dark matter above 1\,GHz at the Center for Axion and Precision Physics Research (CAPP). The cavity resonant search, exploiting the coupling between axions and photons, explored the frequency (mass) range of 1.025\,GHz (4.24\,$\mu$eV) to 1.185\,GHz (4.91\,$\mu$eV). We have introduced a number of innovations in this field, demonstrating the practical approach of optimizing all the relevant parameters of axion haloscopes, extending presently available technology. The CAPP 12\,T magnet with an aperture of 320\,mm made of Nb$_3$Sn and NbTi superconductors surrounding a 37-liter ultralight-weight copper cavity is expected to convert DFSZ axions into approximately $10^2$ microwave photons per second. A powerful dilution refrigerator, capable of keeping the core system below 40\,mK, combined with quantum-noise limited readout electronics, achieved a total system noise of about 200\,mK or below, which corresponds to a background of roughly $4\times 10^3$ photons per second within the axion bandwidth. The combination of all those improvements provides unprecedented search performance, imposing the most stringent exclusion limits on axionâphoton coupling in this frequency range to date. These results also suggest an experimental capability suitable for highly-sensitive searches for axion dark matter above 1\,GHz.</p>

<p>2024-02-20, <strong>General geometry realized by four-scalar model and application to $f(Q)$ gravity</strong>, G. G. L. Nashed et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12860v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.12860v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we propose a model including four scalar fields coupled with general gravity theories, which is a generalization of the two-scalar model proposed in Phys. Rev. D \textbf{103} (2021) no.4, 044055, where it has been shown that any given spherically symmetric static/time-dependent spacetime can be realized by using the two-scalar model. We show that by using the four-scalar model, we can construct a model that realizes any given spacetime as a solution even if the spacetime does not have a spherical symmetry or any other symmetry. We also show that by imposing constraints on the scalar fields by using the Lagrange multiplier fields, the scalar fields become non-dynamical and they do not propagate. This tells that there does not appear any sound which is usually generated by the density fluctuation of the fluid. In this sense, the model with the constraints is a most general extension of the mimetic theory in JHEP \textbf{11} (2013), 135, where there appears an effective dark matter. The dark matter is non-dynamical and it does not collapse even under gravitational force. Our model can be regarded as a general extension of any kind of fluid besides dark matter. We may consider the case that the potential of the scalar fields vanishes and the model becomes a non-linear $\sigma$ model. Then our formulation gives a mapping from the geometry of the spacetime to the geometry of the target space of the non-linear $\sigma$ model via gravity theory although the physical meaning has not been clear. We also consider the application of the model to $f(Q)$ gravity theory, which is based on a non-metricity tensor and $Q$ is a scalar quantity constructed from the non-metricity tensor. â¦</p>

<p>2024-02-20, <strong>Effective field theories for dark matter pairs in the early universe: center-of-mass recoil effects</strong>, Simone Biondini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12787v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.12787v1</a></p>

<p>For non-relativistic thermal dark matter, close-to-threshold effects largely dominate the evolution of the number density for most of the times after thermal freeze-out, and hence affect the cosmological relic density. A precise evaluation of the relevant interaction rates in a thermal medium representing the early universe includes accounting for the relative motion of the dark matter particles and the thermal medium. We consider a model of dark fermions interacting with a plasma of dark gauge bosons, which is equivalent to thermal QED. The temperature is taken to be smaller than the dark fermion mass and the inverse of the typical size of the dark fermion-antifermion bound states, which allows for the use of non-relativistic effective field theories. For the annihilation cross section, bound-state formation cross section, bound-state dissociation width and bound-state transition width of dark matter fermion-antifermion pairs, we compute the leading recoil effects in the reference frame of both the plasma and the center-of-mass of the fermion-antifermion pair. We explicitly verify the Lorentz transformations among these quantities. We evaluate the impact of the recoil corrections on the dark matter energy density. Our results can be directly applied to account for the relative motion of quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy-ion collisions. They may be also used to precisely assess thermal effects in atomic clocks based on atomic transitions; the present work provides a first field theory derivation of time dilation for these processes in vacuum and in a medium.</p>

<p>2024-02-20, <strong>On the Contribution of Very Massive Stars to the Sulfur Abundance in Star-Forming Galaxies: the Role of PISN</strong>, S. Goswami et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13240v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.13240v1</a></p>

<p>Recent work presented increasing evidence of high, non-constant S/O abundance ratios observed in star-forming metal-poor galaxies, showing deviations from the constant canonical S/O across a large range of O/H abundance. Similar peculiar high Fe/O ratios have been also recently detected. We investigate whether these high S/O ratios at low metallicities could be explained taking into consideration the process of Pair Instability Supernovae (PISN) in chemical modelling through which similar behaviour observed for Fe/O ratios was successfully reproduced. We use chemical evolution models which take into account the stages of PISN in the yields published by Goswami et al. 2022, and adopt a suitable initial mass function (IMF) to characterize this evolutionary stage .appropriately. The peculiar high values and the behaviour of the observed S/O versus O/H relation can be reproduced when the ejecta of very massive stars that go through the process of PISN are taken into account. Additionally, a bi-modal top-heavy IMF and an initial strong burst of star formation are required to attain the reported high S/O values. We show that the role of very massive stars going through the process of PISN should be taken into account when explaining the chemical enrichment of sulfur and oxygen in metal-poor star-forming regions.</p>

<p>2024-02-20, <strong>Towards a new model-independent calibration of Gamma-Ray Bursts</strong>, Arianna Favale et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13115v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.13115v1</a></p>

<p>Current data on baryon acoustic oscillations and Supernovae of Type Ia cover up to $z\sim2.5$. These low-$z$ observations play a very important role in the determination of cosmological parameters and have been widely used to constrain the $\Lambda$CDM and models beyond the standard. To extend this investigation to higher redshifts, Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) stand out as one of the most promising observables since can probe the universe up to $z\sim9.4$. The use of GRB correlations is still a challenge due to the spread in their intrinsic properties. In this work, we propose an innovative and cosmology-independent method of calibration of the so-called 3D Dainotti correlation. We employ state-of-the-art data on Cosmic Chronometers (CCH) at $z\lesssim2$ and use the Gaussian Processes Bayesian reconstruction tool. To match the CCH redshift range, we select 20 long GRBs in $0.553 \leq z \leq 1.96$ from the Platinum sample, which consists of well-defined GRB plateau properties that obey the fundamental plane relation. To ensure the generality of our method, we verify that the choice of priors on the parameters of the Dainotti relation and the modelling of CCH uncertainties and covariance have negligible impact on our results. Moreover, we consider the case in which the redshift evolution of the physical features of the plane is accounted for. We find that the use of CCH allows us to identify a sub-sample of GRBs that adhere even more closely to the fundamental plane relation, with an intrinsic scatter of $\sigma_{int}=0.20^{+0.03}_{-0.05}$ obtained in this analysis when evolutionary effects are considered. In an epoch in which we strive to reduce uncertainties on the variables of the GRB correlations to tighten constraints on cosmological parameters, we have found a novel model-independent approach to pinpoint a sub-sample that can thus represent a valuable set of standardizable candles.</p>

<p>2024-02-20, <strong>A sequence of Type Ib, IIb, II-L, and II-P supernovae from binary-star progenitors of varying initial separation</strong>, Luc Dessart et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12977v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.12977v1</a></p>

<p>Over the last decade, evidence has accumulated that massive stars do not typically evolve in isolation but instead follow a tumultuous journey with a companion star on their way to core collapse. While Roche-lobe overflow appears instrumental for the production of a large fraction of supernovae (SNe) of Type Ib and Ic, variations in the initial orbital period Pinit of massive interacting binaries may also produce a wide diversity of case B, BC, or C systems, with preSN stars endowed from minute to massive H-rich envelopes. Focusing here on the explosion of the primary, donor star, originally of 12.6Msun, we use radiation-hydrodynamics and NLTE time-dependent radiative transfer to document the gas and radiation properties of such SNe, covering from Type Ib, IIb, II-L to II-P. Variations in Pinit are the root cause behind the wide diversity of our SN light curves, with single-peak, double-peak, fast-declining or plateau-like morphologies in the V band. The different ejecta structures, expansion rates, and relative abundances (e.g., H, He, 56Ni) are conducive to much diversity in spectral line shapes (absorption vs emission strength, width) and evolution. We emphasize that Halpha is a key tracer of these modulations, and that HeI7065 is an enduring optical diagnostic for the presence of He. Our grid of simulations fare well against representative SNe Ib, IIb, and IIP SNe, but interaction with circumstellar material, which is ignored in this work, is likely at the origin of the tension between our Type IIL SN models and observations (e.g., SN2006Y). Remaining discrepancies in our model rise time to bolometric maximum call for a proper account of both small-scale and large-scale structures in core-collapse SN ejecta. Discrepant Type IIP SN models, with a large plateau brightness but small line widths, may be cured by adopting more compact red-supergiant star progenitors.</p>

<p>2024-02-20, <strong>Radio Continuum Study of the Large Magellanic Cloud Supernova Remnant Honeycomb Nebula</strong>, R. Z. E. Alsaberi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12725v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.12725v1</a></p>

<p>We present the first and deepest Australia Telescope Compact Array radio continuum images of the Honeycomb Nebula at 2000 and 5500 MHz solely from archival data. The resolutions of these images are 3.6 x 2.8 arcsec2 and 1.3 x 1.2 arcsec2 at 2000 and 5500 MHz. We find an average radio spectral index for the remnant of -0.76 +- 0.07. Polarisation maps at 5500 MHz reveal an average fractional polarisation of 25 +- 5% with a maximum value of 95 x 16. We estimate the equipartition field for Honeycomb Nebula of 48 +- 5 {\mu}G, with an estimated minimum energy of Emin = 3 x 1049 erg. The estimated surface brightness, {\Sigma}1 GHz , is 30 x 10-20 W m-2 Hz-1 sr-1; applying the {\Sigma}-D relation suggests this supernova remnant is expanding into a low-density environment. Finally, using Hi data, we can support the idea that the Honeycomb Nebula exploded inside a low-density wind cavity. We suggest that this remnant is likely to be between late free expansion stage and early Sedov phase of evolution and expanding into a low-density medium.</p>
