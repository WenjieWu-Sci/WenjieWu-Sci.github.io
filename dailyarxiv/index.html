<p>2025-12-04, <strong>Searching for new physics with $^{136}$Xe double beta decay spectrum in PandaX-4T</strong>, PandaX Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04849v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04849v1</a></p>

<p>The continuous spectrum of double beta decay ($ββ$) provides a sensitive probe to test the predictions of the Standard Model and to search for signatures of new physics beyond it. We present a comprehensive analysis of the $^{136}$Xe $ββ$ spectrum utilizing $37.8 \pm 0.6$ kg$\cdot$yr of $^{136}$Xe exposure from the PandaX-4T experiment. The analysis yields the most precise measurement to date of the $^{136}$Xe two-neutrino double beta decay ($2νββ$) half-life, $(2.14 \pm 0.05) \times 10^{21}$ years, the uncertainty of which is reduced by a factor of two compared to our previous result. We measure the parameter $ξ_{31}^{2ν}$, defined as the ratio between the subleading and leading components of the $^{136}$Xe $2νββ$ nuclear matrix element, to be $0.59^{+0.41}_{-0.38}$, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. We also search for Majoron-emitting modes of $^{136}$Xe $ββ$, establishing the most stringent limit for the spectral index $n=7$.</p>

<p>2025-12-04, <strong>Towards Baikal-Top: Feasibility study of an onshore detector system for the joint registration of EAS with Baikal-GVD</strong>, E. A. Kravchenko et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04549v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04549v1</a></p>

<p>We study the possibility of registering high-energy extensive air showers (EAS) by the onshore detector facility simultaneously with the trigger of the Baikal-GVD neutrino telescope. The location of the surface detector array on the shore of Lake Baikal is motivated by the fact that permanent placement of detectors on the surface of the lake is challenging. Within the given geometry, simultaneous registration is possible for EAS with a zenith angle of about 76 degrees within the limited solid angle. The corresponding inclined EAS are dominated by muons and significantly attenuated. The installation will make it possible to obtain an estimate of the number of high-energy muons in EAS. This, subsequently, would make it possible to verify EAS modeling and calculations of the atmospheric neutrino flux. The detector may also be used for cross-calibration of energy and direction measurements by the neutrino telescope. We use the CORSIKA program to simulate the registration of EAS on the shore close to the Baikal-GVD. The propagation of ultra-high energy muons produced by EAS through 3.5 km of water and their registration by Baikal-GVD is simulated using the PROPOSAL package. We calculate the minimal total area of the onshore detectors suitable for several cosmic ray energy thresholds, starting from 1 PeV. The report presents estimates of the number of events jointly registered by the onshore installation and the Baikal-GVD the EAS registration detector systems with different areas.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>Multimessenger Constraints on Supermassive Dark Stars and Their Black Hole Remnants</strong>, Marco Manno et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04061v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04061v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter (DM) annihilation can power the first generation of stars as long lived dark stars (DSs) that grow to supermassive scales $M_{\rm DS}\gtrsim 10^{5} M_{\odot}$ and eventually collapse into heavy black holes that could seed the supermassive black holes observed at high redshifts. We compute the diffuse electromagnetic emission from a cosmological population of such supermassive DSs and their black hole remnants, tracking the entire DS history and including thermal surface radiation, DM annihilation in adiabatically contracted halos as well as late-time emission from DM overdensity spikes around the resulting black holes. After accounting for photon attenuation, we find that DS related contributions can exceed the Fermi-LAT extragalactic $γ$-ray background for thermal relic annihilation cross-sections and DM masses below $\sim 1$ TeV. Our results constitute the first population integrated diffuse multimessenger constraints on supermassive DSs as progenitors of early black holes and demonstrate that diffuse photon and neutrino backgrounds offer a powerful and complementary avenue for probing the role of DM in the formation of the earliest massive structures.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>Discrete flavour and CP symmetries in light of JUNO and neutrino global fit</strong>, Gui-Jun Ding et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03809v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.03809v1</a></p>

<p>Working within the reference three-neutrino mixing framework, we confront the lepton mixing predictions derived using non-Abelian discrete flavour and CP symmetries with the firs JUNO data on the solar neutrino mixing parameters $\sin^2θ_{12}$ and with the results of the latest global neutrino data analysis. We focus on symmetry breaking patterns for which the lepton PMNS mixing matrix depends only on one or two free real parameters. Performing a comprehensive statistical analyses in each of the considered cases, we report the best fit values, the $3σ$ C.L. allowed ranges and the $χ^2$-distributions of the lepton mixing observables - the three mixing angles and the three CP-violation phases. We find that the JUNO measurements can disfavour or rule out a number of the mixing patterns associated with specific types of breakings of the discrete flavour and CP symmetries. The synergy of JUNO, DUNE and T2HK data can provide an exhaustive test of the considered approach to lepton mixing based on non-Abelian discrete lepton flavour symmetries combined with the CP symmetry.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>Trapped fireshell (halo) of photons and pairs around black-hole horizon: source for ultra-high-energy particles</strong>, She-Sheng Xue et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03702v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.03702v1</a></p>

<p>We study the Compton-rocket effect of multi-photon interacting with electrons in an opaque fireball (or fire spot) of photons and $e^-e^+$ pairs at temperature $T_γ\gg m_e$. We find the charged-particle acceleration and the avalanche runaway process, leading to a non-trivial probability of ultra-high-energy (UHE) electrons and protons, which subsequently produce very-high-energy (VHE) photons and neutrinos. We show such peculiar dynamics using the Gamma-Ray Burst central engine fireball, whose inner part inflows and forms a gravitationally trapped fireshell (halo) around a black hole. The halo is a metastable, cooling via UHE particle emissions and blackbody radiation. We calculate the UHE particle luminosity varying in time, and discuss the peculiar features of such produced UHE particles, which lead to VHE particles, in connection with possible numerical simulations, observations and experiments.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>Neutrino-dominated relativistic shocked accretion flow around rotating black hole: implications for short gamma-ray bursts</strong>, Amit Kumar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03447v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.03447v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the physical properties of the central engine powering gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), modelled as a stellar-mass black hole accreting via a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF). By solving the governing hydrodynamic equations, we obtain global transonic NDAF solutions featuring shock transitions and examine their role in powering GRB energetics. The NDAF solutions are explored over a broad range of black hole parameters, including its mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and spin ($a_{\rm k}$), and accretion rate ($\dot{M}$). We find that shocked NDAFs can naturally account for the observed diversity in GRB energy output. Incorporating results from numerical simulations of binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers, we estimate the remnant black hole mass and spin parameters for the predicted range of post-merger disk mass ($M_{\rm disk}$). Our analysis reveals that small-mass black holes with relatively low spin values can adequately reproduce the luminosities of short GRBs (SGRBs), whereas identical GRB luminosities can also be achieved for more massive black holes possessing higher spin values. Finally, we uncover a robust correlation between the black hole spin and disk mass such that $M_{\rm disk}$ decreases with increasing $a_{\rm k}$, remaining largely independent of the black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) powering GRBs.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>Conformal Holographic Dark Energy</strong>, Mario A. Rodríguez-Meza et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03411v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.03411v1</a></p>

<p>Recent results from the DESI collaboration suggest a preference for an evolving dark energy (DE) component rather than a cosmological constant, motivating the exploration of alternative models for the background expansion. These data also reveal tension in the inferred matter density parameter -lower in DESI and higher in Planck- as well as a neutrino mass posterior that approaches the lower bounds permitted by oscillation experiments. In this work, we propose and test a conformal holographic DE (CHDE) model in which the DE density depends on a power law of the conformal time, characterized by an exponent (n). This formulation introduces a single additional parameter relative to LambdaCDM and reduces to it in the limit n = 0. We confront the CHDE model with BAO, CMB, and supernova datasets, following the same combinations used by DESI, and perform parameter inference under both flat and non-flat cosmologies. Our analyses show that LambdaCDM is not favored as the best-fit model when using CMB data alone or in joint analyses including BAO and SNla, and it is disfavored at the 4.4 sigma level for non-flat model and 4.5 sigma for the flat model. We obtain consistent values of n= -0.28 to -0.32 with uncertainties less than +-0.1 across multiple data combinations. Similar to LambdaCDM, the CHDE model predicts a lower matter density when employing DESI data instead of Planck data. This, in turn, influences the neutrino mass constraints, yielding values close to the minimal allowed range. Despite these dataset-dependent tensions, both the flat and curved CHDE models remain compatible with neutrino mass constraints from terrestrial experiments and yield posterior distributions that peaks at positive values. This behavior avoids the issue encountered in the LambdaCDM model, where the posterior peaks at negative mass values.</p>

<p>2025-12-04, <strong>Sensitivity of Hongmeng 21cm experiment on scattering dark matter</strong>, Junsong Cang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05056v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.05056v1</a></p>

<p>Scattering between dark matter and baryon can cool intergalactic medium temperature and deepen the 21cm signal. Such interactions have been proposed to explain the unusually deep 21cm absorption signal reported by EDGES in 2018. This paper explores the potential to detect dark matter - baryon scattering with the Hongmeng project, an upcoming lunar orbiting satellite experiment dedicated to measuring global 21cm signal between redshifts $11-46$. We self-consistently forward-model the simulated sky temperature data, jointly varying both the astrophysical and foreground models. We show that even with a very conservative observational strategy in which the experiment only takes data when both the Earth and the Sun are shielded by the Moon, Hongmeng can tighten the current constraints on dark matter - baryon scattering cross-section $σ_0$ by a factor of 21 after the full mission which lasts for five years. The prospective upper limit on $σ_0$ can reach $4 \times 10^{-43} {\rm cm^2}$ for dark matter masses between 0.1 MeV and 0.4 GeV. Even after only one month of observation, a factor of 3 improvement relative to current $σ_0$ limits can be expected.</p>

<p>2025-12-04, <strong>Emergence of ER=EPR from non-local gravitational energy</strong>, Kimet Jusufi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05022v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.05022v1</a></p>

<p>We construct a class of wormhole geometries supported by the non-local gravitational self-energy that regularizes the particle and black-hole sectors of spacetime. Using this framework, inspired by T-duality, we show that two entangled particles (or particle-black-hole pairs) naturally source an Einstein-Rosen-type geometry in which the required violation of the strong energy condition arises from intrinsic quantum-gravity effects rather than from ad hoc exotic matter, which is matter that violates the null energy condition. We classify the resulting wormholes, analyze their horizons, throat structure and embedding properties, and we identify the exotic energy needed at the minimal surface. Imposing the ER=EPR requirement of non-traversability and the absence of a macroscopic throat, we find that only the zero-throat geometry is compatible with an entanglement-induced Einstein-Rosen bridge, providing a concrete realization of ER=EPR within a fully regular spacetime. Finally, we briefly discuss possible implications for microscopic ER networks from vacuum fluctuations, replica-wormhole interpretations of Hawking radiation, and possible links to entanglement-driven dark-energy scenarios.</p>

<p>2025-12-04, <strong>Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals Embedded in Dark Matter Halo II: Chaotic Imprints in Gravitational Waves</strong>, Surajit Das et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04848v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04848v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the imprints of chaos in gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals configuration, where a stellar massive object, confined in a harmonic potential, orbits a supermassive Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter halo. In our first paper [1], we demonstrated the system’s transition from non-chaotic to chaotic dynamics by analyzing Poincaré sections, orbital evolution, and Lyapunov exponents across different energies and dark matter halo parameters. In this work, we compute the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial object along different chaotic and non-chaotic orbits by implementing the numerical kludge scheme. We further perform a spectral analysis of the gravitational waveforms from such orbits. In particular, we show that when the system is in a chaotic state, the gravitational wave signals are characterized by broader frequency spectra with finite widths, enhanced amplitude and energy emission rate, distinctly differentiating them from the signals generated during the system’s non-chaotic state. Through recurrence analysis we also show that the time series of gravitational waveforms strain carry unique information on the motion of chaotic dynamics, which can be used to distinctly differentiate from non-chaotic to chaotic motion of the source. Furthermore, we discuss the potential detectability of these orbits for upcoming observatories like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, emphasizing the significant potential for detecting chaotic imprints in gravitational waves to substantially enhance our understanding of chaotic dynamics in black hole physics and the dark matter environments of galactic nuclei.</p>

<p>2025-12-04, <strong>Phase transitions on the dark side of the Gross-Neveu model</strong>, Gabriel Osiander Rein et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04626v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04626v1</a></p>

<p>Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions exhibits a continuous transition from gapless Dirac semimetal to the gapped quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator at a finite (attractive) coupling, at which the inversion and time-reversal symmetry become spontaneously broken, and the flavor O($M$) symmetry remains preserved. A unification of leading order parameters of 2+1 dimensional $N$ four-component Dirac fermions collects all Lorentz-singlet mass-like fermion bilinears, except the one condensing in the QAH state, into an irreducible representation of the O($M=4N$), and predicts another phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model to occur at a strong (repulsive) coupling. Here, a fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed in order to study a lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where the sign problem is absent. We indeed find the O($4N$) symmetry breaking transition out of Dirac semimetal to occur and to be weakly first-order for $N=2$, relevant to graphene. The size of the discontinuity and the magnitude of the critical coupling, however, both grow with $N$. Adding a finite chemical potential is found to break the symmetry and cause superconductivity. These results are in broad agreement with the predictions of the unified field theory. Our lattice model also displays an interesting exact O($2N$) symmetry, a subgroup of the low-energy O($4N$), and has the ordered ground state with the order parameter that belongs to its $N(2N-1)$-dimensional representation. Other order parameters are also examined, and a certain hierarchy among those that belong to different representations of the exact $O(2N)$ is observed.</p>

<p>2025-12-04, <strong>Linear stability of nonrelativistic Proca stars</strong>, Emmanuel Chávez Nambo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04376v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04376v1</a></p>

<p>We study the linear stability of nonrelativistic Proca stars under generic perturbations. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods, we demonstrate that, as expected, the ground state is always mode-stable. Additionally, we identify several mode-stable spherically symmetric excited states, including stationary states of constant and radial polarization, as well as multi-frequency states in case that the spin-spin selfinteraction vanishes. The existence of stable excited states may have implications for spin-$1$ ultralight dark matter models.</p>

<p>2025-12-04, <strong>ELG$\times$LRG distribution through dark matter halo dynamics</strong>, Ginevra Favole et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04362v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04362v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the clustering and halo occupation distribution (HOD) of DESI Y1 emission-line (ELGs) and luminous red (LRGs) galaxies at $0.8&lt;z&lt;1.1$, including their cross-correlation (ELG$\times$LRG), using the AbacusSummit suite and a new Halo Occupation Model (HOMe) for galaxy multi-tracers. This integrates intra-halo dynamics, halo exclusion, and quenching, bridging insights from hydrodynamical, HOD, abundance-matching, and semi-analytic studies. Leveraging full phase-space information from the Uchuu N-body simulation, and sampling satellites from dark-matter particle positions via physically motivated prescriptions, HOMe reproduces the anisotropic clustering down to $s=200\,h^{-1}$kpc with unprecedented accuracy. Model parameters are inferred solely from two-point statistics using a two-level Bayesian framework, yielding high-fidelity ELG, LRG and cross-reference catalogs. We find that satellite ELGs behave as incoherent flows within their parent halos, dominating the clustering below $4\,h^{-1}$Mpc. The HOD from the best-fit HOMe has the following properties: (i) 90.50% (85.91%) of ELGs (LRGs) are central galaxies without satellites, residing in halos of $M_{\rm vir}\sim6.6\times10^{11}\,(1.2\times10^{13})\,h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$; (ii) the ELG$\times$LRG cross-correlation is governed by central-central pairs and shaped by halo exclusion on $2-5\,h^{-1}$Mpc scales; (iii) 9.50% (14.09%) of ELGs (LRGs) are satellites, of which 1.09% (3.52%) inhabit halos with a central galaxy of the same species in a maximally conformal configuration, 7.02% (0.005%) orbit complementary hosts in a minimally conformal state, and 0.58% (10.57%) are orphans. HOMe high sensitivity precisely captures the dynamics of satellites in different host environments, opening a promising avenue for understanding systematics, the dynamical nature of dark matter, potentially distinguishing gravity models.</p>

<p>We present 4,110 strong gravitational lens candidates, 3,887 of which are new discoveries, selected from a sample of 5,837,154 luminous red galaxies (LRGs) observed with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Candidates are identified via the presence of background ionized oxygen [O II] nebular emission lines in the foreground LRG spectra which may originate from the lensing of higher redshift star-forming galaxies. Using the measured foreground redshift, background redshift, and integrated flux of the background [O II] doublet, we integrate over impact parameters to compute the probability that each candidate is a lens. We expect 53% of candidates to be true lenses with Einstein radii ranging from 0.1’’ to 4’’, which can be confirmed with high-resolution imaging. Confirmed strong lenses from this sample will form a valuable cosmological dataset, as strong gravitational lensing is the only method to directly measure dark matter halo substructure at cosmological distances. We independently recover the host of the multiply imaged gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova iPTF16geu (Goobar et al. 2017). Monitoring these lenses for future multiply lensed transients will enable a) H0 measurements via time-delay cosmography and b) substructure measurements via flux ratios.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>Gravitational Waves from Isocurvature Perturbations of Spectator Scalar Fields</strong>, Marcos A. G. Garcia et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04240v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04240v1</a></p>

<p>We present a mechanism for gravitational wave (GW) production from isocurvature perturbations in spectator scalar fields during inflation. These energetically subdominant fields develop blue-tilted power spectra through inflationary dynamics, generating second-order scalar perturbations that source a stochastic GW background. The mechanism naturally satisfies CMB constraints at large scales while producing enhanced signals at smaller scales across a broad frequency range $10^{-20} - 1$ Hz. We perform comprehensive numerical and analytical calculations of the complete isocurvature spectrum evolution, including gravitational particle production, reheating dynamics, and scalar-induced GW generation. For spectator fields with effective masses $0.5 \lesssim m_{χ,\mathrm{eff}}/H_I$, the resulting GW energy density reaches $Ω_{\text{GW}} h^2 \sim 10^{-20}$-$10^{-12}$, accessible to pulsar timing arrays, space-based interferometers, and next-generation CMB experiments. Our analysis reveals that GW-induced constraints exceed current isocurvature bounds. We examine both unstable (curvaton-like) and stable (dark matter) spectator fields, demonstrating strong sensitivity to reheating temperature, inflaton-spectator coupling, and decay dynamics. This framework establishes isocurvature-sourced GWs as a powerful probe of early universe physics, enabling simultaneous constraints on inflationary dynamics, dark matter production, and reheating through coordinated multi-frequency GW observations.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>Z’ portal dark matter from post-inflationary reheating: WIMPs, FIMPs, and UFOs</strong>, Stephen E. Henrich et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04229v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04229v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the production of dark matter (DM) via a heavy $Z’$ mediator during the post-inflationary reheating epoch. In particular, we study production from three mechanisms which are smoothly connected to one another: WIMP-like freeze-out, FIMP-like freeze-in, and ultra-relativistic freeze-out (UFO). This is the first systematic study of $Z’$ portal DM which includes UFO. We find that much of the available parameter space for keV to TeV DM lies in the UFO regime for $ 1 \text{ TeV}\lesssim M_{Z’} \lesssim 1 \text{ PeV}$. When the mediator mass $M_{Z’}$ is greater than both the DM mass and the reheating temperature, UFO is a robust mechanism for producing cold DM. Although UFO DM is initially “hot” after freeze-out, it can easily become cold before structure formation if freeze-out occurs during post-inflationary reheating. Compared to standard freeze-in, UFO can accommodate significantly stronger interaction strengths (stronger couplings and/or smaller mediator masses).</p>

<p>Nucleon short-range correlations (SRCs) and their high-momentum tails (HMTs) encode key short-range dynamics in nuclei and dense matter. This review provides a concise overview of SRC features relevant to the Equation of State (EOS) of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. We summarize empirical and theoretical properties of the single-nucleon momentum distribution $n(k)$, emphasizing the role of the neutron–proton tensor force, the dominance of correlated np pairs, and the enhancement of minority-species HMTs. Links to nucleon effective E-masses, quasi-deuteron components, and orbital entanglement are briefly noted. We examine how SRC-induced HMTs modify kinetic and potential contributions to the EOS in both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks, including the softening of the kinetic symmetry energy and departures from the isospin parabolic approximation of asymmetric nuclear EOS. Sensitivity to high-momentum components and generalizations to arbitrary dimensions are also highlighted. Implications for heavy-ion reactions are summarized, including effects on particle yields, collective flows, deeply sub-threshold particle production and hard photon emission, driven by modified initial nucleon momentum distributions and abundant high relative-momentum np pairs during the reaction. Finally, we outline SRC-HMT consequences for neutron-star matter, covering proton fractions, tidal deformabilities, $Z$-factors, cooling, and the core–crust transition, as well as possible connections to dark-matter interactions in dense environments.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>A new connection between WIMP dark matter and the hierarchy problem</strong>, Maximilian Detering et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04158v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04158v1</a></p>

<p>This work proposes a direct link between the hierarchy problem and Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): we suggest that the small mass of the Higgs boson arises from being dynamically driven to the scale of the WIMP. Such a special electroweak vacuum is singled out by lying close to the critical boundary of a phase transition, as recently explored in a new class of cosmological solutions to the hierarchy problem. They generically predict the Higgs potential to be destabilised just above the weak scale. Intriguingly, the requirement for new physics to achieve this coincides with two independently well-motivated expectations: a split spectrum of light fermions and heavy bosons, as anticipated from naturalness, and the so-called “WIMP miracle”. A WIMP with mass around the weak scale not only happens to have the correct thermal relic abundance to be the dark matter (DM), it can also give rise to the necessary critical boundary at the TeV scale through its Yukawa couplings to the Higgs. We use a higgsino-like singlet-doublet model to illustrate our Higgs-DM criticality scenario and show that if this WIMP DM mass is observed to be greater than ~1.2 TeV then it necessarily implies a strong bound on the Higgs mass and an upper bound on the scale of heavy new physics that restores vacuum stability. It can be thoroughly probed in direct detection experiments, astrophysical signals and future collider searches, further motivating a comprehensive exploration of the remaining heavy WIMP parameter space.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>The DREAMS Project: Disentangling the Impact of Halo-to-Halo Variance and Baryonic Feedback on Milky Way Dark Matter Speed Distributions</strong>, Ethan Lilie et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04157v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04157v1</a></p>

<p>Direct detection experiments require information about the local dark matter speed distribution to produce constraints on dark matter candidates, or infer their properties in the event of a discovery. In this paper, we analyze how the uncertainty in the dark matter speed distribution near the Sun is affected by baryonic feedback, halo-to-halo variance, and halo mass. To do so, we harness the statistical power of the new DREAMS Cold Dark Matter simulation suite, which is comprised of 1024 zoom-in Milky Way-mass halos with varied initial conditions as well as cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Applying a normalizing flows emulator to these simulations, we find that the uncertainty in the local DM speed distribution is dominated by halo-to-halo variance and, to a lesser extent, uncertainty in host halo mass. Uncertainties in supernova and black hole feedback (from the IllustrisTNG model in this case) are negligible in comparison. Using the DREAMS suite, we present a state-of-the-art prediction for the DM speed distribution in the Milky Way. Although the Standard Halo Model is contained within the uncertainty of this prediction, individual galaxies may have distributions that differ from it. Lastly, we apply our DREAMS results to the XENON1T experiment and demonstrate that the astrophysical uncertainties are comparable to the experimental ones, solidifying previous results in the literature obtained with a smaller sample of simulated Milky Way-mass halos.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>Testing warm dark matter with kinematics of the smallest galaxies</strong>, M. Sten Delos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04156v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04156v1</a></p>

<p>Every dark matter halo forms with a $ρ\propto r^{-1.5}$ density cusp at its center. For warm dark matter (WDM), these prompt cusps can be massive enough to influence the kinematics of dwarf galaxies. By implementing prompt cusps in the Galacticus galaxy formation model, we show that the measured velocity dispersions of Tucana V and Triangulum II are serious outliers for dwarf galaxies arising in WDM models. For thermal-relic dark matter, the three faintest Milky Way satellites together constrain the particle mass to be $m_χ&gt;5.8$ keV at 95 percent confidence or $m_χ&gt;9.4$ keV at 90 percent confidence. Improved velocity dispersion measurements for these systems could greatly refine this constraint, as could identification and kinematic characterization of more such galaxies.</p>

<p>This manuscript endeavors to construct a pilgrim dark energy framework within the $f\mathbb{(Q,T)}$ gravity theory, employing a correspondence approach aligned with a non-interacting model that incorporates pressureless matter alongside a power-law scale factor. Here $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{T}$ represent the non-metricity and trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. This extended modified gravity framework accurately replicates various epochs in the cosmological history. The $f\mathbb{(Q,T)}$ gravity models are utilized to derive the equation of state parameter, phase planes and squared speed of sound. The analysis reveals that the reconstructed model exhibits an increasing or decreasing trend with the pilgrim dark energy parameter. The equation of state parameter characterizes the phantom regime, while the squared speed of sound parameter provides a stable framework for examining the ongoing cosmic evolution. The $ω_{DE}-ω’_{DE}$ plane trajectories reveal the freezing region, while the $r-s$ phase plane shows the Chaplygin gas model. It is important to highlight that our findings align with the most recent observational data.</p>

<p>Mock galaxy catalogues are often constructed from dark-matter-only simulations based on the galaxy-halo connection. Although modern mocks can reproduce galaxy clustering to some extent, the absence of baryons affects the spatial and kinematic distributions of galaxies in ways that remain insufficiently quantified. We compare the positions and velocities of satellite galaxies in the MTNG hydrodynamic simulation with those in its dark-matter-only counterpart, assessing how baryonic effects influence galaxy clustering and contrasting them with the impact of galaxy selection, i.e. the dependence of clustering on sample definition. Using merger trees from both runs, we track satellite subhaloes until they become centrals, allowing us to match systems even when their z=0 positions differ. We then compute positional and velocity offsets as functions of halo mass and distance from the halo centre, and use these to construct a subhalo catalogue from the dark-matter-only simulation that reproduces the galaxy distribution in the hydrodynamic run. Satellites in the hydrodynamic simulation lie 3-4% closer to halo centres than in the dark-matter-only case, with an offset that is nearly constant with halo mass and increases toward smaller radii. Satellite velocities are also systematically higher in the dark-matter-only run. At scales of 0.1 Mpc/h, these spatial and kinematic differences produce 10-20% variations in clustering amplitude -corresponding to 1-3$σ$ assuming DESI-like errors- though the impact decreases at larger scales. These baryonic effects are relevant for cosmological and lensing analyses and should be accounted for when building high-fidelity mocks. However, they remain smaller than the differences introduced by galaxy selection, which thus represents the dominant source of uncertainty when constructing mocks based on observable quantities.</p>

<p>In this work, we investigate tensor perturbations in a de Sitter background within the framework of Chern-Simons modified gravity. We introduce transverse-traceless perturbations and analyze how the Chern-Simons Cotton tensor induces parity-violating modifications to gravitational wave propagation, while the Pontryagin density vanishes at linear order. Using a mode decomposition of the scalar background field, we derive the sub- and super-horizon limits of the wave equations and uncover chiral corrections in the dispersion relations of tensor modes. The resulting birefringence exhibits both amplitude and velocity components, alternating with the phase of the scalar field. Particular solutions sourced by the scalar background show helicity-dependent amplification and a characteristic scaling of the radiated flux that reduces smoothly to the Minkowski limit. The accumulated phase difference between right- and left-handed modes grows quadratically inside the horizon and becomes frozen outside, leaving a permanent parity-violating imprint in the primordial tensor spectrum. Finally, by promoting the Chern-Simons field to a massive dark matter candidate, we demonstrate how its mass-dependent dynamics connect gravitational birefringence to axion-like dark matter phenomenology.</p>

<p>We study an extension of the Standard Model with a dark SU(2) gauge group, where a dark scalar doublet interacts with the Standard Model Higgs through a portal coupling, inducing mixing after symmetry breaking. A custodial symmetry ensures the stability of the dark gauge bosons, making them viable dark matter candidates. Scanning the parameter space of the model under collider and astrophysical constraints, we find regions that yield the observed relic density and strong first-order phase transitions. The resulting gravitational-wave signals fall within the reach of upcoming space-based detectors.</p>

<p>By solving a nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation in Kerr geometry, we uncover new phenomena and key characteristics of quantized vortices in quantum fluids near a Kerr black hole. The formation of these vortices induces rotational or turbulent flows, which profoundly alter the fluid properties and revise those dark matter models describing axion condensates, ultralight boson clouds, and other scalar fields in the vicinity of spinning black holes. As macroscopic, quantum, and topological defects, these vortices can stably orbit the black hole over extended periods, establishing their viability as novel probes for investigating black hole physics. For instance, we calculate the angular velocities of orbiting vortices to quantitatively characterize the frame-dragging effect, a classic prediction of general relativity. Additionally, we observe that relatively large vortices are accreted onto the black hole, wrapping around it while undergoing splitting and reconnecting processes. In quantum fluids with high vortex densities, turbulent flows emerge, accompanied by the formation of a vortex boundary layer near the event horizon. Beyond the ergosphere, we find vortex emissions and energetic outbursts, which may provide crucial insights into analogous astrophysical events recently discovered by the XRISM satellite.</p>

<p>Ultra-light bosonic dark matter (ULDM) is an interesting and promising dark matter candidate. While the wave-like nature of ULDM has been widely studied in the literature, we explore another distinctive feature of ULDM as Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) in this paper: the emergence of vortices in a rotating BEC-ULDM halos. Using numerical solution of the GPP equation, we demonstrate that a lattice of vortices ,underdensity columns that carry angular momentum, naturally forms in a ULDM halo under conditions similar to those of the Milky Way. Furthermore, we study the gravitational lensing by these vortices as a possible observational signature of BEC-ULDM. If the vortices are large enough and the halo’s rotational axis align with the line of sight, regularly separated brightness anomalies can be produced, providing strong evidence for BEC-ULDM.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>Forecasts for lifetime and fraction of Decaying Dark Matter based on redshift distortions from Euclid and BOSS</strong>, Javier Juárez-Jiménez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03348v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.03348v1</a></p>

<p>In this work we forecast constraints on models of decaying dark matter (DCDM) by using redshift-space-distortion (RSD) measurements implemented in a Fisher information matrix. In particular, we focus on the fraction of unstable dark matter, $α_{\mathrm{dcdm}}$ respect to the ordinary CDM component, and the decay rate, $Γ_{\mathrm{dcdm}}$ as the key parameters of the model. Fiducial values are derived from a MontePython MCMC analysis. The derivatives of the growth-related observable, $fσ_8(z)$ with respect to the parameters are numerically around the fiducial model. For the Fisher analysis, we employ mock data designed for upcoming surveys, particularly Euclid and BOSS, where RSD measurements yield constraints on $fσ_8.$ Our results show that when both stable and unstable components are allowed, constrains on the DCDM lifetime remain weak, with $τ_{\mathrm{dcdm}}&gt;1.18$ Gyr. In the limiting case of fully unstable dark matter ($α_{\mathrm{dcdm}}=1$), the uncertainty improves to $τ_{\mathrm{dcdm}}&gt;235.89$ Gyr. Our findings highlight the potential of RSD probes in testing and complementing decaying dark matter scenarios.</p>

<p>2025-12-04, <strong>Dust destruction by the supernova remnant forward shock in a turbulent interstellar medium</strong>, Tassilo Scheffler et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05046v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.05046v1</a></p>

<p>Context. While supernova remnants (SNRs) are observed to produce up to 1 M$_\odot$ of dust, the amount of dust destroyed by the forward shock (FS) is poorly constrained, raising the question whether they are net dust producers or destroyers. Aims. We aim to estimate the dust destruction efficiency of SNR FSs in a realistically turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) during their most destructive phase, and assess dust shielding by high density filaments during this period. Methods. We run 3D turbulence simulations for different turbulent Mach numbers (0-3) and average ISM densities (1-100 cm$^{-3}$) to resemble observations of the turbulent ISM. We then set off a supernova to trace its 3D magnetohydrodynamical evolution for 10 kyr. Finally, we run post-processing simulations to study the dust transport and destruction by the SNR FS, considering gas and plasma drag, kinetic and thermal sputtering, and grain-grain collisions, and either silicate or carbonaceous dust. Results. The dust destruction rate of the FS strongly depends on the average ISM density and turbulence strength, varying between 27-92% (0.85-11.0 M$_\odot$) in the studied 10 kyr. Overall, dust is less efficiently destroyed in a low density medium (1 cm$^{-3}$, 27-57%) than in intermediate (10 cm$^{-3}$, 46-92%) and high densities (100 cm$^{-3}$, 73-87%). The FS destroys 8-34% less dust in high Mach turbulence compared to a homogeneous medium. Furthermore, carbonaceous grains are more robust (up to 21% more) than silicates. Conclusions. Filaments can partly shield dust from destruction in the first 10 kyr, however, always more than 0.85 M$_\odot$ of dust is destroyed, making most SNRs dust sinks under the conditions explored in this work. The destruction efficiency of the SNRs with less than 1 M$_\odot$ of destroyed dust has not yet plateaued so that they are most likely also net dust destroyers by the end of their lifetime.</p>

<p>The distance to the Vela Junior supernova remnant (RX J0852.0-4622 or G266.2-1.2) has long remained uncertain, limiting our understanding of its physical properties. Using VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopy, we uncover chemical and kinematic connections between the nebula surrounding its Central Compact Object (CXOU J085201.4-461753) and the nearby Herbig-Haro outflow of Ve 7-27 (Wray 16-30), indicating a shared nitrogen-rich, Fe-peak-enhanced environment. This link ties stellar birth and death, with the young star Ve 7-27 embedded in material expelled by Vela Junior’s massive progenitor, and the remnant’s blast wave is expanding through the same medium. Adopting the Gaia-based distance to Ve 7-27, we revise Vela Junior’s distance to $1.41\pm0.14$ kpc. At this distance, the remnant’s physical radius is $23.3\pm2.3$ pc, and X-ray proper motions of the northwestern rim correspond to shock speeds of $(2.8\pm0.7)\times10^3$ to $(5.6\pm1.5)\times10^3$ km s$^{-1}$. These imply an age of $\sim$1.6-3.3 kyr and a very low ambient density, indicating that Vela Junior is expanding within a highly rarefied wind-blown cavity carved by a massive progenitor – consistent with the non-detection of strong thermal X-ray emission. This distance update also resolves long-standing inconsistencies, with major implications for its energy budget, particle acceleration efficiency, and compact object evolution.</p>

<p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s 10-Year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to produce a hundredfold increase in the number of transients we observe. However, there are insufficient spectroscopic resources to follow up on all of the wealth of targets that LSST will provide. As such it is necessary to be able to prioritise objects for followup observations or inclusion in sample studies based purely on their LSST photometry. We are particularly keen to identify tidal disruption events (TDEs) with LSST. TDEs are immensely useful for determining black hole parameters and probing our understanding of accretion physics. To assist in these efforts, we present the Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on the Observations of Real Nuclear transients (MALLORN) data set and the corresponding classifier challenge for identifying TDEs. MALLORN comprises 10178 simulated LSST light curves, constructed from real Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations of 64 TDEs, 727 nuclear supernovae and 1407 AGN with spectroscopic labels using Gaussian process fitting, empirically-motivated spectral energy distributions from SNCosmo and the baseline from the Rubin Survey Simulator. Our novel approach can be easily adapted to simulate transients for any photometric survey using observations from another, requiring only the limiting magnitudes and an estimate of the cadence of observations. The MALLORN Astronomical Classification Challenge, launched on Kaggle on 15/10/2025, will allow competitors to test their photometric classifiers on simulated LSST data to find TDEs and improve upon their capabilities prior to the start of LSST.</p>

<p>2025-12-04, <strong>Unveiling gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae with MUSE</strong>, Alessandro Veutro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04804v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04804v1</a></p>

<p>The core collapse of a massive star at the end of its life can give rise to one of the most powerful phenomena in the Universe. Because of violent mass motions that take place during the explosion, core-collapse supernovae have been considered a potential source of detectable gravitational waveforms for decades. However, their intrinsic stochasticity makes ineffective the use of modelled techniques such as matched filtering, forcing us to develop model independent technique to unveil their nature. In this work we present MUSE pipeline, which is based on a classification procedure of the time-frequency images using a Convolutional Neural Network. The network is trained on phenomenological waveforms that are built to mimic the main common features observed in numerical simulation. The method is finally tested on a representative 3D simulation catalog in the context of Einstein Telescope, a third generation GW telescope. Among the three detector geometries considered here, the 2L with a relative inclination of $45^\circ$ is the one achieving the best results, thus being able to detect a Kuroda2016-like waveform with an efficiency above $90\%$ at 50 kpc.</p>

<p>The elements in the universe are synthesized primarily in stars and supernovae, where nuclear fusion favors the production of even-Z elements. In contrast, odd-Z elements are less abundant and their yields are highly dependent on detailed stellar physics, making theoretical predictions of their cosmic abundance uncertain. In particular, the origin of odd-Z elements such as phosphorus (P), chlorine (Cl), and potassium (K), which are important for planet formation and life, is poorly understood. While the abundances of these elements in Milky Way stars are close to solar values, supernova explosion models systematically underestimate their production by up to an order of magnitude, indicating that key mechanisms for odd-Z nucleosynthesis are currently missing from theoretical models. Here we report the observation of P, Cl, and K in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A using high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM, with the detection of K at above the 6$σ$ level being the most significant finding. Supernova explosion models of normal massive stars cannot explain the element abundance pattern, especially the high abundances of Cl and K, while models that include stellar rotation, binary interactions or shell mergers agree closely with the observations. Our observations suggest that such stellar activity plays a significant role in supplying these elements to the universe.</p>

<p>2025-12-04, <strong>Mini-supernovae from white dwarf-neutron star mergers: Viewing-angle-dependent spectra and lightcurves</strong>, Yacheng Kang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04378v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04378v1</a></p>

<p>Unstable mass transfer may occur during white dwarf-neutron star (WD-NS) mergers, in which the WD can be tidally disrupted and form an accretion disk around the NS. Such an accretion disk can produce unbound wind ejecta, with synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mixed in. Numerical simulations reveal that this unbound ejecta should be strongly polar-dominated, which may cause the following radioactive-powered thermal transient to be viewing-angle-dependent. This issue has so far received limited investigation.   We investigate how the intrinsically non-spherical geometry of WD-NS wind ejecta affects the viewing-angle dependence of the thermal transients. Using a two-dimensional axisymmetric ejecta configuration and incorporating heating from the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, we employ a semi-analytical discretization scheme to simulate the observed viewing-angle-dependent photospheric evolution, as well as the resulting spectra and lightcurves. The observed photosphere evolves over time and depends strongly on the viewing angle: off-axis observers can see deeper, hotter inner layers of the ejecta and larger projected photospheric areas compared to on-axis observers. For a fiducial WD-NS merger producing 0.3 solar mass of ejecta and 0.01 solar mass of synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, the resulting peak optical absolute magnitudes of the transient span from ~ -12 mag along the polar direction to ~ -16 mag along the equatorial direction, corresponding to luminosities of $10^{40}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The typical peak timescales are expected to be 3-10 d. We for the first time explore the viewing-angle effect on WD-NS merger transients. Since their ejecta composition and energy sources resemble those of supernovae, yet WD-NS merger transients are dimmer and evolve more rapidly, we propose using “mini-supernovae” to describe the thermal emission following WD-NS mergers.</p>

<p>We investigate some cosmological implications at background level of the Bumblebee model. The phase-space, the critical points and their stability are analyzed in detail applying well-established dynamical system techniques. What is more, upon comparison to available supernovae data, the best fit numerical value of the unique free parameter of the model is determined. We show graphically all the cosmological quantities of interest versus red-shift, such as the deceleration parameter, dark energy equation of state parameter, etc. The statefinders and the age of the Universe are also computed. Finally, a comparison to the $Λ$-CDM model is made as well.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>The DESI Single Fiber Lens Search. I. Four Thousand Spectroscopically Selected Galaxy-Galaxy Gravitational Lens Candidates</strong>, Juliana S. M. Karp et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04275v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04275v1</a></p>

<p>We present 4,110 strong gravitational lens candidates, 3,887 of which are new discoveries, selected from a sample of 5,837,154 luminous red galaxies (LRGs) observed with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Candidates are identified via the presence of background ionized oxygen [O II] nebular emission lines in the foreground LRG spectra which may originate from the lensing of higher redshift star-forming galaxies. Using the measured foreground redshift, background redshift, and integrated flux of the background [O II] doublet, we integrate over impact parameters to compute the probability that each candidate is a lens. We expect 53% of candidates to be true lenses with Einstein radii ranging from 0.1’’ to 4’’, which can be confirmed with high-resolution imaging. Confirmed strong lenses from this sample will form a valuable cosmological dataset, as strong gravitational lensing is the only method to directly measure dark matter halo substructure at cosmological distances. We independently recover the host of the multiply imaged gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova iPTF16geu (Goobar et al. 2017). Monitoring these lenses for future multiply lensed transients will enable a) H0 measurements via time-delay cosmography and b) substructure measurements via flux ratios.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>Detecting light axions from supernovae in nearby galaxies</strong>, Francesca Lecce et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04185v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04185v1</a></p>

<p>Axion-like particles (ALPs) coupled to nucleons can be efficiently produced in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and then, if they couple to photons, convert into gamma rays in cosmic magnetic fields, generating short gamma-ray bursts. Though ALPs from a Galactic SN would induce an intense and easily detectable gamma-ray signal, such events are exceedingly rare. In contrast, a few SNe per year are expected in nearby galaxies within $\mathcal{O}(10)$ Mpc, where strong magnetic fields can enable more efficient ALP-photon conversions than in the Milky Way, offering a promising extragalactic target. This circumstance motivates full-sky gamma-ray monitoring, ideally combined with deci-hertz gravitational-wave detectors to enable time-triggered searches from nearby galaxies. We show that, under realistic conditions, a decade of coverage could reach sensitivities to ALP-photon coupling $g_{a γ} \gtrsim 10^{-16} \rm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-9} $ eV and assuming an ALP-nucleon coupling close to SN 1987A cooling bound. This sensitivity would allow one to probe a large, currently-unexplored region of the parameter space below the longstanding SN 1987A bound.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>The DREAMS Project: Disentangling the Impact of Halo-to-Halo Variance and Baryonic Feedback on Milky Way Dark Matter Speed Distributions</strong>, Ethan Lilie et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04157v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04157v1</a></p>

<p>Direct detection experiments require information about the local dark matter speed distribution to produce constraints on dark matter candidates, or infer their properties in the event of a discovery. In this paper, we analyze how the uncertainty in the dark matter speed distribution near the Sun is affected by baryonic feedback, halo-to-halo variance, and halo mass. To do so, we harness the statistical power of the new DREAMS Cold Dark Matter simulation suite, which is comprised of 1024 zoom-in Milky Way-mass halos with varied initial conditions as well as cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Applying a normalizing flows emulator to these simulations, we find that the uncertainty in the local DM speed distribution is dominated by halo-to-halo variance and, to a lesser extent, uncertainty in host halo mass. Uncertainties in supernova and black hole feedback (from the IllustrisTNG model in this case) are negligible in comparison. Using the DREAMS suite, we present a state-of-the-art prediction for the DM speed distribution in the Milky Way. Although the Standard Halo Model is contained within the uncertainty of this prediction, individual galaxies may have distributions that differ from it. Lastly, we apply our DREAMS results to the XENON1T experiment and demonstrate that the astrophysical uncertainties are comparable to the experimental ones, solidifying previous results in the literature obtained with a smaller sample of simulated Milky Way-mass halos.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>The evolutionary history of ultra-compact accreting binaries. I. Chemical abundances and formation channel of the eclipsing AM CVn system ZTF J225237.05-051917.4 from HST spectroscopy</strong>, W. Yu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04147v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04147v1</a></p>

<p>AM Canum Venaticorum (AM CVn) stars are ultra-compact binary systems composed of a white dwarf (WD) primary accreting from a H-deficient donor. They are important as potential progenitors of Type Ia supernovae and laboratories for gravitational-wave studies, yet their evolutionary history remains unsolved. Three formation channels have been proposed: the WD channel, the He-star channel, and the cataclysmic variable (CV) channel. We aim to provide the first accurate measurements of the fundamental parameters of the accretor in ZTFJ225237.05-051917.4, including the abundances of key elements such as C, N, and Si, by analysing UV spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. These measurements provide new insight into the system’s evolutionary history and establish it as a benchmark to develop our pipeline for application to a larger sample of AM CVns. We determine the binary parameters from photometric modelling and constrain the atmospheric parameters of the WD accretor, including Teff, logg, and chemical abundances, by fitting the UV spectrum with synthetic spectral models. We then infer the system’s formation channel by comparing our results with theoretical evolutionary models. We measure a Teff=23300$\pm$600K and a surface gravity of logg=8.4$\pm$0.3, which implies an accretor mass of 0.86$\pm$0.16 solar masses. We find a high N/C abundance ratio by mass of &gt;153. The accretor is significantly hotter than previous estimates based on simplified blackbody fits to the spectral energy distribution, underscoring the importance of detailed spectral modelling for determining accurate system parameters. Our results show that UV spectroscopy is well-suited to constraining the formation channels of AM CVn systems. We conclude that the He-star channel can be excluded based on the high N/C ratio, while the WD and CV channels remain consistent with the observations.</p>

<p>Recent analyses combining DESI DR2 BAO, Planck CMB, and Pantheon+ SNe have reported mild but intriguing deviations from the LambdaCDM model. A central challenge is to determine whether these deviations reflect genuine dynamical dark energy behavior or instead arise from cross-probe inconsistencies, prior choices, or mismatches in likelihood construction. Previous work demonstrated that imposing a biased supernova-motivated prior on Omega_{m0} can artificially displace the BAO-inferred w_0,w_a values from the LambdaCDM expectation. A complementary pedagogic study further showed that the differing degeneracy geometries of BAO, CMB, and SNe can generate apparent dark energy evolution even when the underlying cosmology is exactly LambdaCDM. In this manuscript, we develop a controlled tension injection framework that provides a systematic means of quantifying how probe-level tensions influence inferred dark energy parameters. Self-consistent BAO, CMB, and SNe mock datasets are augmented with parameterized shifts in (Omega_{m0}, H_0), supernova absolute calibration, and the BAO sound-horizon scale $r_d$. The resulting datasets are analyzed through a unified MCMC pipeline, enabling a direct assessment of how these controlled tensions propagate into biases in (w_0, w_a) and the pivot equation-of-state parameter w_p. This forecasting framework provides practical guidance for identifying probe combinations that are most susceptible to spurious signatures of dynamical dark energy, and helps ensure robust multi-probe inference in forthcoming precision surveys.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>Hydrogen-Rich to Stripped-Envelope:Observational Continuity and Biases in CCSNe</strong>, Anjasha Gangopadhyay et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04010v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.04010v1</a></p>

<p>Although historically classified into discrete subclasses, there is growing evidence that indicates that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) categories often overlap, reflecting continuous variations in progenitor structure, mass-loss history, and circumstellar environments rather than strictly distinct channels. In this review, we explore the proposed continua that link hydrogen-rich Type II SNe to stripped-envelope explosions (IIb-Ib-Ic), and that extend further into interaction-dominated and superluminous events. We discuss the physical processes-stellar winds, binary interaction, eruptive outbursts, and circumstellar interaction-that may produce graded outcomes across classes, while highlighting where observational evidence supports or challenges smooth transitions. We propose that CCSNe are better viewed as a multidimensional continuum of explosion outcomes, where traditional subclasses act as reference points rather than strict boundaries. Future progress will rely on large, homogeneous datasets and advanced modeling to disentangle true evolutionary sequences from apparent overlaps, ultimately connecting progenitor pathways to the observed diversity of explosions</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>Line Polarization of Si II $λ$6355 Å in Type Ia Supernovae: A New Statistical Approach to Probe the Explosion Physics and Diversity</strong>, Aleksandar Cikota et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03957v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.03957v1</a></p>

<p>Spectropolarimetry provides a unique probe of ejecta asphericities, offering direct insights into the underlying explosion physics of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We analyze the statistical properties of pre-maximum spectropolarimetric data for 24 SNe Ia observed with VLT/FORS, focusing on the Si II $λ$6355 Åline. Previous studies have revealed a correlation between the peak Si II polarization degree and the expansion velocity. Here, we combine these observations with multi-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer simulations. We consider two asphericity classes: (i) lopsided abundance distributions produced by off-center delayed-detonation transitions in near-$M_{Ch}$ white dwarfs or, for example, WD collisions (Class I), and (ii) global, axisymmetric density asphericities such as those arising from explosions of rapidly rotating WDs or mergers (Class II). Our model grid spans normal to subluminous SNe Ia and successfully reproduces the observed Si II velocity-polarization trend, with higher velocities associated with stronger asphericities. Consistent with observations, transitional SNe Ia and the faint end of the normal SNe Ia population show the highest Si II polarization and are best explained by Class I scenarios. In contrast, subluminous SNe Ia are dominated by Class II asphericities, characterized by lower Si II polarization but significant continuum polarization. The observed distribution of Si II polarization depends on both the observer’s viewing angle $θ$ and the intrinsic asphericity. Statistical analysis of these spectropolarimetric snapshots enables the separation of Class I and Class II contributions and highlights the intrinsic diversity among SNe Ia. Our results imply viewing-angle-dependent luminosities in our local sample, which may have implications when using high-redshift SNe Ia as evidence for the need of non-standard cosmology.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>The broad-lined Type Ic supernova 2020lao reveals an energetic explosion with no central-engine signatures</strong>, M. D. Stritzinger et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03716v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.03716v1</a></p>

<p>We present early-time observations of the broad-lined Type Ic supernova SN 2020lao, including optical spectroscopy beginning about 48 hr after the inferred explosion and extending to about 100 days. The explosion epoch is constrained with power-law fits to the rising TESS and ZTF light curves, with the first ZTF detection only about 27 hr after explosion. The optical light curves show a rapid 8.8 day rise and a peak luminosity typical of SNe Ic-BL (Mr=-18.5 mag). Unlike some engine-driven events, SN 2020lao shows no early optical excess or afterglow. The lack of a shock-cooling signature in the TESS/ZTF data constrains the progenitor to a compact Wolf Rayet-like star with radius of only a few solar radii. The spectra resemble those of the X-ray flash SN 2006aj but with higher velocities. Arnett modeling of the bolometric light curve, combined with Fe II velocities, yields a nickel mass of about 0.2 solar masses, an ejecta mass of about 3.2 solar masses, and a kinetic energy of about 23x10^51 erg, corresponding to a high specific kinetic energy of about 7x10^51 erg per solar mass. Spectral-synthesis modeling broadly reproduces the photospheric spectra and suggests a somewhat lower but still large specific kinetic energy (about 5 x 10^51 erg per solar mass). Although SN 2020lao and SN 2006aj produced similar 56Ni masses, SN 2020lao exhibits specific kinetic energies larger by a factor of several. Published VLA and Swift/XRT non-detections show no radio or X-ray afterglow, placing strong limits on relativistic ejecta and dense circumstellar material. Given its high specific kinetic energy, the absence of early excess emission and the radio/X-ray non-detections imply that any jet was either far off-axis or choked; otherwise, SN 2020lao represents an extreme non-relativistic SN Ic-BL.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>The ANDICAM-SOFI Near-infrared and Optical type Ia Supernova (ASNOS) sample: Description and data release</strong>, Kim Phan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03695v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.03695v1</a></p>

<p>Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide the most robust means of measuring extragalactic distances. While most of the effort has focused on increasing the number of SNe Ia observed in the optical, near-infrared (NIR) observations remain scarce despite their advantages, that is, reduced dust extinction and a more intrinsic standard candle behavior, requiring little to no empirical corrections. Here, we present ASNOS (ANDICAM-SOFI Near-infrared and Optical type Ia Supernova), a dataset with sample size of 1,482 epochs in the $BVRIYJH$ filters from the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3-meter SMARTS telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, along with 125 $JHK$ epochs from the SOFI instrument on the 3.58-meter New Technology Telescope on the La Silla Observatory. Additionally, we incorporate optical forced photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The sample comprises 41 SNe Ia in total, including 29 normal events, eight 1991T-like objects, and four peculiar subtypes, all located at redshifts $z &lt; 0.085$. This paper provides a detailed overview of the ASNOS sample selection, data reduction, SN photometry, host-galaxy spectral energy distribution construction, both global and local, and SN light-curve fitting using three methods: SALT3-NIR, SNooPy, and BayeSN. A companion paper will present the cosmological analysis.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>The helium common-envelope wind scenario for SN 2020eyj</strong>, Xiang-Cun Meng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03531v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.03531v1</a></p>

<p>SN 2020eyj is the first type Ia supernova (SN Ia) showing the signature of a compact helium-rich circumstellar material (CSM). Such a large CSM is difficult to explain in a single-degenerate scenario where the donor star is a helium star. Here we show that, under certain conditions, it is possible that the transfer of helium leads to a common envelope (CE) engulfing the system, similar to the common-envelope wind model proposed by Meng \&amp; Podsiadlowski (2017). If in such a helium common-envelope wind (HeCEW) model the initial white dwarf (WD) mass is larger than 1.1 $M_{\rm \odot}$ and the helium star more massive than 1.8 $M_{\rm \odot}$, the mass of a helium CE can be larger than 0.3 $M_{\rm \odot}$ prior to supernova explosion. The CE mass heavily depends on the initial parameters of the binary system. A dynamical CE ejection event could occur shortly before the supernova, and then our model may naturally explain the properties of SN 2020eyj, specifically the massive He-rich CSM, its dim peak brightness, low ejecta velocity and low birth rate.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>Radio Detection of a Local Little Red Dot</strong>, L. F. Rodriguez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03331v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.03331v1</a></p>

<p>Context. One of the most important discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the unexpected existence in the Early Universe (z &gt; 4) of very large quantities of “Little Red Dots” (LRDs), compact luminous red galaxies of intriguing physical properties. Aims. We wish to know if LRDs may host accreting Intermediate/Supermassive Black Holes (IMBHs/SMBHs) that may power LRDs, and compare them with the effect of clusters of massive stars. The spectrum of radio emission (synchrotron vs thermal) can be used to know which between these two types of energy sources is the dominant one. Methods. So far LRDs at high redshifts have not been detected at radio wavelengths and it is not known why. Assuming this could be due to their large distances and/or present limitations of observational capabilities, we analyze here archive Very Large Array radio observations of two analog candidates of LRDs in the Local Universe (LLRDs) at redshifts z = 0.1 - 0.2. Results. The LLRD source J1047+0739 at z = 0.1682 is detected at 6.0 GHz in 2018 with the VLA-A of NRAO as a compact source with radii less than 0.2 arc sec (&lt; 600 pc at d = 700 Mpc). Its flux density was 117$\pm$8 $μ$Jy and its spectral index was -0.85, which is typical of optically-thin synchrotron emission. It is also detected at 5.0 GHz in 2010 with the VLA-C, showing a flux density of 43$\pm$3 $μ$Jy. Conclusions. The observed flux densities can be provided by a radio luminous supernova. The increase in flux density over eight years can be explained as the result of two independent supernovae or as the radio re-brightening of a single one. Radio time monitoring of this and other LLRDs could help clarify the mystery of the radio silence of its cosmological counterparts.</p>

<p>2025-12-03, <strong>Push-broom Mapping of Galaxies and Supernova Remnants with the SPRITE CubeSat</strong>, Elena Carlson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03329v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.03329v1</a></p>

<p>Supernovae (SNe) enrich and energize the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) and are a key mechanism in the galaxy feedback cycle. The heating of the ISM by supernova shocks, and its subsequent cooling is critical to future star formation. The cooling of the diffuse shock-heated ISM is dominated by ultraviolet (UV) emission lines. These cooling regions and interfaces have complex spatial structure on sub-parsec scales. Mapping this cooling process is essential to understanding the feedback cycle of galaxies, a major goal of the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey. The Supernova remnants and Proxies for ReIonization Testbed Experiment (SPRITE) CubeSat Mission will house the first long-slit orbital spectrograph with sub-arcminute angular resolution covering far ultraviolet wavelengths (FUV; 1000 - 1750 angstroms) and access to the Lyman UV (lambda &lt; 1216 angstroms). SPRITE aims to provide new insights into the stellar feedback that drives galaxy evolution by mapping key FUV emission lines at the interaction lines between supernova remnants (SNRs) and the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). SPRITE will also measure the ionizing escape from approximately 50 low-redshift (0.16 &lt; z &lt; 0.4) star-forming galaxies. Current models predict SPRITE capable of detecting strong O VI, O IV], and C IV emission lines with angular resolution from 10 - 20 arcseconds. The SPRITE SNR survey will use push-broom mapping of its long-slit on extended sources to produce the first large sample of sub-arcminute 3D data cubes of extended sources in the FUV. In this paper, we present simulated SPRITE observations of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) SNRs to demonstrate the efficacy of the SPRITE instrument ahead of launch and instrument commissioning. These models serve as critical planning tools and incorporate the final pre-flight predicted performance of the instrument and the early extended source data reduction pipeline.</p>
