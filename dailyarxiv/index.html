<p>2026-01-15, <strong>Multimessenger Prospects for Low-Luminosity Gamma-Ray Bursts: Joint Neutrino and X-Ray Observations</strong>, Wenkang Lian et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10317v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.10317v1</a></p>

<p>Low–luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LLGRBs) are promising candidates for high-energy neutrinos, yet no coincident neutrino events have been detected so far. Recent advances in X-ray time-domain astronomy, together with the development of next-generation neutrino telescopes, open new opportunities for joint X-ray and neutrino observations of these transients. We calculate the jet dynamical evolution and the associated neutrino production for both non-magnetized and magnetized outflows. For individual events, joint X-ray and neutrino detection is generally limited to nearby LLGRBs or sources with high luminosities. Thus, we consider a next-generation neutrino telescope with an effective area enhanced by a factor of $\sim30$ relative to IceCube. In the non-magnetized scenario, joint detection of individual events is enabled for sources with typical isotropic luminosities of $L_{\mathrm{iso}}\sim10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ out to luminosity distances of $D_L\sim1.6\times10^{2}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $1$ per year. In contrast, for the magnetized scenario at the same luminosity, the accessible distance is significantly reduced, with joint observations confined to sources within $D_L\sim6.5\times10^{1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and an expected detection rate of order $0.5$ per year. For stacked samples of $\sim100$ magnetized LLGRBs, stacking substantially enlarges the accessible distance range, enabling joint observations for sources with representative luminosities of $L_{\mathrm{iso}}\sim1\times10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ out to $D_L\lesssim7.0\times10^{2}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $2$ per year. These results demonstrate that joint X-ray and next-generation neutrino observations enable a practical multimessenger probe of LLGRBs.</p>

<p>2026-01-15, <strong>Revealing Neutrino Mass Ordering at CEPC and FCC-ee</strong>, Wei Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10311v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.10311v1</a></p>

<p>The neutrino masses ordering remains one of the most important open questions in neutrino physics. While upcoming oscillation experiments aim to resolve this problem at low energies, complementary approaches are highly desirable. In this Letter, we show that the neutrino mass ordering can be probed at high-energy colliders through the lepton-flavor structure of heavy neutral lepton (HNL) interactions. In the minimal Type-I seesaw scenario with two nearly degenerate HNLs, the heavy–light neutrino mixings are strongly correlated with the light-neutrino mass spectrum, leading to distinct flavor patterns for the normal and inverted hierarchies. We demonstrate that future $Z$ factories, such as CEPC and FCC-ee, can probe the neutrino mass ordering for total HNL mixings as small as $U_{\rm tot}^2 \gtrsim 4 \times 10^{-9}$, and discriminate between the two hierarchies for $U_{\rm tot}^2 \gtrsim 10^{-6}$. Our results establish collider searches for HNLs as a powerful and complementary probe of the neutrino mass ordering.</p>

<p>In this proceedings we explore the physics potential of the ESSnuSBplus setup to study beam and non-beam based physics scenarios in both standard and new physics cases. The ESSnuSBplus setup consists of three neutrino sources: the main ESS linac, a low energy monitored neutrino beam and a low energy nuSTORM facility and three detectors: the main far detector and two near detectors. The goal of this facility is to measure the leptonic CP phase with extremely high precision and the neutrino nucleus cross-section in the few hundred MeV region.</p>

<p>2026-01-15, <strong>Updated Results for Kinematic Factors in Double Beta Decays</strong>, S. Ghinescu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10247v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.10247v1</a></p>

<p>Accurate calculations of phase space factors (PSFs), electron energy spectra and angular correlations are essential for designing and interpreting double-beta decay (DBD) experiments. These quantities help maximize sensitivity to potential signals, distinguish between different decay modes and interpret the data. In this work we provide updated results for these kinematic factors for two-neutrino ($2νββ$) and neutrinoless ($0νββ$) decay modes, including electron-emission, positron-emission and electron capture transitions. The calculations are performed with an adapted Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater method which allows for orthogonality of the wave functions of electrons and positrons in bound and continuum states and incorporates relevant atomic features such us screening, finite nuclear size, exchange corrections and phase shift effects. We provide tables with updated PSFs calculated both in the closure approximation and using the Taylor expansion method, for a large number of DBD isotopes. We discuss the impact of individual atomic corrections and find that our results are in line with predictions reported in recent literature. In some specific cases we find differences between our PSF values and those previously reported which are worth considering for better prediction and interpretation of DBD data. Then, we provide numerical values for $^{76}\text{Ge}$, $^{100}\text{Mo}$, $^{130}\text{Te}$ and $^{136}\text{Xe}$, which are most investigated in current DBD experiments. Similar data for other isotopes are available upon request.</p>

<p>2026-01-15, <strong>Dirac mass matrix textures and the lightest right-handed neutrino mass scale in Type I seesaw leptogenesis</strong>, Shuta Kosuge et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10063v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.10063v1</a></p>

<p>The type I seesaw mechanism is one of the leading proposed explanations for how neutrinos acquire their tiny masses. However, the mass scale of the undiscovered right-handed neutrinos required by this mechanism remains undetermined. Assuming vanilla leptogenesis in the two-flavor regime, we work backwards to find the required general textures of the Dirac mass matrix from which we determine the mass of the lightest right-handed neutrino to be around $10^9 {\rm GeV}$ to $10^{12} {\rm GeV}$.</p>

<p>2026-01-14, <strong>Lessons from the first JUNO results</strong>, Ivan Esteban et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09791v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.09791v1</a></p>

<p>First results from the JUNO reactor neutrino experiment already determine with world-leading precision the small neutrino squared-mass splitting $Δm^2_{21}$ and the mixing angle $θ_{12}$. In this article we perform an exploratory study beyond these, taking advantage of the first JUNO data release to discuss its sensitivity to the large squared-mass splitting, $Δm^2_{3\ell}$. When combined with constraints from global oscillation data, this may already contain some information on the neutrino mass ordering. Indeed, we find that the combination of the complementary $Δm^2_{3\ell}$-determinations gives a slight preference for Normal Ordering, with a p-value for Inverted Ordering of 2%-2.6% ($2.2σ$-$2.3σ$). We study the robustness of this result with respect to potential systematic uncertainties and statistical fluctuations. Taken at face value, a full global analysis of oscillation data including the publicly available JUNO information and data leads to a preference for Normal Ordering with $Δχ^2 = 4.6$ and 9.4 without and with Super-K and IceCube-24 atmospheric neutrino data, respectively.</p>

<p>2026-01-14, <strong>The Cosmic Neutrino Background is within Reach of Future Neutrino Telescopes</strong>, Gonzalo Herrera et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09790v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.09790v1</a></p>

<p>The cosmic neutrino background (C$ν$B) can be boosted to high energies due to scatterings with energetic cosmic rays (CRs) across cosmological scales. Previous calculations focused on neutral current incoherent and coherent elastic scatterings of cosmic-ray protons off relic neutrinos. However, charged current interactions and deep inelastic scatterings are also expected to occur, which enhances the boosted relic neutrino fluxes on Earth. Here, we compute the \textit{total} diffuse boosted cosmic neutrino background (DBC$ν$B) arising from CRs at all redshifts in the Universe, accounting for neutral current and charged current elastic and deep inelastic scatterings. We find that IceCube already places an upper limit on the cosmic neutrino background overdensity in cosmological scales of ~$\mathcal{O}(100-1000)$ at $E_ν=10^{10}$ GeV, for a lightest neutrino mass of $m_ν \gtrsim 0.1$ eV. We further show that IceCube-Gen2 could test $\mathcal{O}(1-10)$ C$ν$B overdensities, and the combination of $10$ future neutrino telescopes with similar sensitivity would allow us to test the $Λ$CDM expected C$ν$B density for a lightest neutrino mass compatible with the KATRIN bound.</p>

<p>2026-01-14, <strong>A New Constraint on the Optical Depth from the Reionization History Independent of CMB Large-Scale E-Mode Polarization</strong>, Yuta Kageura et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09644v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.09644v1</a></p>

<p>Recent studies report a mild discrepancy between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements within the $Λ$CDM framework. This discrepancy could be explained if the optical depth $τ$ inferred from the CMB large-scale E-mode polarization is underestimated, which may be biased by foreground-subtraction or instrumental systematics. In this work, we present a determination of $τ$ independent of the large-scale E-mode polarization, using the latest measurements of the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\mathrm{HI}(z)$, which is constrained by Lyman-$α$ forest and damping-wing absorption measurements at $z\sim5$-$14$, based on ground-based optical and JWST observations. Combining $x_\mathrm{HI}(z)$ with the Planck CMB power spectra excluding the large-scale E-mode polarization, we obtain $τ=0.0552^{+0.0019}_{-0.0026}$, a stringent constraint consistent with the previous CMB results including the large-scale E-mode. We also evaluate a potential systematic error in our method associated with absorption modeling, obtaining $τ=0.0552^{+0.0075}_{-0.0049}$. Using this constraint on $τ$, we resolve the degeneracy in the $τ$-$Ω_m$ plane and find a $2.4σ$ tension with the DESI DR2 BAO results, thereby confirming the claimed mild discrepancy suggestive of physics beyond $Λ$CDM. Finally, we derive an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $Σm_ν&lt;0.0550\,(0.0717)$ eV at the 95% (99%) confidence level. This limit favors the normal mass ordering and, when combined with the lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments, yields a further constraint, $Σm_ν=0.0594_{-0.0007}^{+0.0113}$ eV. However, the cosmological upper limit and the oscillation-based lower limit show a mild $2.2σ$ tension, providing an independent indication of possible physics beyond $Λ$CDM.</p>

<p>2026-01-14, <strong>New modular fixed point models and their phenomenological implications for JUNO, T2HK and DUNE</strong>, Er-Hao Shang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09598v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.09598v1</a></p>

<p>We perform a general analysis of minimal modular fixed point models based on two right-handed neutrinos (2RHNs) and three modular fixed points, and find that the only viable possibilities are based on modular $S_4’$ and $A_5$ symmetry. Such models are highly predictive, with neutrino masses and the lepton mixing mixing matrix being fixed by three real parameters, as in the Littlest Seesaw Models. We perform an exhaustive scan over all possible models in this class and find many viable fixed points and modular form alignments, after confronting them with the latest neutrino oscillation global fits. The resulting models have the new feature that the two Dirac columns take more general forms than traditional Littlest Seesaw models, resulting in new sum rule relations between the solar and reactor angles, beyond those associated with TM1 (where the first column of the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix is preserved), which are compared to present and future projected JUNO results. We also compare the predictions of these models for the atmospheric angle and CP violating phase to current global fits and future T2HK and DUNE sensitivities.</p>

<p>2026-01-14, <strong>Light neutrinophilic WIMP in the $U(1)_{\rm B-L+xY}$ model</strong>, Tatsuya Aonashi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09310v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.09310v1</a></p>

<p>Sub-GeV dark matter is an appealing thermal target because it can still be produced via the standard freeze-out mechanism; at such low masses, achieving freeze-out naturally points to the presence of a light mediator, which shifts the most promising discovery avenues from the energy frontier to the intensity frontier. Realizing this picture is nonetheless challenging, since CMB observations tightly constrain energy injection from dark-matter annihilation at recombination and therefore strongly disfavor simple $s$-wave annihilation into visible Standard-Model final states. In this work, we propose a concrete neutrinophilic framework for sub-GeV thermal dark matter (‘‘light WIMPs’’) based on an additional gauge symmetry $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{B}-\mathrm{L}+x\mathrm{Y}}$; for an appropriate choice of $x$, the new gauge boson couples predominantly to dark matter and neutrinos while its couplings to charged leptons are suppressed, so that sub-GeV dark matter annihilates almost exclusively into neutrinos, with hadronic modes kinematically closed. We map the parameter space in which the observed relic abundance is reproduced via standard thermal freeze-out in a conventional cosmological history, and show that sizable regions remain viable after imposing current cosmological, indirect-detection, and terrestrial constraints; in part of the allowed parameter space, the dark matter also exhibits sufficiently large self-interactions to potentially alleviate small-scale structure tensions.</p>

<p>2026-01-14, <strong>Spontaneous Cogensis by QCD axion in Type I Seesaw</strong>, Eung Jin Chun et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09224v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.09224v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a generic axion–driven cogenesis scenario in which both the baryon asymmetry and dark matter abundance originate from the kinetic misalignment. The framework unifies the Peccei–Quinn (PQ) mechanism with a Type–I seesaw sector, where Hubble–induced masses and higher-dimensional PQ–violating operators drive early–time axion rotation. Working within the DFSZ axion model augmented by heavy neutrinos, we identify the parametric window of right-handed neutrino masses, determined by its decay rate, and the range of Hubble scales compatible with successful cogenesis, while maintaining the axion solution to the strong CP problem and satisfying current limits on axion isocurvature perturbations. Our results establish kinetic axion misalignment as a robust and predictive mechanism for axion cogenesis, independent of the inflationary microphysics.</p>

<p>2026-01-14, <strong>Heavy Neutrinos across the Electroweak-to-Multi-TeV Frontier via Novel ML-Enhanced Probes</strong>, Yin-Fa Shen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09095v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.09095v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a new strategy to probe heavy neutrinos with non-universal fermion couplings at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) using a novel production mechanism and machine-learning algorithms. Focusing on proton–proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6~\mathrm{TeV}$, we investigate final states containing a charged lepton, missing transverse energy, and two jets. For heavy neutrino masses below $\mathcal{O}(1~\mathrm{TeV})$, production is dominated by the $s$ channel process. At higher masses, vector boson fusion becomes the dominant production mechanism, with cross sections that decrease slowly as the heavy neutrino mass increases. We simulate both signal and Standard Model background events and employ gradient-boosted decision trees to optimize event classification. Assuming an integrated luminosity of $3000~\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$, expected for the high-luminosity, and considering realistic statistical and systematic uncertainties, we find that heavy neutrinos in the mass range $50~\mathrm{GeV}$–$10~\mathrm{TeV}$ can be probed with sensitivity to the mixing parameter $|V_{\ell N}|^2$ spanning from $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ to 1. This approach enhances the discovery potential for heavy neutrinos and provides a complementary pathway to existing search strategies.</p>

<p>2026-01-15, <strong>Search for sub-GeV dark particles in $η\toπ^0+\rm{invisible}$ decay</strong>, BESIII Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10597v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.10597v1</a></p>

<p>Using (10087$\pm$44)$\times$10$^{6}$ $J/ψ$ events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider at the center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=3.097~\rm{GeV}$, we report the first search for $η\toπ^0S\toπ^0χ\barχ$ with $S$ denotes an on-shell dark scalar boson and $χ$ an invisible dark matter particle. No significant signals are observed with $S$ mass ranging from 0 to 400 $\rm{MeV}/c^2$. The upper limits on the branching fractions and the new physics coupling strengths between $S$ and quarks are set to be $(1.8\sim5.5)\times10^{-5}$ and $(1.3\sim3.2)\times10^{-5}$ at the 90% confidence level, respectively. The constraints on the dark-matter-nucleon scattering cross section is improved by approximately 5 orders of magnitude over previous dark-matter-nucleon scattering experiments, providing unique insights into sub-GeV dark matter.</p>

<p>2026-01-14, <strong>Constraining axion-like dark matter with a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer</strong>, A. Rigoulet et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09638v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.09638v2</a></p>

<p>We report on a broadband search for axion-like-particle (ALP) interactions using a radio-frequency-operated $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atomic magnetometer. The instrument provides wide spectral coverage and sensitivity to an oscillating pseudomagnetic field that may be generated by the gradient coupling of the ALP field to the constituent fermions of atoms. We search for an ALP-gradient signature in the mass range $2.40\times10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^{2}$–$2.11\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^{2}$. No statistically significant signatures of an oscillating magnetic field are observed, and we derive upper limits on the corresponding ALP-proton, -neutron and -electron couplings, $g_{αpp}$, $g_{αnn}$ and $g_{αee}$, respectively. The result on $g_{αpp}$ improves over previous laboratory searches, while the limits on $g_{αnn}$ and $g_{αee}$ complement earlier laboratory searches and astrophysical bounds. The work extends searches for ALP-fermion interactions into a mass region largely unexplored in a dark-matter context, demonstrating the potential of our method for broadband axion-like particle searches targeting the Galactic dark-matter halo.</p>

<p>Interference of the ultralight dark matter (ULDM) field generates time-varying gravitational potential fluctuations, which stochastically heat stellar systems embedded in ULDM halos. Small-sized stellar systems are therefore often used to set stringent constraints on ULDM. However, the evolution of systems with sizes well below the ULDM de Broglie wavelength remains poorly explored. Using numerical simulations, we show that the evolution of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos is governed by the interplay between internal stellar relaxation and ULDM-induced heating. We find the following main results. First, in sufficiently compact systems, relaxation-driven core collapse dominates, allowing the system to remain bound and dense, while ULDM-induced stripping of outer stars further accelerates the collapse. Second, in more extended systems, ULDM heating dominates and ultimately disrupts the system. Near the disruption threshold, we identify systems resembling ultra-faint dwarfs like Segue 1. Third, we further introduce a dimensionless parameter to quantify the relative importance of heating and relaxation and finally lead to an evolutionary phase diagram. Our results reveal the rich and nontrivial dynamics of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos, indicating that precise system modeling is essential for robust ULDM constraints.</p>

<p>2026-01-15, <strong>Direct Detection of Type II-P Supernova Progenitors with the Euclid and CSST Surveys</strong>, Junjie Wu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10121v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.10121v1</a></p>

<p>A central goal in supernova (SN) research is to identify and characterize their progenitors. However, this is very difficult due to the limited archival images with sufficient depth and spatial resolution required for direct progenitor detection and due to the circumstellar dust which often biases the estimate of their intrinsic parameters. This field will be revolutionized by Euclid and the upcoming Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST), which conduct deep, wide-field, high-resolution and multi-band imaging surveys. We analyze their detection capability by comparing the model magnitudes of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors with the detection limits under different conditions, and we estimate the annual detection rates with Monte-Carlo simulations. We explore how to recover the intrinsic properties of SN progenitors with the help of radiation transfer calculations in circumstellar dust. We find the optical and near-infrared filters of the Euclid and CSST are highly effective for detecting RSG progenitors. We predict that archival images from the completed 2 surveys will enable $\lesssim13$ (or 24) progenitor detections per year within the mass range of 8–16 (or 8–25)M_\odot, an order of magnitude higher than the current detection rate of $\sim1$ detection per year. In the presence of circumstellar dust, the emerging spectral energy distribution (SED) of the progenitor is mainly affected by the optical depth and is almost independent of dust temperature in the Euclid and CSST filters. Our mock tests demonstrate that one can derive the progenitor mass and dust optical depth simultaneously by fitting the observed SED over the 11 filters of the 2 surveys while fixing the dust temperature to a typical value. Euclid and CSST will significantly enlarge the sample of direct progenitor detections with accurate mass measurements, which is crucial to resolve the long-standing RSG problem.</p>

<p>2026-01-14, <strong>New Hard X-Ray and Multiwavelength Study of the PeVatron Candidate PWN G0.9+0.1 in the Galactic Center Region</strong>, Giulia Brunelli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09788v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.09788v1</a></p>

<p>We present a new X-ray study and multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of the young pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by the energetic pulsar PSR J1747-2809, inside the composite supernova remnant (SNR) G0.9+0.1, located in the Galactic Center region. The source is detected by NuSTAR up to 30 keV with evidence for the synchrotron burnoff effect in the changing spatial morphology with increasing energy. The broadband 2-30 keV spectrum of PWN G0.9+0.1 is modeled by a single power law with photon index $Γ=2.11\pm0.07$. We combined the new X-ray data with the multiwavelength observations in radio, GeV, and TeV gamma rays and modeled the SED, applying a one-zone and a multi-zone leptonic model. The comparison of the models is successful, as we obtained physically compatible results in the two cases. Through the one-zone model, we constrain the age of the system to $\sim2.2$ kyr, as well as reproduce the observed PWN and SNR radio sizes. In both the one-zone and multi-zone leptonic models, the electron injection spectrum is well-described by a single power law with spectral index $p \sim 2.6$ and a maximum electron energy of $\sim2$ PeV, suggesting the source could be a leptonic PeVatron candidate. We estimate the average magnetic field to be $B_{\rm PWN} \sim 20\ μ$G. We also report the serendipitous NuSTAR detection of renewed X-ray activity from the very faint X-ray transient XMMU J174716.1-281048 and characterize its spectrum.</p>

<p>2026-01-14, <strong>Blowouts of Nascent Wind Bubbles in Pulsar-Driven Supernovae</strong>, Mingxi Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09552v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.09552v1</a></p>

<p>Formation of a rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized neutron star (NS) may occur in various classes of core-collapse events. If the NS injects an amount of energy comparable to the explosion energy of the accompanying supernova (SN) before the SN ejecta becomes transparent, the nascent NS wind bubble can overtake the outer ejecta and undergo a blowout driven by hydrodynamic instabilities. Based on multidimensional numerical studies, we construct a minimal semi-analytic framework to follow the post-blowout dynamics and radiative evolution, map the blowout conditions by scanning the ejecta and NS parameters, and compute survey-ready multi-band light curves. For stripped-envelope SNe with an ejecta mass of $M_\mathrm{ej} \sim 10\,M_\odot$ and an explosion energy of $E_\mathrm{sn} \sim 10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}$, blowout occurs for NSs with magnetic field strengths of $B_{\mathrm{dip}} \gtrsim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{G}$ and spin periods of $P_\mathrm{NS} \lesssim \mathrm{a\ few}\,\mathrm{ms}$. Relatively weak-field cases with $B_\mathrm{dip} \lesssim 10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$ produce luminous double-peaked UV/optical light curves, as observed in the superluminous SN LSQ14bdq, while stronger-field cases with $B_\mathrm{dip} \gtrsim 10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$ result in hypernovae preceded by X-ray blowout precursors. We also examine weaker and lower-mass SN explosions representing ultra-stripped SNe and accretion- or merger-induced collapse events, in which blowout is more readily achieved over a broader range of NS parameters, producing fast X-ray transients with durations of $ 10^{2\mbox{–}4}\,\mathrm{s}$ and peak luminosities of $10^{42\mbox{–}48}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. Our results encourage coordinated UV, optical, and X-ray observations which constrain the formation of the most energetic NSs in the universe.</p>

<p>2026-01-14, <strong>Probing dynamical embeddings in a five-dimensional spacetime in light of DESI BAO</strong>, Abraão J. S. Capistrano et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09429v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.09429v1</a></p>

<p>We here investigate the observational viability of Nash gravity as an alternative to the standard $Λ$CDM cosmology. Based on Nash’s embedding theorem, the model introduces orthogonal perturbations via variations in the extrinsic curvature, generating scalar-type metric perturbations directly from geometry, without the need to introduce additional fields. We confront the model with current observational data, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements from Planck, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2, and recent Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) compilations. Our analysis shows that Nash gravity provides a good fit to the data, yielding a slightly higher value for the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 69.32 \pm 0.72$ km/s/Mpc, compared to the $Λ$CDM model, thus offering a potential alleviation of the $H_0$ tension. Furthermore, the model naturally predicts a suppressed growth of structure, with $S_8 \approx 0.76$ across various joint analyses, potentially alleviating the so-called $S_8$ tension, assuming that this discrepancy is not solely due to systematic effects in other independent measurements. In some cases, Nash gravity achieves a better fit to the data than the $Λ$CDM paradigm at the $2σ$ level.</p>

<p>2026-01-14, <strong>Chiellini-Integrable Cosmologies with Phantom Divide Crossing</strong>, Soumya Chakrabarti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09271v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.09271v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate exact cosmological solutions with a massive scalar field minimally coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert action in General Relativity. For an extended Higgs-like scalar self-interaction, we find that the resulting field equations belong to the damped Ermakov-Painlevé II class and construct novel analytical solutions within the framework of the Chiellini integrability condition. We analyze whether the expanding branch of the solutions can describe a late-time cosmic acceleration, using a combined statistical analysis of BAO, CMB, cosmic chronometer and Pantheon+SHOES supernova datasets. A crucial outcome of this exercise is the analytical emergence of a smooth phantom divide crossing in the dark energy equation of state, achieved without introducing any pathological instabilities. The reconstruction yields a present-day Hubble parameter $H_0 \gtrsim 70 \,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, with a reduced tension relative to the $Λ$CDM cosmology. The results indicate that Chiellini-integrable scalar cosmologies are capable of providing a robust and analytically controlled framework for modeling late-time cosmic acceleration and phantom divide crossing, offering a viable alternative to phenomenological dark-energy parametrizations.</p>

<p>2026-01-14, <strong>The Progenitor of the Type II-Plateau SN 2025pht in NGC 1637: The Dustiest, Most Luminous Red Supergiant So Far?</strong>, Schuyler D. Van Dyk et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09087v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.09087v1</a></p>

<p>We provide a characterization of the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor candidate for the nearby Type II-plateau supernova (SN) 2025pht in NGC 1637. The star was first detectable in 2001 by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and then again in a dozen bands by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2024. This “quasi-snapshot” of the star’s nature almost immediately prior to explosion is unprecedented. The RSG varied in brightness, and we posit that it could have been a pulsating variable, possibly with a long period of ~660 days. The largest uncertainty is the host-galaxy distance, which we establish to be 10.73+/-1.76 Mpc. The star was also heavily extinguished by interstellar dust internal to the host, with visual extinction A_V(host)~1.7 mag (total A_V(tot)~1.8 mag). Dust radiative-transfer modeling reveals the star’s circumstellar medium to be quite dusty and silicate-rich, yielding a bolometric luminosity log(L_bol/L_Sun)=5.08+/-0.16 and a cool effective temperature T_eff=2100–2500 K. The available HST optical data had no bearing on the shape of the candidate’s observed spectral energy distribution – for the first time, without the archival JWST observations we would not have been able to detect and characterize the candidate at all. The SN 2025pht progenitor candidate, although quite similar to that of SN 2023ixf, may be the most luminous candidate identified to date.</p>

<p>2026-01-14, <strong>Pre-Supernova Eruptions Triggered by Sudden Energy Deposition in Low-Mass Core-Collapse Supernova Progenitors</strong>, Shuai Zha et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09063v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.09063v1</a></p>

<p>In low-mass core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors, nuclear burning beyond oxygen can become explosive under degenerate conditions, triggering eruptive mass loss before the final explosion. We investigate such pre-SN eruptions using \texttt{SNEC} hydrodynamic simulations and realistic stellar models, parameterizing the nuclear energy deposition as a fraction of the binding energy of the combined He layer and H-rich envelope. For the lowest-mass model (9 $M_\odot$), the ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej}$) scales with the energy gained by the H-rich envelope via a power law (index$\sim$3.5). Across 9-10 $M_\odot$, this relation shows limited scatter within a factor of $\sim$2.6, enabling an estimation of the gained energy from $M_{\rm ej}$. The shock passage also flattens the bound envelope, which can affect the SN light curve morphology and provide another diagnostic for the eruption. Then, we compute the associated precursor light curves for the 9 $M_\odot$ model with the multi-group radiative-transfer code \texttt{STELLA}. These signals are typically faint, with bolometric luminosities of $\sim10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ lasting hundreds of days. Their cool black-body spectra make them brighter in the infrared, yet several magnitudes fainter than observed pre-SN precursors at the threshold for full envelope ejection. To aid future studies, we make our post-eruption stellar profiles and precursor light curves publicly available.</p>
