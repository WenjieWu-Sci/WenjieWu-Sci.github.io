<p>2023-08-01, <strong>Updated Trends in Neutrino-induced hadron production</strong>, Rashi Sharma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00511v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00511v1</a></p>

<p>With four different type of neutrino-induced interactions, we considered to investigate and reanalyse the KNO scaling in modified multiplicity distributions from a different perspective. In an attempt of first of its kind, we propose alternate fitting function to parameterise the distribution than the most widely adopted Slattery’s function and compare it with yet another form. We propose the shifted Gompertz and Weibull functions as the fitting functions and compare their potency for the most conventional form of Slattery’s function. In addition the analysis of the data by evaluating the central moments and factorial moments, we show the dependence of moments on the target size.</p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has discovered a diffuse neutrino flux of astrophysical origin and measures its properties in various detection channels. With more than 10 years of data, we use multiple data samples from different detection channels for a combined fit of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino spectrum. This leverages the complementary information of different neutrino event signatures. For the first time, we use a coherent modelling of the signal and background, as well as the detector response and corresponding systematic uncertainties. The detector response is continuously varied during the simulation in order to generate a general purpose Monte Carlo set, which is central to our approach. We present a combined fit yielding a measurement of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux properties with unprecedented precision.</p>

<p>2023-07-31, <strong>Deep Learning Based Event Reconstruction for the IceCube-Gen2 Radio Detector</strong>, Nils Heyer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00164v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00164v1</a></p>

<p>The planned in-ice radio array of IceCube-Gen2 at the South Pole will provide unprecedented sensitivity to ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos in the EeV range. The ability of the detector to measure the neutrino’s energy and direction is of crucial importance. This contribution presents an end-to-end reconstruction of both of these quantities for both detector components of the hybrid radio array (‘shallow’ and ‘deep’) using deep neural networks (DNNs). We are able to predict the neutrino’s direction and energy precisely for all event topologies, including the electron neutrino charged-current interactions, which are more complex due to the LPM effect. This highlights the advantages of DNNs for modeling the complex correlations in radio detector data, thereby enabling a measurement of the neutrino energy and direction. We discuss how we can use normalizing flows to predict the PDF for each individual event which allows modeling the complex non-Gaussian uncertainty contours of the reconstructed neutrino direction. Finally, we discuss how this work can be used to further optimize the detector layout to improve its reconstruction performance.</p>

<p>2023-07-31, <strong>From ray to spray: augmenting amplitudes and taming fast oscillations in fully numerical neutrino codes</strong>, Michele Maltoni et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00037v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00037v1</a></p>

<p>In this note we describe how to augment the neutrino evolution matrix calculated at a given energy and trajectory with additional information which allows to reliably extrapolate it to nearby energies or trajectories without repeating the full computation. Our method works for arbitrary matter density profiles, can be applied to any propagation model described by an Hamiltonian, and exactly guarantees the unitarity of the evolution matrix. As a straightforward application, we show how to enhance the calculation of the theoretical predictions for experimentally measured quantities, so that they remain accurate even in the presence of fast neutrino oscillations. We also provide a set of examples to illustrate the most prominent features of our approach.</p>

<p>2023-07-31, <strong>Searching for High-Energy Neutrino Emission from Seyfert Galaxies in the Northern Sky with IceCube</strong>, Theo Glauch et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00024v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00024v1</a></p>

<p>The recent detection of TeV neutrino emission from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068 by IceCube suggests that AGN could make a sizable contribution to the total high-energy cosmic neutrino flux. The absence of TeV gamma rays from NGC 1068, indicates neutrino production originates in the innermost region of the AGN. Disk-corona models predict a correlation between neutrinos and keV X-rays in Seyfert galaxies, a subclass of AGN to which NGC 1068 belongs. Using 10 years of IceCube through-going track events, we report results from searches for neutrino signals from 27 additional sources in the Northern Sky by studying both the generic single power-law spectral assumption and spectra predicted by the disk-corona model. Our results show excesses of neutrinos associated with two sources, NGC 4151 and CGCG 420-015, at 2.7$\sigma$ significance, and at the same time constrain the collective neutrino emission from our source list.</p>

<p>2023-07-31, <strong>Equilibration of quantum many-body fast neutrino flavor oscillations</strong>, Joshua D. Martin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16793v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.16793v1</a></p>

<p>In hot and dense astrophysical environments, neutrinos are emitted in such numbers that their flavor content is expected to have an appreciable effect on the local system’s dynamic and chemical evolution. In this work, we consider such a gas in the regime for which neutrino-neutrino coherent forward scattering dominates the flavor evolution. We show evidence that the generic potential induced by this effect is non-integrable and that the statistics of its energy level spaces are in good agreement with the Wigner surmise. We also find that individual neutrinos rapidly entangle with all of the others present which results in an equilibration of the flavor content of individual neutrinos. We show that the average neutrino flavor content can be predicted utilizing a thermodynamic partition function. A random phase approximation to the evolution gives a simple picture of this equilibration. In the case of neutrinos and antineutrinos, processes like $\nu_e {\bar{\nu}}_e \leftrightarrows \nu_\mu {\bar{\nu}_\mu} $ yield a rapid equilibrium satisfying $n( \nu_e) n({\bar \nu}_e) = n( \nu_\mu) n({\bar \nu}_\mu) = n( \nu_\tau) n({\bar \nu}_\tau)$ in addition to the standard lepton number conservation in regimes where off-diagonal vacuum oscillations are small compared to $\nu-\nu$ interactions.</p>

<p>2023-07-31, <strong>Estimating at Earth the Ultra-High Energy Neutrino Flux from the Accretion Disks in the Galactic Core</strong>, Ayshea Bains et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16698v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.16698v1</a></p>

<p>This research is to determine at Earth the high-energy neutrino flux coming from the galactic core, and from the many other accretion disks within the galactic core. It is estimated there are 10,000 such accretion disk within the cubic parsec of the galactic core alone and many more in the galactic core halo. There are various neutrino detectors, such as IceCube, which can detect energetic neutrinos. However, the direct galactic core neutrino flux is exceptionally low, so very few neutrinos from the galactic core are measured. We created two models to simulate the galactic core neutrino flux. To better estimate the neutrino flux we randomly distributed the accretion disks and generated bodies of varying sizes. This was then used to determine the ultra-high energy neutrino flux. Since it is extremely difficult to determine neutrino direction from interactions of neutrinos, we envision an application where the energetic galactic core neutrinos are gravitationally focused by the Sun with a large light collecting power of eleven to twelve orders of magnitude. They could interact in a planet’s atmosphere where the produced showers containing energetic charged particles can produce Cherenkov rings imageable by an orbiting spacecraft or upward going muons which can be observed in a cosmic ray experiment. Estimating the flux will provide a general approximation of the number of ultra-high energy neutrinos that should reach Earth, with Earth being the overall detector. Moreover, studying the neutrinos will provide more information on the conditions of the galactic region, and allow characterizations of it to be formed.</p>

<p>2023-07-31, <strong>Two Candidate Obscured Tidal Disruption Events Coincident with High-Energy Neutrinos</strong>, Ning Jiang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16667v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.16667v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, three optical tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) have been suggested to be coincident with high-energy neutrinos. They all exhibit unusually strong dust infrared (IR) echoes, with their peak times matching the neutrino arrival time even better than the optical peaks. We hereby report on two new TDE candidates that are spatially and temporally coincident with neutrinos by matching our sample of mid-infrared outbursts in nearby galaxies (MIRONG) with Gold alerts of IceCube high-energy neutrino events up to June 2022. The two candidates show negligible optical variability according to their ZTF light curves and can therefore be classified as part of the growing population of obscured TDE candidates. The chance probability of finding two such candidates about $\sim3\%$ by redistributing the MIRONG sources randomly in the SDSS footprint, which will be as low as $\sim0.1\%$ (or $\sim0.2\%$) if we limit to sources with increased fluxes (or variability amplitudes) comparable with the matched two sources. Our findings further support the potential connection between high-energy neutrinos and TDEs in dusty environments by increasing the total number of neutrino-associated TDE and TDE candidates to five, although the underlying physics remains poorly understood.</p>

<p>2023-07-31, <strong>The intelligent Photomultiplier Tubes for OSIRIS</strong>, Feng Gao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16569v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.16569v1</a></p>

<p>The dimensions of liquid scintillator neutrino detectors have grown over the years. Thus, the analog cable length required for the readout increases. In consequence, the signal loss increases as well. With the intelligent Photomultiplier Tube this problem can be solved. The digitiser is moved as close as possible to the Photomultiplier Tube. This concept allows nearly lossless digitisation of the analog signal. Furthermore, a computing unit next to the analog-to-digital converter enables implementation of on-the-fly data processing and control algorithms. This paper presents the detailed concept and the performance of the intelligent Photomultiplier Tube.</p>

<p>2023-07-31, <strong>On the ‘Loose’ Constraint from IceCube Neutrino Non-Detection of GRB 230307A</strong>, Xin-Ying Song et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16547v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.16547v2</a></p>

<p>The recent extremely bright gamma-ray burst (GRB), GRB 230307A from a binary neutron star merger may offer a good probe for the production of GRB-neutrinos. Within the constraint from IceCube neutrino non-detection, the limitations for key physical parameters of this burst are extracted in different scenarios including the fireball, Poynting-flux-dominated (PFD) and hybrid jet. Different from the former nearby `monsters’ and due to its smaller isotropic equivalent radiated energy ($E_{\gamma,\rm iso}\sim4\times10^{52}$ erg), the constraint seems loose if non-thermal neutrinos produced from photomeson interactions are the only consideration. However, a quasi-thermal neutrino emission from hadronuclear processes is constrained in this neutron-rich post-merger environment, and the upper limit of the allowed nucleon loading factor is about a few. Based on this, a discussion is presented on the possible prompt emission mechanism and jet composition for GRB 230307A in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics.</p>

<p>2023-07-31, <strong>R-parity Conserving Minimal SUSY U(1)$_{X}$ Model</strong>, Satsuki Oda et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16480v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.16480v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a minimal gauged U(1)$_X$ extension of the MSSM with R-parity conservation. In this model, U(1)$_X$ is a generalization of the well-known U(1) $B-L$. Apart from the MSSM particle content, the model includes three right-handed neutrino (RHN) chiral superfields, each carrying a unit U(1)$_X$ charge. In the presence of RHNs, the model is free from all gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies. However, there are no U(1)$_X$ Higgs chiral superfields with U(1)$_X$ charge $\pm2$ involved in the model. Two of the RHN superfields are assigned an odd R-parity, while the last one ($\Psi$) has an even parity. The U(1)$_X$ symmetry is radiatively broken by the VEV of the scalar component of $\Psi$. As a consequence of the absence of U(1)$_X$ Higgs fields and the novel R-parity assignment, the three light neutrinos consist of one massless neutrino and two Dirac neutrinos. In the early universe, the right-handed components of the Dirac neutrinos are in thermal equilibrium with the SM particles through the U(1)$_X$ gauge ($Z^\prime$) boson. The extra energy density from the RHNs is constrained to avoid disrupting the success of BBN, leading to a lower bound on the scale of U(1)$_X$ symmetry breaking. In our model, a mixture of the U(1)$_X$ gaugino and the fermionic component of $\Psi$ becomes a new dark matter (DM) candidate if it is the lightest sparticle mass eigenstate. We examine this DM phenomenology and identify a parameter region that reproduces the observed DM relic density. Furthermore, we consider constraints from the search for $Z’$ boson resonance at the LHC. The three constraints obtained from the success of BBN, the observed DM relic density, and the $Z^\prime$ resonance search at the LHC complement each other, narrowing down the allowed parameter region.</p>

<p>2023-07-31, <strong>Predictions of $m_{ee}$ and neutrino mass from a consistent Froggatt-Nielsen model</strong>, Yu-Cheng Qiu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16470v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.16470v1</a></p>

<p>The seesaw mechanism is the most attractive mechanism to explain the small neutrino masses, which predicts the neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) of the nucleus. Thus the discovery of $0\nu\beta\beta$ is extremely important for future particle physics. However, the present data on the neutrino oscillation is not sufficient to predict the value of $m_{ee}$ as well as the neutrino mass $m_\nu^i$. In this short article, by adopting a simple and consistent Froggatt-Nielsen model, which can well explain the observed masses and mixing angles of quark and lepton sectors, we calculate the distribution of $m_{ee}$ and $m_\nu^i$. Interestingly, a relatively large part of the preferred parameter space can be detected in the near future.</p>

<p>2023-07-31, <strong>Prometheus: An Open-Source Neutrino Telescope Simulation</strong>, David Kim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16432v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.16432v1</a></p>

<p>The soon-to-be-realized, global network of neutrino telescopes will allow new opportunities for collaboration between detectors. While each detector is distinct, they share the same underlying physical processes and detection principles. The full simulation chain for these telescopes is typically proprietary which limits the opportunity for joint studies. This means there is no consistent framework for simulating multiple detectors. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prometheus, an open-source simulation tool for neutrino telescopes. Prometheus simulates neutrino injection and final state and photon propagation in both ice and water. It also supports user-supplied injection and detector specifications. In this contribution, we will introduce the software; show its runtime performance; and highlight successes in reproducing simulation results from multiple ice- and water-based observatories.</p>

<p>2023-07-31, <strong>2D Convolutional Neural Network for Event Reconstruction in IceCube DeepCore</strong>, J. H. Peterson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16373v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.16373v1</a></p>

<p>IceCube DeepCore is an extension of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory designed to measure GeV scale atmospheric neutrino interactions for the purpose of neutrino oscillation studies. Distinguishing muon neutrinos from other flavors and reconstructing inelasticity are especially difficult tasks at GeV scale energies in IceCube DeepCore due to sparse instrumentation. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been found to have better success at neutrino event reconstruction than conventional likelihood-based methods. In this contribution, we present a new CNN model that exploits time and depth translational symmetry in IceCube DeepCore data and present the model’s performance, specifically for flavor identification and inelasticity reconstruction.</p>

<p>2023-07-31, <strong>IceCube search for neutrinos from GRB 221009A</strong>, Karlijn Kruiswijk et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16354v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.16354v1</a></p>

<p>GRB 221009A is the brightest Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) ever observed. The observed extremely high flux of high and very-high-energy photons provide a unique opportunity to probe the predicted neutrino counterpart to the electromagnetic emission. We have used a variety of methods to search for neutrinos in coincidence with the GRB over several time windows during the precursor, prompt and afterglow phases of the GRB. MeV scale neutrinos are studied using photo-multiplier rate scalers which are normally used to search for galactic core-collapse supernovae neutrinos. GeV neutrinos are searched starting with DeepCore triggers. These events don’t have directional localization, but instead can indicate an excess in the rate of events. 10 GeV - 1 TeV and &gt;TeV neutrinos are searched using traditional neutrino point source methods which take into account the direction and time of events with DeepCore and the entire IceCube detector respectively. The &gt;TeV results include both a fast-response analysis conducted by IceCube in real-time with time windows of T$_0 - 1$ to T$_0 + 2$ hours and T$_0 \pm 1$ day around the time of GRB 221009A, as well as an offline analysis with 3 new time windows up to a time window of T$_0 - 1$ to T$_0 + 14$ days, the longest time period we consider. The combination of observations by IceCube covers 9 orders of magnitude in neutrino energy, from MeV to PeV, placing upper limits across the range for predicted neutrino emission.</p>

<p>2023-08-01, <strong>Exploring robust correlations between fermionic dark matter model parameters and neutron star properties: A two-fluid perspective</strong>, Prashant Thakur et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00650v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00650v1</a></p>

<p>The current observational properties of neutron stars have not definitively ruled out the possibility of dark matter. In this study, we primarily focus on exploring correlations between the dark matter model parameters and different neutron star properties using a rich set of EOSs. We adopt a two-fluid approach to calculate the properties of neutron stars. For the nuclear matter EOS, we employ several realistic EOS derived from the relativistic mean field model (RMF), each exhibiting varying stiffness and composition. In parallel, we look into the dark matter EOS, considering fermionic matter with repulsive interaction described by a relativistic mean field Lagrangian. A reasonable range of parameters is sampled meticulously. Interestingly, our results reveal a promising correlation between the dark matter model parameters and stellar properties, particularly when we ignore the uncertainties in the nuclear matter EOS. However, when introducing uncertainties in the nuclear sector, the correlation weakens, suggesting that the task of conclusively constraining any particular dark matter model might be challenging using global properties alone, such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Notably, we find that dark-matter admixed stars tend to have higher central baryonic density, potentially allowing for non-nucleonic degrees of freedom or direct Urca processes in stars with lower masses. There is also a tantalizing hint regarding the detection of stars with the same mass but different surface temperatures, which may indicate the presence of dark matter. With our robust and extensive dataset, we delve deeper and demonstrate that even in the presence of dark matter, the semi-universal C-Love relation remains intact.</p>

<p>Galaxy clusters are promising targets for indirect detection of dark matter thanks to the large dark matter content. Using 14 years of Fermi-LAT data from seven nearby galaxy clusters, we obtain constraints on the lifetime of decaying very heavy dark matter particles with masses ranging from $10^3$ GeV to $10^{16}$ GeV. We consider a variety of decaying channels and calculate prompt gamma rays and electrons/positrons from the dark matter. Furthermore, we take into account electromagnetic cascades induced by the primary gamma rays and electrons/positrons, and search for the resulting gamma-ray signals from the directions of the galaxy clusters. We adopt a Navarro-Frenk-White profile of the dark matter halos, and use the profile likelihood method to set lower limits on the dark matter lifetime at a 95% confidence level. Our results are competitive with those obtained through other gamma-ray observations of galaxy clusters and provide complementary constraints to existing indirect searches for decaying very heavy dark matter.</p>

<p>We study an extension of the Standard Model (SM) with two candidates for dark matter (DM) which includes a Dirac fermion and a Vector Dark Matter (VDM) under new $U(1)$ gauge group in the hidden sector. The model is classically scale invariant and the electroweak symmetry breaks because of the loop effects. We investigate the model parameter space allowed by current experimental constraints and phenomenological bounds. It is shown that the model can be satisfied for the large part of parameter space of VDM mass and fermion dark matter mass, i.e., $400&lt; M_V&lt;3000$ GeV and $M_{\psi}&lt;400$ GeV.The electroweak phase transition have been discussed and shown that there is region in the parameter space of the model consistent with DM relic density, direct detection and collider constraints, while at the same time can lead to first order electroweak phase transition. The gravitational waves produced during the phase transition could be probed by future space-based interferometers such as LISA and BBO.</p>

<p>2023-08-01, <strong>Self-consistent dynamical models with a finite extent – III. Truncated power-law spheres</strong>, Maarten Baes et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00366v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00366v1</a></p>

<p>Fully analytical dynamical models usually have an infinite extent, while real star clusters, galaxies, and dark matter haloes have a finite extent. The standard method for generating dynamical models with a finite extent consists of taking a model with an infinite extent and applying a truncation in binding energy. This method, however, cannot be used to generate models with a pre-set analytical mass density profile. We investigate the self-consistency and dynamical properties of a family of power-law spheres with a general tangential Cuddeford (TC) orbital structure. By varying the density power-law slope $\gamma$ and the central anisotropy $\beta_0$, these models cover a wide parameter space in density and anisotropy profiles. We explicitly calculate the phase-space distribution function for various parameter combinations, and interpret our results in terms of the energy distribution of bound orbits. We find that truncated power-law spheres can be supported by a TC orbital structure if and only if $\gamma \geqslant 2\beta_0$, which means that the central density slope-anisotropy inequality is both a sufficient and a necessary condition for this family. We provide closed expressions for structural and dynamical properties such as the radial and tangential velocity dispersion profiles, which can be compared against more complex numerical modelling results. This work significantly adds to the available suite of self-consistent dynamical models with a finite extent and an analytical description.</p>

<p>In this paper, we present several explicit reconstructions for a novel relativistic theory of modified Newtonian dynamics (RMOND) derived from the background of Friedmann-Lema$\hat{\text{\i}}$tre-Robertson-Walker cosmological evolution. It is shown that the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian with a positive cosmological constant is the only Lagrangian capable of accurately replicating the exact expansion history of the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) universe filled solely with dust-like matter and the only way to achieve this expansion history for the RMOND theory is to introduce additional degrees of freedom to the matter sectors. Besides, we find that the $\Lambda$CDM-era also can be replicated without any real matter field within the framework of the RMOND theory and the cosmic evolution exhibited by both the power-law and de-Sitter solutions also can be obtained.</p>

<p>2023-08-01, <strong>A detached double X-ray tail in the merging galaxy cluster Z8338 with a large double tail</strong>, Chong Ge et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00328v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00328v1</a></p>

<p>When subhalos infall into galaxy clusters, their gas content is ram pressure stripped by the intracluster medium (ICM) and may turn into cometary tails. We report the discovery of two spectacular X-ray double tails in a single galaxy cluster, Z8338, revealed by 70 ks Chandra observations. The brighter one, with an X-ray bolometric luminosity of $3.9 \times 10^{42}{\rm\ erg\ s}^{-1}$, is a detached tail stripped from the host halo and extended at least 250 kpc in projection. The head of the detached tail is a cool core with the front tip of the cold front $\sim$ 30 kpc away from the nucleus of its former host galaxy. The cooling time of the detached cool core is $\sim 0.3$ Gyr. For the detached gas, the gravity of the once-associated dark matter halo further enhances the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability. From its survival, we find that a magnetic field of a few $\mu$G is required to suppress the hydrodynamic instability. The X-ray temperature in the tail increases from 0.9 keV at the front tip to 1.6 keV in the wake region, which suggests the turbulent mixing with the hotter ICM. The fainter double X-ray tail, with a total X-ray luminosity of $2.7 \times 10^{42}{\rm\ erg\ s}^{-1}$, appears to stem from the cool core of a subcluster in Z8338, and likely was formed during the ongoing merger. This example suggests that X-ray cool cores can be displaced and eventually destroyed by mergers, while the displaced cool cores can survive for some extended period of time.</p>

<p>The absorption of fermionic dark matter has recently been studied as a signature for the direct detection of dark matter. We construct the first UV completion of the scalar effective operator associated with this signature. We calculate the constraints on the model and demonstrate there is viable parameter space which can be probed by a next-generation experiment such as XLZD. We also consider the cosmological history of our model and show that the correct relic abundance can be obtained via freeze-out in the dark sector. However, within this minimal model, we find that the absorption signal is highly suppressed in the parameter space that yields the correct relic abundance.</p>

<p>We present a novel interpretation of the thermodynamics of perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) black hole based on Misner-Sharp energy, and then investigate its evaporation behavior. We find that the ratio between dark sector initial density and black hole horizon radius significantly influences black hole evaporation behaviors. We demonstrate that the presence of the dark sector can significantly extend the lifetime of a black hole which is similar to the Reissner-Nordstrom case. Our work reformulates the thermodynamics of PFDM black holes and points out the existence of long-lived black holes in the presence of the dark sector.</p>

<p>The scattering of sub-GeV dark matter in direct detection experiments happens at characteristic wavelengths comparable or larger than the interparticle spacing. Collective effects in the target material must therefore be accounted for when calculating the scattering rate. For dark matter-nucleon couplings, this implies matching onto the appropriate phonon effective theory and calculating single and multi-phonon scattering amplitudes. For dark matter-electron couplings, we make use of the energy loss formalism to predict the scattering rate. Combining both techniques allows us to derive a formula for the Migdal effect in crystals, which differs from prior calculations performed in atomic systems.</p>

<p>Cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds (CGWBs) are the conglomeration of unresolved gravitational wave signals from early Universe sources, which make them a promising tool for cosmologists. Because gravitons decouple from the cosmic plasma early on, one can consider interactions between gravitons and any particle species that were present in the very early Universe. Analogous to the cosmic microwave background (CMB), elastic scattering on any cosmological background will induce small distortions in its energy density spectrum. We then quantify the magnitude of these spin-dependent spectral distortions when attributed to the dark matter (DM) in the early Universe. Lastly, we give estimates for potentially measurable distortions on CGWBs due to gravitational scattering by primordial black holes.</p>

<p>2023-07-31, <strong>Painting baryons onto N-body simulations of galaxy clusters with image-to-image deep learning</strong>, Urmila Chadayammuri et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16733v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.16733v2</a></p>

<p>Galaxy cluster mass functions are a function of cosmology, but mass is not a direct observable, and systematic errors abound in all its observable proxies. Mass-free inference can bypass this challenge, but it requires large suites of simulations spanning a range of cosmologies and models for directly observable quantities. In this work, we devise a U-net - an image-to-image machine learning algorithm - to ``paint’’ the IllustrisTNG model of baryons onto dark-matter-only simulations of galaxy clusters. Using 761 galaxy clusters with $M_{200c} \gtrsim 10^{14}M_\odot$ from the TNG-300 simulation at $z&lt;1$, we train the algorithm to read in maps of projected dark matter mass and output maps of projected gas density, temperature, and X-ray flux. The models train in under an hour on two GPUs, and then predict baryonic images for $\sim2700$ dark matter maps drawn from the TNG-300 dark-matter-only (DMO) simulation in under two minutes. Despite being trained on individual images, the model reproduces the true scaling relation and scatter for the $M_{DM}-L_X$, as well as the distribution functions of the cluster X-ray luminosity and gas mass. For just one decade in cluster mass, the model reproduces three orders of magnitude in $L_X$. The model is biased slightly high when using dark matter maps from the DMO simulation, which is known to have ultra-dense clumps that in the FP simulation are smoothed out by baryonic feedback. The model performs well on inputs from TNG-300-2, whose mass resolution is 8 times coarser; further degrading the resolution biases the predicted luminosity function high. We conclude that U-net-based baryon painting is a promising technique to build large simulated cluster catalogs which can be used to improve cluster cosmology by combining existing full-physics and large $N$-body simulations.</p>

<p>Validating the accelerating expansion of the universe is an important issue for understanding the evolution of the universe. By constraining the cosmic acceleration parameter $X_H$, we can discriminate between the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ (cosmological constant plus cold dark matter) model and LTB (the Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi) model. In this paper, we explore the possibility of constraining the cosmic acceleration parameter with the inspiral gravitational waveform of neutron star binaries (NSBs) in the frequency range of 0.1Hz-10Hz, which can be detected by the second-generation space-based gravitational wave detector DECIGO. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM) network combined with a gated recurrent unit (GRU), and Fisher information matrix to derive constraints on the cosmic acceleration parameter $X_H$. Based on the simulated gravitational wave data with a time duration of 1 month, we conclude that CNN can limit the relative error to 14.09%, while LSTM network combined with GRU can limit the relative error to 13.53%. Additionally, using Fisher information matrix for gravitational wave data with a 5-year observation can limit the relative error to 32.94%. Compared with the Fisher information matrix method, deep learning techniques will significantly improve the constraints on the cosmic acceleration parameters at different redshifts. Therefore, DECIGO is expected to provide direct measurements of the acceleration of the universe, by observing the chirp signals of coalescing binary neutron stars.</p>

<p>Spatiotemporal techniques for signal coordination with actively transmitting extraterrestrial civilizations, without the need for prior communication, can constrain technosignature searches to a significantly smaller coordinate space. With the variable star catalog from Gaia Data Release 3, we explore two related signaling strategies: the SETI Ellipsoid, and that proposed by Seto, which are both based on the synchronization of transmissions with a conspicuous astrophysical event. This dataset contains more than 10 million variable star candidates with light curves from the first three years of Gaia’s operational phase, between 2014 and 2017. Using four different historical supernovae as source events, we find that less than 0.01% of stars in the sample have crossing times, the times at which we would expect to receive synchronized signals on Earth, within the date range of available Gaia observations. For these stars, we present a framework for technosignature analysis that searches for modulations in the variability parameters by splitting the stellar light curve at the crossing time.</p>

<p>2023-07-31, <strong>Trading oxygen for iron I: the [O/Fe] – specific star formation rate relation of galaxies</strong>, Martyna Chruślińska et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00023v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.00023v1</a></p>

<p>Our current knowledge of star-forming metallicity relies primarily on gas-phase oxygen abundance measurements. This may not allow one to accurately describe differences in stellar evolution and feedback driven by variations in iron abundance. $\alpha$-elements (such as oxygen) and iron are produced by sources that operate on different timescales and the link between them is not straightforward. We explore the origin of the [O/Fe] - specific SFR (sSFR) relation, linking chemical abundances to galaxy formation timescales. This relation is followed by star-forming galaxies across redshifts according to cosmological simulations and basic theoretical expectations. Its apparent universality makes it suitable for trading the readily available oxygen for iron abundance. The relation is determined by the relative iron production efficiency of core-collapse and type Ia supernovae and the delay time distribution of the latter – uncertain factors that could be constrained empirically with the [O/Fe]-sSFR relation. We compile and homogenise a literature sample of star-forming galaxies with observational iron abundance determinations to place first constraints on the [O/Fe]-sSFR relation over a wide range of sSFR. The relation shows a clear evolution towards lower [O/Fe] with decreasing sSFR and a flattening above log(sSFR/yr)&gt;-9. The result is broadly consistent with expectations, but better constraints are needed to inform the models. We independently derive the relation from old Milky Way stars and find a remarkable agreement between the two, as long as the recombination-line absolute oxygen abundance scale is used in conjunction with stellar metallicity measurements.</p>

<p>2023-07-31, <strong>The evolution of relative frequencies of ONe and CO SNe Ia</strong>, A. I. Bogomazov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16556v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.16556v1</a></p>

<p>In this population synthesis work we study a variety of possible origin channels of supernovae type Ia (SNe Ia) Among them mergers of carbon-oxygen (CO) and oxygen-neon (ONe) white dwarfs (WDs) under the influence of gravitational waves are considered as the primary channel of SNe Ia formation. We estimated frequencies of mergers of WDs with different chemical compositions and distributions of masses of merging WDs. We computed the dependence of the ratio of merger frequencies of ONe and CO WDs as primaries in corresponding binaries on time. The scatter of masses of considered sources (up to the factor $1.5-2$) of SNe Ia is important and should be carefully studied with other sophisticated methods from theoretical point of view. Our ``game of parameters’’ potentially explains the increased dimming of SNe Ia in the redshift range $z\approx 0.5-1$ by the changes in the ratio of ONe and CO WDs, i.e., to describe the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe in terms of the evolution of properties of SNe Ia instead of cosmological explanations. This example shows the extreme importance of theoretical studies of problems concerning SNe Ia, because evolutionary scenario and parameter games in nature potentially lead to confusions in their empirical standardization and, therefore, they can influence on cosmological conclusions.</p>

<p>In this paper, we present a cosmology-independent method to constrain cosmological models from the latest 221 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) sample, including 49 GRBs from Fermi catalog with the Amati relation (the $E_{\rm p}$-${E}_{\rm iso}$ correlation), which calibrated by using a Gaussian process from the Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) sample. With 182 GRBs at $0.8\le z\le8.2$ in the Hubble diagram and the latest observational Hubble data (OHD) by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we obtained $\Omega_{\rm m}$ = $0.348^{+0.048}_{-0.066}$ and $h$ = $0.680^{+0.029}_{-0.029}$ for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ = $0.318^{+0.067}_{-0.059}$, $h$ = $0.704^{+0.055}_{-0.068}$, $w$ = $-1.21^{+0.32}_{-0.67}$ for the flat $w$CDM model. These results are consistent with those in which the coefficients of the Amati relation and the cosmological parameters fitted simultaneously.</p>
