<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Search for heavy neutral leptons in electron-positron and neutral-pion final states with the MicroBooNE detector</strong>, MicroBooNE collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07660v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07660v1</a></p>

<p>We present the first search for heavy neutral leptons (HNL) decaying into $\nu e^+e^-$ or $\nu\pi^0$ final states in a liquid-argon time projection chamber using data collected with the MicroBooNE detector. The data were recorded synchronously with the NuMI neutrino beam from Fermilab’s Main Injector corresponding to a total exposure of $7.01 \times 10^{20}$ protons on target. We set upper limits at the $90\%$ confidence level on the mixing parameter $\lvert U_{\mu 4}\rvert^2$ in the mass ranges $10\le m_{\rm HNL}\le 150$ MeV for the $\nu e^+e^-$ channel and $150\le m_{\rm HNL}\le 245$ MeV for the $\nu\pi^0$ channel, assuming $\lvert U_{e 4}\rvert^2 = \lvert U_{\tau 4}\rvert^2 = 0$. These limits represent the most stringent constraints in the mass range $35&lt;m_{\rm HNL}&lt;175$ MeV and the first constraints from a direct search for $\nu\pi^0$ decays.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Commissioning, Calibration, and Performance of the Cherenkov Telescope on EUSO-SPB2</strong>, Oscar Fernando Romero Matamala et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07561v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07561v1</a></p>

<p>The detection of astrophysical neutrinos by IceCube in the TeV-PeV energy range motivates the development of instruments for observing these particles at higher energies. Moreover, the detection of very-high-energy (VHE) neutrinos could potentially bring constraints on ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) source models. Tau neutrinos skimming the Earth under a shallow angle can be detected through the decay of a tau resulting in an extensive air shower (EAS) in the atmosphere. The EAS can be detected by capturing some of the optical Cherenkov signal originating from the EAS particles. To assess the feasibility of the Earth-skimming technique from high altitudes, we developed a Cherenkov telescope which was deployed on the Extreme Universe Space Observatory Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) from Wanaka, NZ, on May $13^{th}$. It is a precursor for the Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics. The 1m diameter Cherenkov telescope for EUSO-SPB2 had a focal plane comprised of 512 silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) covering a 6.4 x 12.8 square degree field of view coupled to a 100 MS/s readout based on the GET switch capacitor ring sampler. We discuss the calibration and commissioning of the telescope and its in-flight performance.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Slepton searches in the trilinear RPV SUSY scenarios at the HL-LHC and HE-LHC</strong>, Arghya Choudhury et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07532v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07532v1</a></p>

<p>In this work we have studied a multi-lepton final state arising from sneutrino and left-handed slepton production at the high luminosity and high energy LHC in the context of R-parity violating supersymmetry when only the lepton number violating $\lambda_{121}$ and/or $\lambda_{122}$ couplings are non-zero. We have taken into account both pair production and associated production of the three generations of left-handed sleptons and sneutrinos, which are assumed to be mass degenerate. The lightest supersymmetric particle is assumed to be bino and it decays via the R-parity violating couplings into light leptons and neutrinos. Our final state has a large lepton multiplicity, $N_{l}\geq 4~(l=e,~\mu)$. We perform both cut-based and machine learning based analyses for comparison. We present our results in the bino-slepton/sneutrino mass plane in terms of exclusion and discovery reach at the LHC. Following our analysis, the slepton mass can be discovered upto $\sim$ 1.54 TeV and excluded upto $\sim$ 1.87 TeV at the high luminosity LHC while these ranges go upto $\sim$ 2.46 TeV and $\sim$ 3.06 TeV respectively at the high energy LHC.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>The Impact of Southern-Hemisphere Radio Blazar Observations on Neutrino Astronomy</strong>, F. Rösch et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07468v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07468v1</a></p>

<p>The origin of high-energy cosmic neutrinos detected by the IceCube observatory is a hotly debated topic in astroparticle physics. There is growing evidence that some of these neutrinos can be associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN) and especially with blazars. Several recent studies have revealed a statistical correlation between radio-bright AGN samples and IceCube neutrino event catalogs. In addition, a growing number of individual high-energy neutrinos have been found to coincide with individual radio-flaring blazars. These observational results strongly call for high-quality, high angular-resolution radio observations of such neutrino-associated blazars to study their parsec-scale jet structures. TANAMI is the only large and long-term VLBI monitoring program focused on the Southern sky. Within TANAMI, we put an emphasis on Southern IceCube neutrino candidate blazars at 2.3 GHz and 8.4 GHz. Here we present first results of the first high-quality, high angular-resolution VLBI observations of nine Southern-Hemisphere blazars that were associated to IceCube neutrino hotspots in the Southern sky. In the near future, the rapidly growing KM3NeT will complement IceCube by being sensitive to high-energy neutrinos mainly from the Southern Hemisphere. This will increase the importance of Southern-Hemisphere radio monitoring programs of neutrino-associated blazars, like TANAMI.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Constraints on a Generalization of Geometric Quantum Mechanics from Neutrino and $B^0$-$\overline{B^0}$ Oscillations</strong>, Nabin Bhatta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07457v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07457v1</a></p>

<p>Nambu Quantum Mechanics, proposed in Phys. Lett. B536, 305 (2002), is a deformation of canonical Quantum Mechanics in which the manifold over which the “phase” of an energy eigenstate time evolves is modified. This generalization affects oscillation and interference phenomena through the introduction of two deformation parameters that quantify the extent of deviation from canonical Quantum Mechanics. In this paper, we constrain these parameters utilizing atmospheric neutrino oscillation data, and $B^0$-$\overline{B^0}$ oscillation data from Belle. Surprisingly, the bound from atmospheric neutrinos is stronger than the bound from Belle. Various features of Nambu Quantum Mechanics are also discussed.</p>

<p>Magnetism is a rich subject touching all aspects of physics. My goal with this dissertation is to explore spin and magnetic moments in \emph{relativistic} mechanics from both a quantum and classical perspective. We emphasize the special case of gyromagnetic ratio $g!=!2$ and its relationship to the algebraic spin structure of wave equations. In relativistic quantum mechanics, we investigate generalizations of the Dirac equation for arbitrary magnetic moments for fermions. We analyze the homogeneous magnetic field case and the Coulomb problem for hydrogen-like atoms with emphasis on the role of the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM). We explore alternative approaches which combine mass and the magnetic moment. Classically, we propose a relativistic covariant model of the Stern-Gerlach force via the introduction of a magnetic four-potential. This model modifies the covariant torque equations and unites the Amp`erian and Gilbertian models for magnetic moments.   We further study (transition) magnetic dipoles in Majorana neutrinos specifically analyzing the relationship between flavor mixing and electromagnetic (EM) fields. We demonstrate EM flavor mixing explicitly in the 2-flavor model and develop a dynamical mass basis with an EM rotation matrix. EM induced neutrino mass splitting is compared to neutrino mass hierarchy.   An interesting application of these theoretical developments is to study primordial magnetization in the early universe during the hot dense electron-positron plasma epoch. We propose a model of magnetic thermal matter-antimatter plasmas. We analyze the paramagnetic characteristics of electron-positron plasma when exposed to an external primordial field.   Future research outlooks include: Second order equations for anomalous quantum chromodynamic (QCD) moments, neutrino CP violation in strong EM fields, and fifth-dimension spin dynamics in Kaluza-Klein theory.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Simulating MCP secondary electron avalanche process by Geant4</strong>, Huaxing Peng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07153v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07153v1</a></p>

<p>The curved channel Microchannel Plates(MCP) represent a significant advancement in inhibiting ion-feedback, which is the major cause of after-pulse in output signal of MCPs. Many high sensitive experiments, such as neutrino detection, require as low noise as possible. The conventional straight channel MCP is inevitable to introduce the after-pulses, which are the major source of noise. Normally, couple two straight MCPs in cascade and combine the channels into a “V” shape can effectively suppress ion-feedback, known as chevron MCPs. However, due to the limitation manufacture technology, the gap always exist. It will worsen the resolution and peak-to-valley ratio. Different with the joint MCPs that is mentioned above, the curved MCPs exhibit superior characteristics. Based on the Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation framework, we investigate how the geometrical parameter of curved channel MCP influence the gain. Consequently, when the MCP thickness and operating voltage are fixed, an optimum pore radius exists to reach maximum gain. Additionally, The simulation of electron tracks in MCP channels reveals that the average acceleration distance before incident inner wall is approximately 20 $\upmu \mathrm{m}$ for a curved MCP with applied voltage 950 V, length-diameter-ratio 80:1, and pore diameter 20 $\upmu \mathrm{m}$</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Probing self-interacting sterile neutrino dark matter with the diffuse supernova neutrino background</strong>, A. Baha Balantekin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07145v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07145v1</a></p>

<p>The neutrinos in the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) travel over cosmological distances and this provides them with an excellent opportunity to interact with dark relics. We show that a cosmologically-significant relic population of keV-mass sterile neutrinos with strong self-interactions could imprint their presence in the DSNB. The signatures of the self-interactions would be “dips” in the otherwise smooth DSNB spectrum. Upcoming large-scale neutrino detectors, for example Hyper-Kamiokande, have a good chance of detecting the DSNB and these dips. If no dips are detected, this method serves as an independent constraint on the sterile neutrino self-interaction strength and mixing with active neutrinos. We show that relic sterile neutrino parameters that evade X-ray and structure bounds may nevertheless be testable by future detectors like TRISTAN, but may also produce dips in the DSNB which could be detectable. Such a detection would suggest the existence of a cosmologicaly-significant, strongly self-interacting sterile neutrino background, likely embedded in a richer dark sector.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>Analysis of above-the-limb Cosmic Rays for EUSO-SPB2</strong>, Austin Cummings et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07063v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07063v1</a></p>

<p>The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) experiment is a pathfinder mission for future space-based instruments targeting the fluxes of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR), with energies exceeding 1EeV and very high energy diffuse and transient neutrinos, with energies exceeding 1PeV. Using two telescope designs: the Fluorescence Telescope (FT) and the Cherenkov Telescope (CT), EUSO-SPB2 made novel observations of the backgrounds relevant for space-based detection. EUSO-SPB2 will launch from Wanaka, NZ in Spring of 2023, for a long duration (up to 100d) flight at a nominal float altitude of 33km.   In this contribution, we will focus on the CT’s capability to measure cosmic rays from above Earth’s limb via the Cherenkov emission produced by the resultant Extensive Air Showers (EAS). Using the EASCherSim optical Cherenkov generation code, we provide an updated estimate of the event rate of above-the-limb cosmic rays for the CT, taking into account updated values for the trigger efficiency as determined during the field testing of the instrument. We take particular care to consider the longitudinal development of EAS in rarefied atmosphere, accounting for the energy dependent elongation rate. In addition, we consider improvements to the magnetic field modeling present in EASCherSim and illustrate their impact on the observed events and detection thresholds. Finally, we compare these simulations to preliminary flight data from EUSO-SPB2.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>MARES: A macroscopic approach to the radar echo scatter from high-energy particle cascades</strong>, E. Huesca Santiago et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06731v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06731v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we provide a macroscopic model to predict the radar echo signatures found when a radio signal is reflected from a cosmic-ray or neutrino-induced particle cascade propagating in a dense medium like ice. Its macroscopic nature allows for an energy independent runtime, taking less than 10 s for simulating a single scatter event. As a first application, we discuss basic signal properties and simulate the expected signal for the T-576 beam-test experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). We find good signal strength agreement with the only observed radar echo from a high-energy particle cascade to date.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>On the minimal mass of thermal dark matter and the viability of millicharged particles affecting 21cm cosmology</strong>, Xiaoyong Chu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06611v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06611v1</a></p>

<p>Thermal freeze-out offers an attractive explanation of the dark matter density free from fine-tuning of initial conditions. For dark matter with a mass below tens of MeV, photons, electrons, and neutrinos are the only available direct Standard Model annihilation products. Using a full three-sector abundance calculation, we determine the minimal mass of dark matter, allowing for an arbitrary branching into electrons/photons and neutrinos that is compatible with current cosmological observations. The analysis takes into account the heat transfer between the various sectors from annihilation and elastic scattering, representing the first fully self-consistent analysis that tracks the respective sectors’ temperatures. We thereby provide accurate thermal annihilation cross sections, particularly for velocity-dependent cases, and deduce the sensitivity of current and upcoming CMB experiments to MeV thermal dark matter. In the latter context, we also establish the fine-tuned parameter region where a tiny admixture of neutrinos in the final states rules in MeV-scale $p$-wave annihilating DM into electrons. Finally, we show that a sub-% millicharged dark matter with an interaction strength that interferes with 21~cm cosmology is still allowed when freeze-out is supplemented with annihilation into neutrinos. For all cases considered, we provide concrete particle physics models and supplement our findings with a discussion of other relevant experimental results.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>A tolerable candle: the low-$ν$ method with LHC neutrinos</strong>, Callum Wilkinson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06520v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06520v1</a></p>

<p>The Forward Physics Facility (FPF) plans to use neutrinos produced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to make a variety of measurements at previously unexplored TeV energies. Its primary goals include precision measurements of the neutrino cross section and using the measured neutrino flux both to uncover information about far-forward hadron production and to search for various beyond standard model scenarios. However, these goals have the potential to conflict: extracting information about the flux or cross section relies upon an assumption about the other. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that the FPF can use the low-$\nu$ method – a technique for constraining the flux shape by isolating neutrino interactions with low energy transfer to the nucleus – to break this degeneracy. We show that the low-$\nu$ method is effective for extracting the $\nu_{\mu}$ flux shape, in a model-independent way. We discuss its application for extracting the $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ flux shape, but find that this is significantly more model dependent. Finally, we explore the precision to which the $\nu_{\mu}$ flux shape could be constrained at the FPF, for a variety of proposed detector options. We find that the precision would be sufficient to discriminate between various realistic flux models.</p>

<p>We discuss the electron and muon neutrino and antineutrino charged current quasielastic double differential cross sections on carbon by projecting them in the transferred momentum-energy plane. This visually allows to easily understand the surprising dominance of the muon neutrino and antineutrino cross sections over the electron ones in particular kinematical conditions.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>First attempt of directionality reconstruction for atmospheric neutrinos in a large homogeneous liquid scintillator detector</strong>, Zekun Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06281v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06281v1</a></p>

<p>The directionality information of incoming neutrinos is essential to atmospheric neutrino oscillation analysis since it is directly related to the oscillation baseline length. Large homogeneous liquid scintillator detectors, while offering excellent energy resolution, are traditionally very limited in their capabilities of measuring event directionality. In this paper, we present a novel directionality reconstruction method for atmospheric neutrino events in large homogeneous liquid scintillator detectors based on waveform analysis and machine learning techniques. We demonstrate for the first time that such detectors can achieve good direction resolution and potentially play an important role in future atmospheric neutrino oscillation measurements.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Constraining Bianchi-I universe with Pantheon SNIa data</strong>, Anshul Verma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07661v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07661v1</a></p>

<p>We study the Bianchi-I cosmological model motivated by signals of statistical isotropy violation seen in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and others. To that end, we consider various kinds of anisotropic matter that source anisotropy in our model, specifically cosmic strings, magnetic fields, domain walls and Lorentz violation generated magnetic fields. These anisotropic matter sources, taking one at a time, are studied for their co-evolution with standard model (isotropic) sources viz., dust-like (dark/normal) matter and dark energy modelled as cosmological constant. We constrain the Hubble parameter, density fractions of anisotropic matter, isotropic cold dark matter (CDM) and dark energy ($\Lambda$) in a Bianchi-I universe with planar symmetry i.e., with a global ellipsoidal geometry, and try to find signatures of a cosmic preferred axis if any. Pantheon Type Ia Supernova (SNIa) data is used in our study to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters of this model. In our analysis, we found a cosmic axis of anisotropy using SN1e data. Interestingly this preferred axis lies in the same direction, broadly, as some other cosmic anisotropy axes reported in the literature such as the CMB hemispherical power asymmetry, etc., with some of anisotropic sources considered.

<p>Gravitational particle production of spectator fields due to the expansion universe during the inflationary and reheating phases of the early universe is of particular interest in the context of dark matter, since it allows to constrain the properties of the dark candidate by comparing the density of particles produced with the observed dark matter abundance. In such processes, tachyonic instabilities arise as a consequence of the coupling to the curvature, greatly enhancing mode production. In this work, we consider a massive vector field that is coupled to the curvature scalar and the Ricci tensor only, and study its gravitational production through inflation and reheating. We show how the mechanism is more efficient than in the case of a non-minimally coupled scalar field, giving rise to larger abundances. Moreover, we analyze the importance of the coupling to the Ricci tensor, which increases tachyonic instabilities in the system, and constrain the mass of the dark particle and the values of the coupling constants by comparing the corresponding abundance with observations</p>

<p>In this work, we assume the FRLW Universe which is filled with dark matter along with dark energy in the framework of Horava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity. The dark energy is considered as the Linear (Model I) and CPL (Model II) parametrizations of the equation of state parameter. For both models, we express the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ in terms of the model parameters and redshift $z$. To rigorously constrain the model, we have employed a comprehensive set of recent observational datasets including cosmic chronometers (CC), Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Gamma-ray Burst (GRB), Quasar (Q) and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB). Through the joint analysis of this diverse collection of datasets, we have achieved tighter constraints on the model’s parameters. This, in turn, allows us to delve into both the physical and geometrical aspects of the model with greater precision. Furthermore, our analysis has enabled us to determine the present values of crucial cosmological parameters, including $H_{0}$, $\Omega_{m0}$, $\Omega_{k0}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda0}$. It’s noteworthy that our results are consistent with recent findings from Planck 2018, underscoring the reliability and relevance of our models in the current cosmological context. We also conduct analysis of cosmographic parameters and apply statefinder and diagnostic tests to explore the evolution of the Universe. In addition, the AIC and BIC suggest that the $\Lambda$CDM model is the preferred model among all our considered models. Our investigation into the models has unveiled intriguing features of the late universe</p>

<p>The Hubble constant $H_0$ is one of the important cosmological parameters measuring the expansion rate of our universe at present moment. Over the last couple of years, $H_0$ has created an enormous amount of debates interests in the astrophysical and cosmological communities for its different estimations at many standard deviations by different observational surveys. The recent estimation of $H_0$ from the cosmic microwave background observations by Planck within the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm is in tension with $\gtrsim 5 \sigma$ confidence with SH0ES (Supernovae and $H_0$ for the Equation of State of dark energy) collaboration. As a result, revision of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model has been suggested in various ways in order to examine whether such scenarios can solve this $H_0$ tension. Among the list of the proposed cosmological scenarios, in this chapter we focus on a generalized cosmological theory in which the dark components of the universe, namely, Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) are allowed to interact with each other in a non-gravitational way, widely known as the Interacting DE or Coupled DE scenarios. These interacting scenarios have received magnificent attention in the scientific community for their appealing consequences. Specifically, in the context of $H_0$ tension, it has been observed that the interacting DE scenarios can lead to higher values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) value, and consequently, the tension on $H_0$ can be either alleviated or solved. In this chapter we review various interacting DE scenarios and their roles in alleviating the $H_0$ tension.</p>

<p>This study presents a general outline of the Qitai radio telescope (QTT) project. Qitai, the site of the telescope, is a county of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China, located in the east Tianshan Mountains at an elevation of about 1800 m. The QTT is a fully steerable, Gregorian type telescope with a standard parabolic main reflector of 110 m diameter. The QTT has adopted an um-brella support, homology-symmetric lightweight design. The main reflector is active so that the deformation caused by gravity can be corrected. The structural design aims to ultimately allow high-sensitivity observations from 150 MHz up to 115 GHz. To satisfy the requirements for early scientific goals, the QTT will be equipped with ultra-wideband receivers and large field-of-view mul-ti-beam receivers. A multi-function signal-processing system based on RFSoC and GPU processor chips will be developed. These will enable the QTT to operate in pulsar, spectral line, continuum and Very Long Baseline Interferometer (VLBI) observing modes. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and radio frequency interference (RFI) control techniques are adopted throughout the system design. The QTT will form a world-class observational platform for the detection of low-frequency (nanoHertz) gravitational waves through pulsar timing array (PTA) techniques, pulsar surveys, the discovery of binary black-hole systems, and exploring dark matter and the origin of life in the universe.</p>

<p>Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with electroweak charges, such as the wino and the Higgsino, stand out as natural candidates for dark matter in the universe. In this paper, we study the search for WIMPs at future multi-TeV $\mu^+\mu^+$ colliders. We investigate both the direct production search of WIMPs through the mono-muon channel and the indirect search through quantum corrections in elastic $\mu^+\mu^+$ Moller scattering. We find that the indirect search has an advantage over the direct search with sufficient luminosities, $\mathcal{O}(\text{ab}^{-1})$, and low systematic uncertainties, $\lesssim 0.3\,\%$. This advantage arises due to the weaker mass dependence observed in the indirect search in comparison to direct production methods. The advantage is further enhanced if the initial muon beams are polarized. Specifically, we demonstrate that the indirect search method can detect the thermal mass target for the wino and the Higgsino for $\sqrt{s} = 6\,\text{TeV}$ and $2\,\text{TeV}$ (with $\sqrt{s}$ being the center of mass energy), respectively, with $10\,\text{ab}^{-1}$, an $80\,\%$ polarized beam and an accuracy of $0.1\,\%$. Our findings illuminate the potential of future high-energy $\mu^+\mu^+$ colliders in advancing our understanding of dark matter.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>The classical field approximation of ultra light dark matter: quantum breaktimes, corrections, and decoherence</strong>, Andrew Eberhardt et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07119v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07119v1</a></p>

<p>The classical field approximation is widely used to better understand the predictions of ultra-light dark matter. Here, we use the truncated Wigner approximation method to test the classical field approximation of ultra-light dark matter. This method approximates a quantum state as an ensemble of independently evolving realizations drawn from its Wigner function. The method is highly parallelizable and allows the direct simulation of quantum corrections and decoherence times in systems many times larger than have been previously studied in reference to ultra-light dark matter. Our study involves simulation of systems in 1, 2, and 3 spatial dimensions. We simulate three systems, the condensation of a Gaussian random field in three spatial dimensions, a stable collapsed object in three spatial dimensions, and the merging of two stable objects in two spatial dimensions. We study the quantum corrections to the classical field theory in each case. We find that quantum corrections grow exponentially during nonlinear growth with the timescale being approximately equal to the system dynamical time. In stable systems the corrections grow quadratically. We also find that the primary effect of quantum corrections is to reduce the amplitude of fluctuations on the deBroglie scale in the spatial density. Finally, we find that the timescale associated with decoherence due to gravitational coupling to Baryonic matter is at least as fast as the quantum corrections due to gravitational interactions. These results strongly imply that quantum corrections do not impact the predictions of the classical field theory.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>Super-slow phase transition catalyzed by BHs and the birth of baby BHs</strong>, Ryusuke Jinno et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06901v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06901v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the unique phenomenology of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) catalyzed by primordial black holes (BHs). Because of the enhancement of the vacuum nucleation rate around a BH, vacuum nucleation can be triggered only around BHs. If the average number of BHs within one Hubble volume is smaller than unity at the time of bubble nucleation, each bubble catalyzed around them expands to the Hubble size, and the Hubble patches containing BHs transition to the true vacuum, whereas the rest of the universe remains in the false vacuum. Assuming that the vacuum energy difference is negligible in relation to the total energy until a time close to the bubble collision, most false-vacuum patches do not undergo inflation, and the entire universe is eventually filled with true-vacuum bubbles much after BH formation and bubble nucleation. This “super-slow phase transition” scenario predicts enhanced gravitational wave signals from bubble collisions and can be tested in future observations. Moreover, a small fraction of the universe remains in the false vacuum and inflates by chance, and the corresponding region can be seen as a BH from an outside observer. This scenario of “birth of baby BHs from parent BHs” via the catalyzed phase transition can account for the entire dark matter in our universe.</p>

<p>We investigate the steady spherically symmetric accretion in the combined potential of a central black hole and a dark matter halo. For the halo, we consider a Hernquist and an NFW potential and calculate the critical points of the flow. We find that the trans-sonic solution to the centre is not possible without a black hole, whereas two types of trans-sonic solutions are possible in its presence. We also derive the mass accretion rate for a black hole at the centre of a dark matter halo. Our results indicate two phases of accretion. The first is an initial phase with a low accretion rate that depends on the black hole mass, followed by a second phase with a high accretion rate that depends on the halo mass. In the second phase, the black hole mass increases rapidly to supermassive scales, which explains the existence of quasars at redshift $z\ge 6$ and also the recently detected supermassive black hole (SMBH) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Further, we calculate the evolution of the Eddington ratio for growing black holes. The accretion is mostly sub-Eddington except for a short super-Eddington episode when the mass accretion rate transitions from low to high. However, during that episode, the black hole mass is likely inadequate to hinder accretion through radiative feedback.</p>

<p>Dark matter and cosmic inflation represent two of the major puzzles in cosmology. They are typically addressed by introducing separate fields with independent dynamics. On the other hand, extra dimensions might play an important role for observable physics. We introduce a five-dimensional model called dark inflaxion that includes an axion-like particle, whose Kaluza-Klein modes can describe inflation and dark matter. We show that a simple yet natural choice of the mass scale of the effective four-dimensional fields of our model can accommodate simultaneously the observable values of inflationary parameters and dark-matter abundance. It will be interesting to explore the consequences and predictions of more generic scenarios within the scope of our model, which include the possibility of multifield inflation and dark matter.</p>

<p>The formation of galaxies with warm dark matter is approximately adiabatic. The cold dark matter limit is singular and requires relaxation.

<p>The axion is well motivated in physics. It solves the strong charge conjugation-parity reversal problem CP in fundamental physics and the dark matter problem in astronomy. Its interaction with the electromagnetic field has been expected but never detected experimentally. Such particles may convert to radio waves in the environment with a strong magnetic field. Inspired by the idea, various research groups have been working on theoretical modeling and radio data analysis to search for the signature of radio signals generated by the axion conversion in the magnetosphere of compact stars, where the surface magnetic field as strong as $10^{13}$-$10^{14}$ G is expected. In this work, we calculate the observational properties of the axion-induced radio signals (AIRSs) in the neutron star magnetosphere, where both the total intensity and polarization properties of radio emission are derived. Based on the ray tracing method, assuming 100% linear polarization of radio waves generated in each conversion, we compute the polarization emission profile concerning different viewing angles. We note that plasma and general relativistic effects are important for the polarization properties of AIRSs. Our work suggests that AIRSs can be identified by the narrow bandwidth and distinct polarization features.</p>

<p>We propose a set of precision muon-related observables that serve as a tool to constrain new physics models. Using LEP’s precision measurements on the $Z$-boson pole, we derive bounds on the new physics quantum contributions to the decay $Z \to \mu^+ \mu^-$. We show that the new precision observables have a real impact on two specific models that solve the $g-2$ anomaly and provide a sound dark matter candidate.</p>

<p>We analyse new signals of a 3-Higgs Doublet Model (3HDM) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) where only one doublet acquires a Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV), preserving a $Z_2$ parity. The other two doublets are \textit{inert} and do not develop a VEV, leading to a \textit{dark scalar sector} controlled by $Z_2$, with the lightest CP-even dark scalar $H_1$ being the Dark Matter (DM) candidate. This leads to the loop induced decay of the next-to-lightest scalar, $H_2 \to H_1 \ell \bar \ell $ ($\ell =e,\mu$), mediated by both dark CP-odd neutral and charged scalars. This is a smoking-gun signal of the 3HDM since it is not allowed in the 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) with one inert doublet and is expected to be important when $H_2$ and $H_1$ are close in mass. In practice, this signature can be observed in the cascade decay of the SM-like Higgs boson, $h\to H_1 H_2\to H_1 H_1 \ell \bar \ell$ into two DM particles and di-leptons or $h\to H_2 H_2\to H_1 H_1 \ell \bar \ell \ell \bar \ell$ into two DM particles and four-leptons, where $h$ is produced from gluon-gluon Fusion. In order to test the feasibility of these channels at the LHC, we devise some benchmarks, compliant with collider, DM and cosmological data, for which the interplay between these production and decay modes is discussed. In particular, we show that the resulting detector signatures, $\Et \ell \bar \ell$ or $\Et \ell \bar \ell \ell \bar \ell$, with the invariant mass of $ \ell \bar \ell$ pairs much smaller than $m_Z$, can potentially be extracted already from Run 3 data and at the High-Luminosity phase of the LHC.</p>

<p>Previous work has shown that optomechanical force sensing can be used for efficient detection of ultralight (sub-eV) dark matter candidates. We propose to extend the reach of this method to the search for ultralight dark matter in gravitationally-bound configurations in the Milky Way. We consider three scenarios, each strongly-motivated by previous studies: boson stars traveling in the galaxy with virial velocity; a bosonic halo centered around the Sun (a `solar halo’); and a bosonic halo centered around the Earth. For each case, we consider bound states composed of either scalar particles with a Yukawa coupling, or vector particles coupled to baryon minus lepton number charge. Accounting for all experimental constraints on coupling strength, we estimate the sensitivity reach of an optomechanical sensor search. We conclude that, although boson star encounters with Earth would be too infrequent to be detected in the relevant parameter space, current optomechanical force sensing technologies provide promising search capabilities for solar or Earth-bound halos.</p>

<p>Fine-grained nuclear emulsion films have been developed as a tracking detector with nanometric spatial resolution to be used in direction-sensitive dark matter searches, thanks to novel readout technologies capable of exploiting this unprecedented resolution. Emulsion detectors are time insensitive. Therefore, a directional dark matter search with such detector requires the use of an equatorial telescope to absorb the Earth rotation effect. We have conducted for the first time a directional dark matter search in an unshielded location, at the sea level, by keeping an emulsion detector exposed for 39 days on an equatorial telescope. The observed angular distribution of the data collected during an exposure equivalent to 0.59 g days agrees with the background model and an exclusion plot was then derived in the dark matter mass and cross-section plane: cross-sections higher than 1.1 $\times$10$^{-28}$ cm$^{2}$ and $1.1 \times 10^{-31}$ cm$^2$ were excluded for a dark matter mass of $10$ GeV$/c^2$ and $100$ GeV$/c^2$, respectively. This is the first direction sensitive search for dark matter with a solid-state, particle tracking detector.</p>

<p>We study the Bianchi-I cosmological model motivated by signals of statistical isotropy violation seen in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and others. To that end, we consider various kinds of anisotropic matter that source anisotropy in our model, specifically cosmic strings, magnetic fields, domain walls and Lorentz violation generated magnetic fields. These anisotropic matter sources, taking one at a time, are studied for their co-evolution with standard model (isotropic) sources viz., dust-like (dark/normal) matter and dark energy modelled as cosmological constant. We constrain the Hubble parameter, density fractions of anisotropic matter, isotropic cold dark matter (CDM) and dark energy ($\Lambda$) in a Bianchi-I universe with planar symmetry i.e., with a global ellipsoidal geometry, and try to find signatures of a cosmic preferred axis if any. Pantheon Type Ia Supernova (SNIa) data is used in our study to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters of this model. In our analysis, we found a cosmic axis of anisotropy using SN1e data. Interestingly this preferred axis lies in the same direction, broadly, as some other cosmic anisotropy axes reported in the literature such as the CMB hemispherical power asymmetry, etc., with some of anisotropic sources considered. We also found a non-zero evidence for cosmic shear and eccentricity for our universe with those sources. To be more conclusive, we require more SNIa host galaxy data for tighter constraints on distance and absolute magnitude calibration which we hope will be available from the future JWST observations and other surveys.</p>

<p>Recent results from LHAASO and Tibet AS$\gamma$ suggest that the Crab Nebula’s gamma-ray spectrum extends to the PeV energy range, however the production mechanisms of this highest energy emission remain unclear. It has been postulated that a secondary component of hadronic emission could explain the highest energy gamma-ray flux points, however the origin and acceleration mechanism for this hadronic population has yet to be explained. We postulate one scenario in which hadrons diffuse over time into the Crab pulsar wind nebula from the surrounding supernova ejecta, and are subsequently re-accelerated by the pulsar wind termination shock. We present results of direct particle transport simulations (including radial evolution) to determine if this scenario is viable over the lifetime of the Crab system.</p>

<p>The application of silicon monoxide (SiO) as a shock tracer arises from its propensity to occur in the gas phase as a result of shock-induced phenomena, including outflow activity and interactions between molecular clouds and expanding HII regions or supernova remnants. We searched for indications of shocks toward 366 massive star-forming regions by observing the ground rotational transition of SiO ($v=0$, $J=1-0$) at 43 GHz with the Korean VLBI Network (KVN) 21 m telescopes to extend our understanding on the origins of SiO in star-forming regions. We detected SiO emission toward 104 regions that consist of 57 IRDCs, 21 HMPOs, and 26 UCHIIs. The determined median SiO column density, $N$(SiO), and abundance, $X$(SiO), relative to $N$(H$_2$) are $8.12\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $1.28\times10^{-10}$, respectively. These values are similar to those obtained toward other star-forming regions and also consistent with predicted values from shock models with low-velocity shocks ($\lesssim$10 - 15 km s$^{-1}$). While the $X$(SiO) does not exhibit any strong correlation with the evolutionary stages of their host clumps, $L_{\rm SiO}$ is highly correlated with dust clump mass, and $L_{\rm SiO}/L_{\rm bol}$ also has a strong negative correlation with $T_{\rm dust}$. This shows that colder and younger clumps have high $L_{\rm SiO}/L_{\rm bol}$ suggestive of an evolutionary trend. This trend is not due to excess emission at higher velocities, such as SiO wing features, as the colder sources with high $L_{\rm SiO}/L_{\rm bol}$ ratios lack wing features. Comparing SiO emission with H$_2$O and Class I CH$_3$OH masers, we find a significant correlation between $L_{\rm SiO}$/$L_{\rm bol}$ and $L_{\rm CH_3OH}/L_{\rm bol}$ ratios, whereas no similar correlation is seen for the H$_2$O maser emission. This suggests a similar origin for the SiO and Class I CH$_3$OH emission in these sources.</p>

Spectra taken from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared wavelengths are used for the identification of spectral features. We pay particular attention to the C II lines as they present distinctive characteristics when compared to other events. We also analyze UV and optical photometric data, and model the light curves considering three different powering mechanisms: radioactive decay of Ni, magnetar spin-down and circumstellar material interaction (CSM). The spectra of SN 2020zbf match well with the model spectra of a C-rich low-mass magnetar model. This is consistent with our light curve modelling which supports a magnetar-powered explosion with a $M_{\rm ej}$ = 1.5 $M_\odot$. However, we cannot discard the CSM-interaction model as it also may reproduce the observed features. The interaction with H-poor, carbon-oxygen CSM near peak could explain the presence of C II emission lines. A short plateau in the light curve, around 30 - 40 days after peak, in combination with the presence of an emission line at 6580 \r{A} can also be interpreted as late interaction with an extended H-rich CSM. Both the magnetar and CSM interaction models of SN 2020zbf indicate that the progenitor mass at the time of explosion is between 2 - 5 $M_\odot$. Modelling the spectral energy distribution of the host reveals a host mass of 10$^{8.7}$ $M_\odot$, a star-formation rate of 0.24$^{+0.41}_{-0.12}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and a metallicity of $\sim$ 0.4 $Z_\odot$.</p>

<p>Despite increasingly precise observations and sophisticated theoretical models, the discrepancy between measurements of H0 from the cosmic microwave background or from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations combined with Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis versus those from local distance ladder probes – commonly known as the $H_0$ tension – continues to perplex the scientific community. To address this tension, Early Dark Energy (EDE) models have been proposed as alternatives to $\Lambda$CDM, as they can change the observed sound horizon and the inferred Hubble constant from measurements based on this. In this paper, we investigate the use of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to evaluate EDE as a solution to the H0 tension. BMA consists of assigning a prior to the model and deriving a posterior as for any other unknown parameter in a Bayesian analysis. BMA can be computationally challenging in that one must approximate the joint posterior of both model and parameters. Here we present a computational strategy for BMA that exploits existing MCMC software and combines model-specific posteriors post-hoc. In application to a comprehensive analysis of cosmological datasets, we quantify the impact of EDE on the H0 discrepancy. We find an EDE model probability of $\sim$90% whenever we include the H0 measurement from Type Ia Supernovae in the analysis, whereas the other data show a strong preference for the standard cosmological model. We finally present constraints on common parameters marginalized over both cosmological models. For reasonable priors on models with and without EDE, the H0 tension is reduced by at least 20%.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>On the optical transients from double white-dwarf mergers</strong>, M. F. Sousa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06655v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06655v1</a></p>

<p>Double white-dwarf (DWD) mergers are relevant astrophysical sources expected to produce massive, highly-magnetized WDs, supernovae (SNe) Ia, and neutron stars (NSs). Although they are expected to be numerous sources in the sky, their detection has evaded the most advanced transient surveys. This article characterizes the optical transient expected from DWD mergers in which the central remnant is a stable (sub-Chandrasekhar) WD. We show that the expansion and cooling of the merger’s dynamical ejecta lead to an optical emission peaking at $1$-$10$ d post-merger, with luminosities of $10^{40}$-$10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We present simulations of the light-curves, spectra, and the color evolution of the transient. We show that these properties, together with the estimated rate of mergers, are consistent with the absence of detection, e.g., by The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). More importantly, we show that the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will likely detect a few/several hundred per year, opening a new window to the physics of WDs, NSs, and SN Ia.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>Multi-wavelength observations of multiple eruptions of the recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a</strong>, Judhajeet Basu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06586v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06586v1</a></p>

<p>We report the optical, UV, and soft X-ray observations of the $2017-2022$ eruptions of the recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a. We infer a steady decrease in the accretion rate over the years based on the inter-eruption recurrence period. We find a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cusp'' feature in the $r'$ and $i'$ band light curves close to the peak, which could be associated to jets. Spectral modelling indicates a mass ejection of 10$^{-7}$ to 10$^{-8}$ M$\_{\odot}$ during each eruption, and an enhanced Helium abundance of He/He$\_{\odot}$ $\approx$ 3. The super-soft source (SSS) phase shows significant variability, which is anti-correlated to the UV emission, indicating a common origin. The variability could be due to the reformation of the accretion disk. A comparison of the accretion rate with different models on the $\rm M\_{WD}$$-\dot{M}$ plane yields the mass of a CO WD, powering the</code>H-shell flashes’’ every $\sim$ 1 year to be $&gt;1.36$ M$_{\odot}$ and growing with time, making M31N 2008-12a a strong candidate for the single degenerate scenario of Type Ia supernovae progenitor.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>Discovering neutron stars with LISA via measurements of orbital eccentricity in Galactic binaries</strong>, Christopher J. Moore et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06568v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06568v1</a></p>

<p>LISA will detect $\sim ! 10^4$ Galactic binaries, the majority being double white dwarfs. However, approximately $\sim ! 1 \textrm{–} 5 \%$ of these systems will contain neutron stars which, if they can be correctly identified, will provide new opportunities for studying binary evolution pathways involving mass reversal and supernovae as well as being promising targets for multi-messenger observations. Eccentricity, expected from neutron star natal kicks, will be a key identifying signature for binaries containing a neutron star. Eccentric binaries radiate at widely-spaced frequency harmonics that must first be identified as originating from a single source and then analysed coherently. A multi-harmonic heterodyning approach for this type of data analysis is used to perform Bayesian parameter estimation on a range of simulated eccentric LISA signals. This is used to: (i) investigate LISA’s ability to measure orbital eccentricity and to quantify the minimum detectable eccentricity; (ii) demonstrate how eccentricity and periastron precession help to break the mass degeneracy allowing the individual component masses to be inferred, potentially confirming the presence of a neutron star; (iii) investigate the possibility of source misidentification when the individual harmonics of an eccentric binary masquerade as separate circular binaries; and (iv) investigate the possibility of source reclassification, where parameter estimation results of multiple circular analyses are combined in postprocessing to quickly infer the parameters of an eccentric source. The broader implications of this for the ongoing design of the LISA global fit are also discussed.</p>
