<p>2023-05-30, <strong>Interpreting dark matter solution for $B-L$ gauge symmetry</strong>, Phung Van Dong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19197v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19197v1</a></p>

<p>It is shown that the solution for $B-L$ gauge symmetry with $B-L=-4,-4,+5$ assigned for three right-handed neutrinos respectively, reveals a novel scotogenic mechanism with implied matter parity for neutrino mass generation and dark matter stability. Additionally, the world with two-component dark matter is hinted.</p>

<p>2023-05-30, <strong>A neural network emulator for the Lyman-$α$ 1D flux power spectrum</strong>, Laura Cabayol-Garcia et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19064v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19064v1</a></p>

<p>The Lyman-$\alpha$ offers a unique avenue for studying the distribution of matter in the high redshift universe and extracting precise constraints on the nature of dark matter, neutrino masses, and other $\Lambda$CDM extensions. However, interpreting this observable requires accurate modelling of the thermal and ionisation state of the intergalactic medium, and therefore resorting to computationally expensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this work, we build a neural network that serves as a surrogate model for rapid predictions of the one-dimensional \lya flux power spectrum ($P_{\rm 1D}$), thereby making Bayesian inference feasible for this observable. Our emulation technique is based on modelling $P_{\rm 1D}$ as a function of the slope and amplitude of the linear matter power spectrum rather than as a function of cosmological parameters. We show that our emulator achieves sub-percent precision across the full range of scales ($k_{\parallel }=0.1$ to 4Mpc$^{-1}$) and redshifts ($z=2$ to 4.5) considered, and also for three $\Lambda$CDM extensions not included in the training set: massive neutrinos, running of the spectral index, and curvature. Furthermore, we show that it performs at the 1% level for ionisation and thermal histories not present in the training set and performs at the percent level when emulating down to $k_{\parallel}$=8Mpc$^{-1}$. These results affirm the efficacy of our emulation strategy in providing accurate predictions even for cosmologies and reionisation histories that were not explicitly incorporated during the training phase, and we expect it to play a critical role in the cosmological analysis of the DESI survey.</p>

<p>2023-05-29, <strong>Thermal Leptogenesis in the Minimal Gauged $U(1)_{L_μ-L_τ}$ Model</strong>, Alessandro Granelli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18100v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.18100v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the thermal leptogenesis mechanism within the minimal gauged U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU). In such framework, the phases of the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata neutrino mixing matrix and the sum of the Standard Model neutrino masses are predictable because of a restricted neutrino mass matrix structure. Additionally, in the context of thermal leptogenesis, the BAU can be computed in terms of the three remaining free variables that parameterise the right-handed neutrino masses and their Yukawa couplings to the Higgs and lepton doublets. We identify the ranges of such parameters for which the correct BAU can be reproduced. We adopt the formalism of the density matrix equations to fully account for flavour effects and consider the decays of all the three right-handed neutrinos. Our analysis reveals that thermal leptogenesis is feasible within a wide parameter space, specifically for Yukawa couplings ranging from approximate unity to $\mathcal{O}(0.03-0.05)$ and mass of the lightest right-handed neutrino $M_1\gtrsim 10^{11-12}\,\text{GeV}$, setting a leptogenesis scale in the considered model which is higher than that of the non-thermal scenario.</p>

<p>2023-05-30, <strong>Unitarity, real-intermediate states, and fixed-order approach to resonant dark matter annihilation</strong>, Peter Maták et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19238v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19238v1</a></p>

<p>We study the role of perturbative unitarity in the resonant annihilation of two dark matter particles into the standard model bath. Systematically including all kinematically allowed holomorphic cuts of the corresponding forward-scattering diagram, cancellation of the singularities occurs, resulting in a fixed-order correction to the narrow-width approximation for the annihilation cross section. Unlike the standard approach based on including the finite width of the mediator, no double-counting of intermediate states occurs.</p>

<p>2023-05-30, <strong>Dynamical stability in models where dark matter and dark energy are non-minimally coupled to curvature</strong>, Saddam Hussain et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19062v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19062v1</a></p>

<p>This work explores the dynamical stability of cosmological models where dark matter and dark energy can non-minimally couple to spacetime (scalar) curvature. Two different scenarios are presented here. In the initial case, only dark matter sector is coupled to curvature in the presence of a quintessence scalar field. In the second case both dark matter and the quintessence field are coupled to curvature. It is shown that one can get an accelerating expansion phase of the universe in both the cases. The nature of the fixed points show that there can be stable or unstable phases where the curvature coupling vanishes and dark energy and dark matter evolve independently. On the other hand there can be stable accelerating expansion phases where both the components are coupled to curvature.</p>

<p>2023-05-30, <strong>Modeling and testing screening mechanisms in the laboratory and in space</strong>, Valeri Vardanyan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18899v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.18899v1</a></p>

<p>The non-linear dynamics of scalar fields coupled to matter and gravity can lead to remarkable density-dependent screening effects. In this short review we present the main classes of screening mechanisms, and discuss their tests in laboratory and astrophysical systems. We particularly focus on reviewing numerical and technical aspects involved in modeling the non-linear dynamics of screening. In this review, we focus on tests using laboratory experiments and astrophysical systems, such as stars, galaxies and dark matter halos.</p>

<p>2023-05-30, <strong>Constraints on the dark Z model from the Higgs boson phenomenology</strong>, Dong-Won Jung et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18740v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.18740v1</a></p>

<p>We study constraints on the hidden sector model mediated by an additional SU(2) Higgs doublet from the phenomenology of Higgs bosons. The hidden sector is assumed to contain a hidden U(1) gauge symmetry and the hidden U(1) gauge boson gets the mass by the electroweak symmetry breaking to be a dark Z boson. The Higgs sector of the model is similar to that of the two Higgs doublet model of type I except for the absence of the CP-odd scalar boson. Using the programs of HiggsBounds and HiggsSignals, we incorporate current experimental limits from LEP, Tevatron and LHC to examine the Higgs sector in our model and derive constraints on model parameters. We also discuss the implications of the model on the dark matter phenomenology.</p>

<p>2023-05-30, <strong>The QCD Axion: A Unique Player in the Axiverse with Mixings</strong>, Kai Murai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18677v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.18677v1</a></p>

<p>In an axiverse with numerous axions, the cosmological moduli problem poses a significant challenge because the abundance of axions can easily exceed that of dark matter. The well-established stochastic axion scenario offers a simple solution, relying on relatively low-scale inflation. However, axions are typically subject to mixing due to mass and kinetic terms, which can influence the solution using stochastic dynamics. Focusing on the fact that the QCD axion has a temperature-dependent mass, unlike other axions, we investigate the dynamics of the QCD axion and another axion with mixing. We find that the QCD axion abundance is significantly enhanced and becomes larger than that of the other axion for a certain range of parameters. This enhancement widens the parameter regions accounting for dark matter. In addition, we also find a parameter region in which both axions have enhanced abundances of the same order, which result in multi-component dark matter.</p>

<p>2023-05-29, <strong>Domain Walls of Low Tension in Cosmology</strong>, Holger Bech Nielsen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18645v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.18645v1</a></p>

<p>In the present article we put up for discussion the idea of there existing several versions, phases, of the vacuum, in the spirit in which we have long worked on this idea, namely the Multiple Point Criticality Principle, which also says that these different vacuum phases have the same energy density. We mention that we indeed predicted the Higgs mass to be 135 plus minus 10 GeV, which when measured turned out to be 125 GeV, using the assumption of this Multiple Point Criticality Principle. We consider the possibility that there is one type of vacuum in the galaxy clusters (the usual vacuum) and another type of vacuum in the voids. The hope that there could indeed be such a low tension S of the domain wall between these two phases, that it would not totally upset cosmology is based on our dark matter model. In this model dark matter consists of pearls or bubbles of a new vacuum phase, with ordinary matter inside it under very high pressure. The order of magnitude of cubic root S of order MeV or 100 MeV could make such domain walls astronomically viable. We successfully estimate the order of magnitude of the variations in the fine structure constant in different places astronomically, but the similar variations in proton mass over electron mass should have been much bigger than seen experimentally in our model. The Universe s surprisingly early galaxies seen by JWST, James Webb telescope, may agree well with our model. Replacing the usual cosmological constant by domain walls in the standard cosmological model would lead to a cubic root of the tension being cubic root of S of order 30 MeV.</p>

<p>2023-05-29, <strong>Evidence of dynamical dark energy in a non-flat universe: current and future observations</strong>, Mehdi Rezaei et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18544v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.18544v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the dark energy phenomenology in an extended parameter space where we allow the curvature density of our universe as a free-to-vary parameter. The inclusion of the curvature density parameter is motivated from the recently released observational evidences indicating the closed universe model at many standard deviations. Here we assume that the dark energy equation-of-state follows the PADE approximation, a generalized parametrization that may recover a variety of existing dark energy models. Considering three distinct PADE parametrizations, labeled as PADE-I, SPADE-I and PADE-II, we first constrain the cosmological scenarios driven by them using the joint analyses of a series of recently available cosmological probes, namely, Pantheon sample of Supernovae Type Ia, baryon acoustic oscillations, big bang nucleosynthesis, Hubble parameter measurements from cosmic chronometers, cosmic microwave background distance priors from Planck 2018 and then we include the future Gravitational Waves standard sirens (GWSS) data from the Einstein telescope with the combined analyses of these current cosmological probes. We find that the current cosmological probes indicate a very strong evidence of a dynamical dark energy at more than 99\% CL in both PADE-I, and PADE-II, but no significant evidence for the non-flat universe is found in any of these parametrizations. Interestingly, when the future GWSS data from the Einstein telescope are included with the standard cosmological probes an evidence of a non-flat universe is found in all three parametrizations together with a very strong preference of a dynamical dark energy at more than 99\% CL in both PADE-I, and PADE-II. Although from the information criteria analysis, namely, AIC, BIC, DIC, the non-flat $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model remains the best choice, but from DIC, PADE parametrizations are appealing.</p>

<p>2023-05-29, <strong>Gravitational waves from binary black holes in a self-interacting scalar dark matter cloud</strong>, Alexis Boudon et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18540v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.18540v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the imprints of accretion and dynamical friction on the gravitational-wave signals emitted by binary black holes embedded in a scalar dark matter cloud. As a key feature in this work, we focus on scalar fields with a repulsive self-interaction that balances against the self-gravity of the cloud. To a first approximation, the phase of the gravitational-wave signal receives extra correction terms at $-4$PN and $-5.5$PN orders, relative to the prediction of vacuum general relativity, due to accretion and dynamical friction, respectively. Future observations by LISA and B-DECIGO have the potential to detect these effects for a large range of scalar masses~$m_\mathrm{DM}$ and self-interaction couplings~$\lambda_4$; observations by ET and Advanced~LIGO could also detect these effects, albeit in a more limited region of parameter space. Crucially, we find that even if a dark matter cloud has a bulk density~$\rho_0$ that is too dilute to be detected via the effects of dynamical friction, the imprints of accretion could still be observable because it is controlled by the independent scale $\rho_a = 4 m_{\rm DM}^4 c^3/(3 \lambda_4 \hbar^3)$. In the models we consider, the infalling dark matter increases in density up to this characteristic scale $\rho_a$ near the Schwarzschild radius, which sets the accretion rate and its associated impact on the gravitational~waveform.</p>

<p>2023-05-29, <strong>Ultraviolet Sensitivity of Peccei–Quinn Inflation</strong>, Davide Dal Cin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18524v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.18524v1</a></p>

<p>The radial direction of the Peccei–Quinn field can drive cosmic inflation, given a non-minimal coupling to gravity. This scenario has been considered to simultaneously explain inflation, the strong $CP$ problem, and dark matter. We argue that Peccei–Quinn inflation is extremely sensitive to higher-dimensional operators. Further combining with the discussion on the axion quality required for solving the strong $CP$ problem, we examine the validity of this scenario. We also show that after Peccei–Quinn inflation, resonant amplifications of the field fluctuation is inevitably triggered.</p>

<p>2023-05-29, <strong>Dark matter vorticity and velocity dispersion from truncated Dyson$\unicode{x2013}$Schwinger equations</strong>, Alaric Erschfeld et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18517v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.18517v1</a></p>

<p>Large-scale structure formation is studied in a kinetic theory approach, extending the standard perfect pressureless fluid description for dark matter by including the velocity dispersion tensor as a dynamical degree of freedom. The evolution of power spectra for density, velocity and velocity dispersion degrees of freedom is investigated in a non-perturbative approximation scheme based on the Dyson$\unicode{x2013}$Schwinger equation. In particular, the generation of vorticity and velocity dispersion is studied and predictions for the corresponding power spectra are made, which qualitatively agree well with results obtained from $N$-body simulations. It is found that velocity dispersion grows strongly due to non-linear effects and at late times its mean value seems to be largely independent of the initial conditions. By taking this into account, a rather realistic picture of non-linear large-scale structure formation can be obtained, albeit the numerical treatment remains challenging, especially for very cold dark matter models.</p>

<p>2023-05-29, <strong>Unraveling the CMB lack-of-correlation anomaly with the cosmological gravitational wave background</strong>, Giacomo Galloni et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18184v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.18184v1</a></p>

<p>Since the very first observations, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) has revealed on large-scales unexpected features known as anomalies, which challenge the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model. One such anomaly is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lack-of-correlation'', where the measured two-point angular correlation function of CMB temperature anisotropies is compatible with zero, differently from the predictions of the standard model. This anomaly could indicate a deviation from the standard model, unknown systematics, or simply a rare realization of the model itself. In this study, we explore the possibility that the lack-of-correlation anomaly is a consequence of living in a rare realization of the standard model, by leveraging the potential information provided by the cosmological gravitational wave background (CGWB) detectable by future gravitational wave (GW) interferometers. We analyze both constrained and unconstrained realizations of the CGWB to investigate the extent of information that GWs can offer. To quantify the impact of the CGWB on the lack-of-correlation anomaly, we employ established estimators and introduce a new estimator that addresses the</code>look-elsewhere’’ effect. Additionally, we consider three different maximum multipoles, denoted as $\ell_{\rm max}$, to account for the anticipated capabilities of future GW detectors ($\ell_{\rm max} = 4, 6, 10$). Summarizing our findings for the case of $\ell_{\rm max} = 4$, we identify the angular range $[63^\circ - 180^\circ]$ as the region where future observations of the CGWB maximize the probability of rejecting the standard model. Furthermore, we calculate the expected significance of this observation, demonstrating that 98.81% (81.67%) of the GW realizations enhance the current significance of the anomaly when considering the full-sky (masked) Planck SMICA map as our CMB sky.</p>

<p>2023-05-30, <strong>Sources of primary cosmic rays</strong>, S. E. Pyatovsky et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18792v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.18792v1</a></p>

<p>In the paper, a comparative primary cosmic rays (PCR) comparative analysis by $E_0$ and the spectra of variable stars by periods is carried out in order to establish the causes of irregularities in the spectrum of PCR by $E_0$. The study was performed using the public database of the KASCADE-Grande experiment and GCVS and ZTF variable star catalogues. It has been suggested that the acceleration of PCR to high and super-high energies occurs not only on the shock waves of supernovae, but also in bursts of giants and super-giants. The relationship between the periods of variable stars and the maximum energy $E_0$ of the nuclei of PCRs generated by these types of stars is shown. Irregularities in the PCR spectrum by $E_0$ are associated with the transition from one dominant stars type to another as $E_0$ increases. The knee in the PCR spectrum at $E_0~=~3-5~PeV$ is associated with a decrease in the contribution of SRB variability stars and a further increase in the contribution of Mira variable stars to the PCR flux. The bump in the PCR spectrum with a maximum at $E_0~=~80~PeV$, established in the KASCADE-Grande experiment, is formed by giant stars and super-giants of the Mira and SRC variability.</p>

Considering three distinct PADE parametrizations, labeled as PADE-I, SPADE-I and PADE-II, we first constrain the cosmological scenarios driven by them using the joint analyses of a series of recently available cosmological probes, namely, Pantheon sample of Supernovae Type Ia, baryon acoustic oscillations, big bang nucleosynthesis, Hubble parameter measurements from cosmic chronometers, cosmic microwave background distance priors from Planck 2018 and then we include the future Gravitational Waves standard sirens (GWSS) data from the Einstein telescope with the combined analyses of these current cosmological probes. We find that the current cosmological probes indicate a very strong evidence of a dynamical dark energy at more than 99\% CL in both PADE-I, and PADE-II, but no significant evidence for the non-flat universe is found in any of these parametrizations. Interestingly, when the future GWSS data from the Einstein telescope are included with the standard cosmological probes an evidence of a non-flat universe is found in all three parametrizations together with a very strong preference of a dynamical dark energy at more than 99\% CL in both PADE-I, and PADE-II. Although from the information criteria analysis, namely, AIC, BIC, DIC, the non-flat $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model remains the best choice, but from DIC, PADE parametrizations are appealing.</p>

<p>Chemical elements in the hot medium permeating early-type galaxies, groups, and clusters make them an excellent laboratory for studying metal enrichment and cycling processes in the largest scales of the Universe. Here, we report the XMM-Newton RGS analysis of 14 early-type galaxies, including the well-known brightest cluster galaxies of Perseus, for instance. The spatial distribution of the O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe ratios is generally flat at the central 60 arcsecond regions of each object, irrespective of whether or not a central Fe abundance drop has been reported. Common profiles between noble gas and normal metal suggest that the dust depletion process does not work predominantly in these systems. Therefore, observed abundance drops are possibly attributed to other origins, like systematics in the atomic codes. Giant systems of high gas mass-to-luminosity ratio tend to hold a hot gas ($\sim$ 2 keV) yielding the solar N/Fe, O/Fe, Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe, and Ni/Fe ratios. Contrarily, light systems at a subkiloelectronvolt temperature regime, including isolated or group-centered galaxies, generally exhibit super-solar N/Fe, Ni/Fe, Ne/O, and Mg/O ratios. We find that the latest supernova nucleosynthesis models fail to reproduce such a super-solar abundance pattern. Possible systematic uncertainties contributing to these high abundance ratios of cool objects are also discussed in tandem with the crucial role of future X-ray missions.</p>

<p>2023-05-29, <strong>Magnetar Flare-Driven Bumpy Declining Light Curves in Hydrogen-poor Superluminous Supernovae</strong>, Xiao-Fei Dong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17983v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.17983v1</a></p>

<p>Recent observations indicate that hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae often display bumpy declining light curves. However, the cause of these undulations remains unclear. In this paper, we have improved the magnetar model, which includes flare activities. We present a systematic analysis of a well-observed SLSNe-I sample with bumpy light curves in the late-phase. These SLSNe-I were identified from multiple transient surveys, such as the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1 MDS) and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Our study provides a set of magnetar-powered model light curve fits for five SLSNe-I, which accurately reproduce observed light curves using reasonable physical parameters. By extracting essential characteristics of both explosions and central engines, these fits provide valuable insights into investigating their potential association with gamma ray burst engines. We found that the SLSN flares tend to be the dim and long extension of the GRB flares in the peak luminosity versus peak time plane. Conducting large-scale, high cadence surveys in the near future could enhance our comprehension of both SLSN undulation properties and their potential relationship with GRBs by modeling their light curve characteristics.</p>

<p>2023-05-29, <strong>Type W and Type 15bn subgroups of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae: pre-maximum diversity, post-maximum homogeneity?</strong>, Réka Könyves-Tóth et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17963v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.17963v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, we analyze the post-maximum spectra of a sample of 27 Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) in order to search for physical differences between the so-called Type W and Type 15bn sub-types. This paper is a continuation of \citet{ktr21} and \citet{ktr22}. In the former, it was revealed that not all SLSNe-I show the W-shaped absorption feature between 4000 and 5000 \AA\ in the pre-maximum spectra, and two new SLSN-subgroups were disclosed: Type W, where the W-shaped feature is present, and Type 15bn, where it is missing. In the latter, it was shown that the pre-maximum photosphere of Type W SLSNe-I tend to be hotter compared to Type 15bn objects, and they are different regarding their ion composition, their early light curves and their geometry as well. For completeness, post-maximum data are analyzed in this paper. It is concluded that in terms of photospheric temperature and velocity, Type W and Type 15bn SLSNe decrease to a similar value by the post-maximum phases, and their pseudo-nebular spectra are nearly uniform. Pseudo-equivalent width calculations show that the pEW of the wavelength range between 4166 and 5266 \AA\ evolve differently in case of the two sub-types, while the other parts of the spectra seem to evolve similarly. It was found that the host galaxies of the studied objects do not differ significantly in their star formation rate, morphology, stellar mass and absolute brightness. The main difference behind the bimodality of Type W and Type 15bn SLSNe-I therefore is in their pre-maximum evolution.</p>
