<p>2025-08-26, <strong>Fine-Tuning Vision-Language Models for Neutrino Event Analysis in High-Energy Physics Experiments</strong>, Dikshant Sagar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19376v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.19376v1</a></p>

<p>Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown strong potential for multimodal reasoning beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the use of a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM), based on LLaMA 3.2, for classifying neutrino interactions from pixelated detector images in high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark its performance against an established CNN baseline used in experiments like NOvA and DUNE, evaluating metrics such as classification accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. Our results show that the VLM not only matches or exceeds CNN performance but also enables richer reasoning and better integration of auxiliary textual or semantic context. These findings suggest that VLMs offer a promising general-purpose backbone for event classification in HEP, paving the way for multimodal approaches in experimental neutrino physics.</p>

<p>2025-08-26, <strong>Single pion-production and pion propagation in Achilles</strong>, Joshua Isaacson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19213v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.19213v1</a></p>

<p>We extend the applicability of Achilles (A CHIcagoLand Lepton Event Simulator) by incorporating the single-pion production mechanism in a fully exclusive fashion. The electroweak interaction vertex is modeled by combining the state-of-the-art Dynamical Coupled-Channels approach with realistic hole spectral functions, which account for correlations in both the initial target state and the residual spectator system. Final-state interactions are treated using a semi-classical intranuclear cascade that leverages nuclear configurations to determine the correlated spatial distribution of protons and neutrons. The meson-baryon scattering amplitudes used in the cascade are computed within the Dynamical Coupled-Channels framework, consistent with the electroweak vertex. To model pion absorption, we employ the optical potential approach of Oset and Salcedo. As an alternative approach, we explicitly model the production and propagation of resonances which mediate pion-nucleon scattering and pion absorption. We validate out approach against pion-nucleon and pion-nucleus scattering data, and present comparisons with electron- and neutrino-nucleus measurements from e4$\nu$, T2K, MINER$\nu$A, and MicroBooNE.</p>

<p>2025-08-26, <strong>SN2023syz and SN2025cbj: Two Type IIn Supernovae Associated with IceCube High-energy Neutrinos</strong>, Ming-Xuan Lu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19080v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.19080v1</a></p>

<p>Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are a subclass of core-collapse SNe in which strong interactions occur between the ejecta and dense circumstellar material, creating ideal conditions for the production of high-energy neutrinos. This makes them promising candidate sources of neutrinos. In this work, we conduct an association study between 163 SNe IIn observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility and 138 neutrino alert events detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory. After excluding alerts with poor localization, we find two SNe that are spatiotemporally coincident with neutrino events. IC231027A and IC250421A coincide with the positions of SN2023syz and SN2025cbj, respectively, within their localization uncertainties, and the neutrino arrival times are delayed by 38 days and 61 days relative to the discovery times of the corresponding SNe. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that the probability of such two coincidences occurring by chance in our sample is $p \sim 0.67\%$, suggesting a high likelihood that they arise from genuine associations, though the result is not yet statistical significant. Furthermore, model calculations show that the expected numbers of neutrino events from these SNe IIn could be consistent with the actual observations. Our study provides possible evidence that interacting SNe may be potential neutrino-emitting sources.</p>

<p>2025-08-26, <strong>Perturbative and nonperturbative aspects of neutrino oscillations in quantum field theory</strong>, Massimo Blasone et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18917v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18917v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we present a comprehensive and pedagogical review of two quantum field theoretical approaches to neutrino flavor mixing and oscillations: the non-perturbative flavor Fock space formalism and the perturbative interaction picture framework.</p>

<p>2025-08-26, <strong>Structure of leptonic Yukawa couplings in the Zee model</strong>, Chuan-Hung Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18757v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18757v1</a></p>

<p>The radiative neutrino mass matrix $m^\nu$ in the Zee model depends on leptonic Yukawa couplings $F$ to a singlet scalar and $Y^\ell$ to a new Higgs doublet. Leveraging the skew-symmetric structure of $F$, we derive a unique identity linking $F$ and $m^\nu$ that is explicitly independent of $Y^\ell$. This relation implies that five entries of $Y^\ell$ can, in principle, be determined directly from $m^\nu$ and $F$, while the remaining four can be selected based on phenomenological assumptions. As an illustration, we apply this framework to the two-zero texture $B2$, highlighting its enhancement of the muon $g-2$.</p>

<p>2025-08-26, <strong>A $Z_4$ Scotogenic Model with Higgs Portal</strong>, Noel Jonathan Jobu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18713v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18713v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a new Scotogenic type model based on a global $Z_4$ symmetry involving dark matter candidates. After the symmetry breaking as $Z_4$ to $Z_2$ via the singlet scalar vacuum expectation value (VEV), the lightest Majorana fermion works as a viable thermal freeze-out dark matter (DM) candidate, and the mass terms for active neutrinos are generated as a finite quantum correction at the 1-loop level. A key point of realising our Scotogenic structure is to introduce two types of Majorana fermions (heavy right-handed neutrinos) and inert Higgs doublets with opposite $Z_4$ parities. Since a large VEV for the singlet scalar is not so harmful in an appropriate realisation of the Higgs mechanism for the SM gauge symmetry, we can naturally realise a TeV-scale fermionic DM candidate, where constraints via direct detection experiments are less than those for sub-TeV DM. Our scenario involves the Higgs-portal DM interactions, which help the realisation of the correct DM relic abundance. Relying on the structure of the model, it is possible to find a natural partner for coannihilation. Our scenario can be investigated via the measurement of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling at the Large Hadron Collider. The simplest way to evade the domain-wall problem by adding a tiny soft $Z_2$ breaking term works, keeping a sufficient longevity of the decaying DM lifetime.</p>

<p>2025-08-26, <strong>One texture zero for Dirac neutrinos in a diagonal charged lepton basis</strong>, Richard H. Benavides et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18611v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18611v1</a></p>

<p>An analytic and numerical systematic study of the neutrino mass matrix $M_\nu$ with one texture zero in a basis where the charged leptons are diagonal, and under the assumption that neutrinos are Dirac particles, is carried through in detail. Our study is done without any approximation, first analytically and then numerically. Current neutrino oscillation data are used in our calculations. The analysis done constraints the parameter space in such a way that among the six possible one texture zero patterns, only four turn out to be favored by current neutrino oscillation data at the $3\sigma$ level. Phenomenological implications on the lepton CP violation phase and neutrino masses are explored.</p>

<p>2025-08-26, <strong>Search for the radiative decay of the cosmic neutrino background through spectral measurements of the cosmic infrared background using PRIMA</strong>, Yuji Takeuchi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18590v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18590v1</a></p>

<p>We propose to search for a faint yet distinguishable contribution to the cosmic infrared background (CIB) spectrum arising from the radiative decay of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B). In the Standard Model of particle physics, neutrino decay is highly suppressed, with a predicted lifetime on the order of $10^{43}$ years. However, non-standard models suggest the possibility of significantly shorter lifetimes, ranging from $10^{12}$ to $10^{17}$ years. Observations to date, however, only provide a lower limit of approximately $10^{12}$ years for the neutrino lifetime. In PRIMAâs low-resolution mode ($R \sim 100$), a diffuse background analysis, combined with the removal of point sources associated with known galaxies in a wide-field ($\sim 1$ square degree) spectroscopic survey covering in the 24-240 $\mu$m range could facilitate a search for neutrino decay lifetimes up to $O(10^{15})$ years. The expected signal from C$\nu$B decay at 50 $\mu$m for a neutrino lifetime of $O(10^{15})$ years is more than an order of magnitude fainter than the CIB and over three orders of magnitude fainter than the zodiacal emission foreground. Taking advantage of the characteristic spectral features of C$\nu$B decay, this level of sensitivity can be achieved with approximately 100 hours of total observation time, based on estimated surface brightness sensitivity. Searching for neutrino decay at this sensitivity could place strong constraints on several non-standard theories. A positive detection would provide compelling evidence for non-standard contributions to neutrino decay and could directly reveal the cosmic neutrino background. Furthermore, the decay photon spectrum could offer insights into the absolute mass of neutrinos, and key cosmological parameters.</p>

<p>2025-08-26, <strong>Results of the LEGEND-200 experiment in the search for neutrinoless double beta decay</strong>, Carmen Romo-Luque et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18573v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18573v1</a></p>

<p>The LEGEND experiment is looking for the extremely rare neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay of $^{76}$Ge using isotopically-enriched high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. The detection of this process would imply that the neutrino is a Majorana particle and the total lepton number would not be conserved, which could be related to the cosmological asymmetry between matter and antimatter through leptogenesis. The long-term goal of the collaboration is LEGEND-1000: a 1-ton detector array planned to run for 10 years, with a projected half-life sensitivity exceeding $10^{28}$ years, fully covering the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. A first search for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay has been carried out by LEGEND-200 building on the experience gained from GERDA and the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR. The experiment has been collecting physics data for a year at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy with 140 kg of HPGe detectors. With a total exposure of 61 kg yr, LEGEND-200 has achieved a background index of $5^{+3}_{-2}\times10^{-4}$ counts/(keV kg yr) in the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay signal region from the highest performing detectors. After combining the results from GERDA, the MAJORANA Demonstrator and LEGEND-200, an exclusion sensitivity $ &gt; 2.8\times10^{26}$ yr has been obtained at 90\% confidence level for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay half-life, with no evidence for a signal. A new observed lower limit of $T^{0\nu}_{1/2} &gt; 1.9\times10^{26}$ yr at 90\% confidence level has been established.</p>

<p>2025-08-27, <strong>Multi-channel, multi-template event reconstruction for SuperCDMS data using machine learning</strong>, M. F. Albakry et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20090v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.20090v1</a></p>

<p>SuperCDMS SNOLAB uses kilogram-scale germanium and silicon detectors to search for dark matter. Each detector has Transition Edge Sensors (TESs) patterned on the top and bottom faces of a large crystal substrate, with the TESs electrically grouped into six phonon readout channels per face. Noise correlations are expected among a detectorâs readout channels, in part because the channels and their readout electronics are located in close proximity to one another. Moreover, owing to the large size of the detectors, energy deposits can produce vastly different phonon propagation patterns depending on their location in the substrate, resulting in a strong position dependence in the readout-channel pulse shapes. Both of these effects can degrade the energy resolution and consequently diminish the dark matter search sensitivity of the experiment if not accounted for properly. We present a new algorithm for pulse reconstruction, mathematically formulated to take into account correlated noise and pulse shape variations. This new algorithm fits N readout channels with a superposition of M pulse templates simultaneously - hence termed the N$\times$M filter. We describe a method to derive the pulse templates using principal component analysis (PCA) and to extract energy and position information using a gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT). We show that these new N$\times$M and GBDT analysis tools can reduce the impact from correlated noise sources while improving the reconstructed energy resolution for simulated mono-energetic events by more than a factor of three and for the 71Ge K-shell electron-capture peak recoils measured in a previous version of SuperCDMS called CDMSlite to $&lt;$ 50 eV from the previously published value of $\sim$100 eV. These results lay the groundwork for position reconstruction in SuperCDMS with the N$\times$M outputs.</p>

<p>2025-08-27, <strong>A cryogenic chamber setup for superfluid helium experiments with optical fiber and electrical access</strong>, Alexander R. Korsch et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19962v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.19962v1</a></p>

<p>Superfluid helium is a prototypical quantum liquid. As such, it has been a prominent platform for the study of quantum many body physics. More recently, the outstanding mechanical and optical properties of superfluid helium, such as low mechanical dissipation and low optical absorption, have positioned superfluid helium as a promising material platform in applications ranging from dark matter and gravitational wave detection to quantum computation. However, experiments with superfluid helium incur a high barrier to entry as they require incorporation of complex optical and electrical setups within a hermetically sealed cryogenic chamber to confine the superfluid. Here, we report on the design and construction of a helium chamber setup for operation inside a dilution refrigerator at Millikelvin temperatures, featuring electrical and optical fiber access. By incorporating an automated gas handling system, we can precisely control the amount of helium gas inserted into the chamber, rendering our setup particularly promising for experiments with superfluid helium thin films, such as superfluid thin film optomechanics. Using silicon nanophotonic resonators, we demonstrate precise control and in-situ tuning of the thickness of a superfluid helium film on the sub-nanometer level. By making use of the exceptional tunability of the superfluid film thickness, we demonstrate optomechanically induced phonon lasing of phononic crystal cavity third sound modes in the superfluid film and show that the lasing threshold crucially depends on the film thickness. The large internal volume of our chamber (V_chamber = 1l) is adaptable for integration of various optical and electrical measurement and control techniques. Therefore, our setup provides a versatile platform for a variety of experiments in fundamental and applied superfluid helium research.</p>

<p>2025-08-27, <strong>Chaplygin and Polytropic gases Teleparallel Robertson-Walker $F(T)$ gravity solutions</strong>, Alexandre Landry et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19912v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.19912v1</a></p>

<p>This paper investigates the Teleparallel Robertson-Walker (TRW) $F(T)$ gravity solutions for a Chaplygin gas, and then for any polytropic gas cosmological source. We use the TRW $F(T)$ gravity field equations (FEs) for each $k$-parameter value case and the relevant gas equation of state (EoS) to find the new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. For flat $k=0$ cosmological case, we find analytical solutions valid for any cosmological scale factor. For curved $k=\pm 1$ cosmological cases, we find new approximated teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for slow, linear, fast and very fast universe expansion cases summarizing by a double power-law function. All the new solutions will be relevant for future cosmological applications on dark matter, dark energy (DE) quintessence, phantom energy, Anti-deSitter (AdS) spacetimes and several other cosmological processes.</p>

<p>2025-08-27, <strong>Signature of a Dark Ultra-compact Dwarf Galaxy Transiting the Milky Way Disk</strong>, Ken Udagawa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19643v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.19643v1</a></p>

<p>We report the discovery of a vertical velocity anomaly (VVA) in the stellar component of the Galactic disk, consistent with the impact of a dark, ultra-compact dwarf galaxy (UCD)-sized object plunging into the Milky Way. The anomaly spatially coincides with a suite of gaseous disturbances â including an \Hone\ void, a molecular shell (CO 16.134â0.553), and a vertical \Hone\ filament â previously interpreted as signatures of a dark matter subhalo (DMSH) collision. Analysis of Gaia DR2 astrometry reveals a statistically significant vertical velocity dip co-located with these features, supporting a dynamical origin. The absence of a luminous source at the filamentâs terminus suggests a dark or failed UCD. These results provide rare observational evidence for a low-mass DMSH, with implications for the substructure of dark matter halos and constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model.</p>

<p>2025-08-27, <strong>Gravitational Microlensing of the Galactic Centre $Î³$-Ray Excess: A New Test for Point-Like or Extended Emission?</strong>, Nada Salama et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19577v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.19577v1</a></p>

<p>We present a potential test of the origin of the $\gamma$-ray Galactic Centre Excess (GCE). We demonstrate how gravitational microlensing by stellar mass objects along the line of sight to the Galactic Bulge can distinguish between the possibility of extensive emission due to dark matter self-annihilation from more prosaic astrophysical sources, namely millisecond pulsars. Such an astrophysical origin would result in emission from a population of small, currently unresolved point-like sources - in contrast to the expected smoother emission resulting from dark matter annihilation. Given that the scale of gravitational microlensing, that is, the Einstein radius for stellar mass lenses, and hence, the degree of induced magnification, is sensitive to the size of the emitting region, such microlensing will induce time variability in the emission of astrophysical sources, whereas $\gamma$-ray emission from dark matter annihilation will effectively be immune to such influences. However, we find that detecting microlensing-induced variability requires significantly greater sensitivity than that of current or planned $\gamma$-ray detectors. For a small population of bright GCE sources, more than an order-of-magnitude increase in effective area over Fermi-LAT would be required, with events remaining extremely rare. For a large population of faint sources, events would occur multiple times a year, but would only be detectable with a four-order-of-magnitude improvement. Whilst microlensing might not be a definitive test of the origin of the GCE, in future observations, it may prove useful in determining the properties of any point-like source population.</p>

<p>The galaxy LEDA 1313424 has recently been discovered to have nine rings [1]. The authors of the discovery paper interpret the rings to be the result of the passing of a smaller galaxy through the center of the LEDA galaxy 56 Myr ago. We point out several difficulties with this interpretation and propose instead that the rings of LEDA are the imprint upon baryonic matter of caustic rings of dark matter. Caustic rings of dark matter, with the pattern of radii observed in the LEDA galaxy, form if the dark matter is axions. Because they move slowly (LEDAâs 70 kpc ring, for example, has speed 6.6 km/s) caustic rings of dark matter are plausible sites for the star formation observed in LEDA.</p>

<p>We present a high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a group of field dwarf galaxies which includes on-the-fly radiative transfer (RT) and is evolved to $z=0$. Emission from stars is included according to age-dependent spectra, and a redshift-dependent UV background. The inclusion of RT results in the formation of eight additional faint dwarf galaxies with stellar masses of $10^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$ to several $10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ and only old stellar populations, similar to the observed Ultra-Faint Dwarf galaxies. They formed before and during cosmic reionisation and were mostly quenched by $z \sim 3-4$. The simulated galaxies follow many observed scaling relations such as the stellar mass-halo mass relation, the mass-size relation, and the luminosity-velocity dispersion relation. For the more massive dwarf galaxies, radiative feedback suppresses star formation, making it less bursty and reducing explosive outflows. This consequently reduces the dark matter core sizes by a factor of 2-3, rendering the core sizes ($\sim$ 1 kpc) more consistent with observations. The distribution of HI in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is ubiquitous with a covering fraction of unity within $R_{vir}$, in good agreement with observations. It is rather insensitive to radiative or SN feedback at $z=0$, but at $z&gt;5$ it is much higher in the RT simulation. In contrast, the distribution of low ions like SiII is very compact and declines sharply beyond the ISM scale. CIV and OVI have a more extended distribution, but their column densities are generally below the detection limit. Radiative feedback leads to smaller column densities of the metal ions, partly due to the reduction of total metal production, and partly because hard photons from the stellar radiation escape the ISM and further ionise the CGM. The abundance of CIV is particularly sensitive to the latter effect.</p>

<p>2025-08-26, <strong>Observational bounds on Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars from Gravitational Wave Data</strong>, Rafael M. Santos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19382v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.19382v1</a></p>

<p>Recent gravitational-wave (GW) observations offer a unique opportunity to probe the fundamental nature of compact objects. A growing body of research has focused on exploring the role of dark matter (DM) through the concept of DM-admixed neutron stars (NSs), where the presence of DM can significantly alter key physical properties of NSs, such as their mass, radius, and tidal deformability, ultimately affecting the predicted GW waveform emitted during binary coalescences. In this work, we present a novel observational test that, for the first time, places constraints on the influence of DM inside NSs using real GW data. By reanalyzing signals from events such as GW230529, GW200115, and GW200105, we derive new upper bounds on the DM fraction, $F_{\chi}$, and particle mass, $m_{\chi}$, under the assumption that DM is described by a scalar field with a self-interaction potential. We find that the upper bound on $F_{\chi}$ depends on the specific binary system under analysis, indicating that different DM configurations can be consistent with observations in different ways. In particular, the event GW190814 may be compatible with a DM halo configuration. In contrast, the other events analyzed (GW230529, GW200105 and GW200115) are consistent with DM forming a core inside the NS, yielding strong upper bounds on $F_{\chi}$. The corresponding values for the mass scale $m_{\chi}$ are also discussed in the text. This work offers a new approach to probing DM in the context of compact NS objects through GW observations.</p>

Marchegiani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19354v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.19354v1</a></p>

<p>We study the impact of the recent observation of the radio halo in the Coma galaxy cluster at 6.6 GHz with the Sardinia Radio Telescope on models based on turbulent reacceleration of electrons produced in dark matter annihilation processes. Observing at that frequency it is possible to obtain information on the electrons spectrum at energies where the effect of turbulent reacceleration becomes sub-dominant with respect to energy losses, and therefore to obtain information on the properties of seed electrons. Under the assumption that dark matter particles are neutralino-like particles annihilating at a rate close to the maximum allowed by Fermi-LAT upper limits in dwarf galaxies, we obtain some constraints on the intensity of the reacceleration and on the value of the neutralino mass. In particular, models with mass of the order of 10 GeV are generally disfavored, because they produce a high-frequency radio spectrum that can not reproduce the possible flattening observed between 5 and 6.6 GHz; on the other hand, models with mass of the order of 500 GeV, in order to reproduce the observed spectrum at frequencies below 100 MHz, require a reacceleration phase longer than $10^9$ yr, which would require more than one event responsible of the generation of turbulence in the cluster. The resulting optimal mass values are in the range 100â200 GeV, with a preference for the quark annihilation channel.</p>

<p>As a benchmark for galaxy evolution and dark matter studies, the total mass of the Milky Way is a parameter of cosmological significance, and its value at large radii from the Galactic center remains highly uncertain. Following a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach, we measure the cumulative mass of the Milky Way using full 6D phase-space information of stars from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We employ 330 blue horizontal-branch stars (BHBs) and 110 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) in DESI covering Galactocentric distances in the range $\sim$50â100 kpc. Within 100 kpc from the Galactic center, we report an enclosed mass of $M(&lt;100\ {\rm kpc}) = 0.57^{+0.08}_{-0.07}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and $M(&lt;100\ {\rm kpc}) = 0.55^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ when using BHBs and RRLs, respectively. Extrapolating our mass profiles beyond the extent of our data, we find the virial mass of the Galaxy to be $M_{200}=0.85^{+0.16}_{-0.14}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and $M_{200}=0.78^{+0.19}_{-0.15}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$, respectively. We validate the effectiveness and limitations of our method using mock BHBs and RRLs from two AuriDESI halos. These tests show that the code recovers the enclosed mass of the mock galaxy with high precision and accuracy between 50 and 200 kpc, independent of the stellar tracer used and their spatial distribution. The tests also suggest an underestimation of the galaxyâs cumulative mass at a level of up to $\sim20$\% if stars close to the Galactic center are used in the models. Our mass estimates lay the groundwork for future inference of the Galactic mass with upcoming DESI data releases and spectroscopic surveys mapping the halo.</p>

<p>Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are compelling candidates for explaining the present-day relic abundance of cold dark matter (CDM), yet their formation typically requires finely tuned early-universe dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel PBH formation mechanism within a well-established magnetogenesis framework. This scenario simultaneously accounts for the large-scale magnetic fields observed today and generates an enhanced curvature power spectrum at intermediate scales, leading to PBH formation with masses that can survive until the present epoch. We identify a narrow reheating temperature range, $10^5\,\mathrm{GeV} \leq T_{re} \leq 3\times 10^5\,\mathrm{GeV}$, within which the resulting PBHs can constitute the entirety of the observed CDM abundance. Furthermore, our model predicts a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background as a byproduct of the PBH formation process. Remarkably, the predicted GW signal lies within the sensitivity reach of upcoming space-based interferometers, such as the LISA, DECIGO, or SKA mission, offering a direct observational probe of this PBH generation mechanism.</p>

<p>2025-08-26, <strong>Probing the HI distribution at small scales using 21-cm Intensity Mapping at large scales</strong>, Minal Chhabra et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19126v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.19126v1</a></p>

<p>Neutral hydrogen (HI) 21-cm Intensity Mapping (IM) holds the potential to map the large-scale structures in the Universe over a wide redshift range $(z \lesssim 5.5)$, measure cosmological parameters, and shed light on the nature of dark energy. In addition, the signal is also sensitive to how the HI is distributed among the dark matter haloes, this being quantified through the HIHM relation, which relates the HI mass to the halo mass. In this work, we investigate whether measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum (PS) and bispectrum (BS) at large scales can be used to estimate the HIHM relation, which quantifies the HI distribution at small scales. As a proof of concept, we consider the simulated 21-cm IM signal at $z=1$. We find that the measured 21-cm PS and BS at large scales $(k \le k_{ul} = 0.32 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ are well modeled using perturbation theory, with only two free parameters namely $[\Omega_{\rm HI} b_1]$ and $\gamma = b_2/b_1$. Combining the measured 21-cm PS and BS with an independent measurement of $\Omega_{\rm HI} $, we show that it is possible to estimate the three parameters that quantify the HIHM relation. We expect observational estimates of the HIHM relation to shed light on galaxy formation and the evolution of the ISM. Our preliminary analysis ignores redshift space distortion and the system noise in IM observations, which we plan to address in future work.</p>

<p>The dSphs around the Milky Way are commonly considered as systems that are supported by velocity dispersion against self-gravitation. They have been long accounted among the best targets to search for indirect DM signatures in the GeV-to-TeV gamma-rays due to absence of astrophysical gamma-ray foreground or background emission. We present forecasts on the sensitivity of the future CTAO for the search for annihilating or decaying DM in such targets. We perform an original selection of candidates out of the current catalog of known objects, including both classical and ultra-faint targets. For each of them, we calculate the expected amount of DM using the most updated and complete available samples of photometric and spectroscopic data of member stars, adopting a common framework of data treatment for both classes of objects. In this way, we are able to generate novel astrophysical factor profiles for general indirect DM searches that we compare with the current literature. Out of a starting sample of 64 dSphs, we highlight the 8 most promising targets - DraI, CBe, UMaII, UMi and Wil1 in the Northern hemisphere; RetII, Scl and SgrII in the Southern hemisphere - for which different DM density models (either cored or cuspy) lead to similar expectations, at variance with what happens for other DM targets - thus resulting in more robust predictions. We find that CTAO will provide the strongest limits above ~10 TeV, down to values of velocity-averaged annihilation cross section of ~5$ \times 10^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and up to decay lifetimes of ~10$^{26}$ s for combined limits on the best targets. We argue that the largest source of inaccuracy is due to the still imprecise determination of the DM content, especially for ultra-faint dSphs. We propose possible strategies of observation for CTAO, either optimized on a deep focus on the best known candidates, or on the diversification of targets.</p>

<p>The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment is searching for dark matter interactions in a liquid xenon time projection chamber (LXe-TPC). This article demonstrates how control of the flow state in the LXe-TPC enables the identification of pairs of sequential alpha-decays, which are used to map fluid flow and ion drift in the liquid target. The resulting transport model is used to tag $^{214}$Pb beta-decays, a leading background to dark matter signals in LZ. Temporally evolving volume selections, at a cost of 9.0% of exposure, target the decay of each $^{214}$Pb atom up to 81 minutes after production, resulting in (63 $\pm$ 6$_{\mathrm{stat}}$ $\pm$ 7$_{\mathrm{sys}}$)% identification of $^{214}$Pb decays to ground state. We also demonstrate how flow-based tagging techniques enable a novel calibration side band that is concurrent with science data.</p>

<p>In interacting dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) scenarios, the interaction function typically includes a coupling parameter $\xi$ that quantifies the strength of energy exchange between the dark sectors. While $\xi$ is often assumed to be constant, there is no fundamental reason to exclude a time-dependent coupling, which could provide a more general and realistic description of dark sector dynamics. In this work, we study two widely used interacting models involving pressureless DM and DE, where the coupling parameter is allowed to vary with the scale factor $a$. Specifically, we consider two parametrizations: $\xi(a) = \xi_0 + \xi_a (1-a)$ and $\xi(a) = \xi_0 \left(1 + \frac{1-a}{a^2 + (1-a)^2} \right)$, and constrain them using the latest cosmological observations, including Planck 2018 CMB data, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and multiple Type Ia supernovae samples. Our results show that one scenario yields evidence for a non-zero interaction at more than 95\% confidence level, while the remaining cases indicate at most mild or inconclusive signs of interaction. These findings highlight the potential of variable coupling models and the importance of continued investigation into the nature of the dark sectors.</p>

<p>Motivated by recent results from the DESI collaboration, we explore two classes of quintessence models that can give rise to crossing of the dark energy equation of state through the ``phantom divideââ $w=-1$. These are models with Lagrangians that involve higher powers of the kinetic energy $\dot\phi^2$, or where the dark matter (DM) mass is a function of $\phi$. Both have similar features with respect to the reconstructed redshift-dependent $w(z)$: moderate tuning of parameters is required to achieve the desired shape, and it is difficult or impossible for $w(z)$ to continue evolving smoothly as $z$ becomes large. Nevertheless, they give a strong improvement over $\Lambda$CDM in fitting the data. We point out that models of coupled dark matter and dark energy that cross the phantom divide are under pressure from constraints on long-range DM forces. They rule out the simplest renormalizable coupling of scalar DM to quintessence, but leave the fermionic case marginally allowed, while exponentially coupled models are safe from current constraints.</p>

<p>Are the most massive objects in the Universe today the direct descendants of the most massive objects at higher redshift? We address this question by tracing the evolutionary histories of haloes in the MultiDark Planck2 simulation. By following the 100 most massive halos at $z = 0$ across cosmic time, we find that only 40\% of them were among the largest 100 halos at $z = 1$. This suggests that many of todayâs most massive clusters were not the most dominant structures at earlier times, while some of the most massive objects at high redshift do not remain in the top mass ranks at later epochs. The hierarchical nature of structure formation predicts that, on average, massive haloes grow over time, with their abundance in comoving space decreasing rapidly at higher redshifts. However, individual clusters exhibit diverse evolutionary paths: some undergo early rapid growth, while others experience steady accretion or significant merger-driven mass changes. A key assumption in self-similar models of cluster evolution is that the most massive objects maintain their rank in the mass hierarchy across cosmic time. In this work, we test this assumption by constructing a mass-complete sample of haloes within the $(1 h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ volume of MultiDark and analysing when clusters enter and exit a high-mass-selected sample. Our results demonstrate that cluster selections must be carefully constructed, as significant numbers of objects can enter and leave the sample over time. These findings have important implications for observational cluster selection and comparisons between simulations and surveys, especially at high redshift.</p>

<p>We present very high-energy optical photometry and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024bch in the nearby galaxy NGC 3206 (\sim 20 Mpc). We used gamma-ray observations performed with the first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) and optical observations with the Liverpool Telescope (LT) combined with data from public repositories to evaluate the general properties of the event and the progenitor star. No significant emission above the LST-1 energy threshold for this observation (\sim 100 GeV) was detected in the direction of SN 2024bch, and we computed an integral upper limit on the photon flux of F_\gamma(&gt;100 GeV) \le 3.61 \times 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} based on six nonconsecutive nights of observations with the LST-1, between 16 and 38 days after the explosion. Employing a general model for the gamma-ray flux emission, we found an upper limit on the mass-loss-rate to wind-velocity ratio of \dot M/u_{w} \le 10^{-4} \frac{M_\odot}{yr}\frac{s}{km}, although gamma-gamma absorption could potentially have skewed this estimation, effectively weakening our constraint. From spectro-photometric observations we found progenitor parameters of M_{pr} = 11 - 20 M_\odot and R_{pr} = 531 \pm 125 R_\odot. Finally, using archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope, we constrained the luminosity of the progenitor star to log(L_{pr}/L_\odot) \le 4.82 and its effective temperature to T_{pr} \le 4000 K. Our results suggest that SN 2024bch is a type IIn-L supernova that originated from a progenitor star consistent with a red supergiant. We show how the correct estimation of the mass-loss history of a supernova will play a major role in future multiwavelength observations.</p>

B. Newman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20023v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.20023v1</a></p>

<p>Though type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are found in all types of galaxies, recent local Hubble constant measurements have disfavored using SNe Ia in early-type or quiescent galaxies, aiming instead for better consistency with SNe Ia in star-forming, late-type host galaxies calibrated by Cepheid distances. Here we investigate the feasibility of a parallel distance ladder using SNe Ia exclusively in quiescent, massive ($\log M_*/M_{\odot} \geq 10$) host galaxies, calibrated by tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances. We present TRGB measurements to four galaxies: three measured from the Hubble Space Telescope with the ACS F814W filter, and one measured from the JWST NIRCam F090W filter. Combined with literature measurements, we define a TRGB calibrator sample of five high-mass, early-type galaxies that hosted well-measured SNe Ia: NGC 1316 (SN 2006dd), NGC 1380 (SN 1992A), NGC 1404 (SN 2007on, SN 2011iv), NGC 4457 (SN 2020nvb), and NGC 4636 (SN 2020ue). We jointly standardize these calibrators with a fiducial sample of 124 Hubble-flow SNe Ia from the Zwicky Transient Facility that are matched in host-galaxy and light-curve properties. Our results with this homogenized subsample show a Hubble residual scatter of under 0.11 mag, lower than usually observed in cosmological samples of the full SN~Ia distribution. We obtain a measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 75.3 \pm 2.9$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, including statistical and estimated systematic uncertainties, and discuss the potential to further improve the precision of this approach. As calibrator and supernova samples grow, we advocate that future cosmological applications of SNe Ia use subsamples matched in host-galaxy and supernova properties across redshift.</p>

<p>We analyze binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the latest Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) using a flexible, non-parametric framework to infer the underlying black hole mass distribution. Our model employs Gaussian Processes (GPs) with astrophysically motivated priors to represent the mass distribution, assuming both component masses are independently drawn from a common mass function. This approach enables us to capture complex features in the population without relying on rigid parametric forms. Motivated by predictions from binary stellar evolution, we focus on the presence of a mass gap in the range $40-120~ M_\odot$, attributed to the pair-instability supernova (PISN) and pulsational PISN (PPISN) processes. Using our GP-based model, we find for the first time, strong evidence for the onset of this mass gap, locating its lower edge at approximately $45-60 ~M_\odot$. We observe a suppression in the BBH merger rate when comparing the latest constraints against our GP model, by a factor of $10-60$ at $\sim60~M_\odot$, corresponding to the minimum of the mass gap. Additionally, we find evidence of a subpopulation of mergers populating the mass gap around $70 ~M_\odot$, which we argue is due to hierarchical mergers, as well as of a feature in the $40-50~ M_\odot$ range, albeit with low significance, which we attribute to the predicted PPISN build up. We discuss the astrophysical implications of this result in light of GW231123, a recently reported BBH merger with a total mass potentially above the PISN gap, suggesting the need for revised models of massive stellar evolution or alternative formation channels.</p>

<p>We report the discovery of diffuse radio emission within SNR G338.3-0.0 using new MeerKAT observations at 816 MHz and 1.4 GHz. The radio emission spatially overlaps with the X-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by PSR J1640-4631 and the GeV/TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1640-465. The morphology of this radio emission is centrally peaked and its extent is well-contained within the SNR shell. A lack of mid- and far-infrared counterparts and the absence of catalogued H II regions argues against a thermal origin, while the morphology and radial profile are suggestive of a PWN origin powered by PSR J1640-4631. Under this assumption, we use a one-zone, time dependant model to reproduce the size and broadband (radio, X-ray, and gamma-rays) spectral energy distribution of the PWN. The modelling and broadband properties of this PWN suggests it is currently interacting with the reverse shock within its host SNR. This evolutionary stage is associated with particles escaping the PWN and entering the ISM, suggesting this object may be an important source of Galactic PeV e+/e-</p>

<p>Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a distinct class of stellar explosions, exhibiting peak luminosities 10-100 times brighter than those of normal SNe. Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and radiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new insights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.</p>
