<p>2025-08-26, <strong>Single pion-production and pion propagation in Achilles</strong>, Joshua Isaacson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19213v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.19213v1</a></p>

<p>We extend the applicability of Achilles (A CHIcagoLand Lepton Event Simulator) by incorporating the single-pion production mechanism in a fully exclusive fashion. The electroweak interaction vertex is modeled by combining the state-of-the-art Dynamical Coupled-Channels approach with realistic hole spectral functions, which account for correlations in both the initial target state and the residual spectator system. Final-state interactions are treated using a semi-classical intranuclear cascade that leverages nuclear configurations to determine the correlated spatial distribution of protons and neutrons. The meson-baryon scattering amplitudes used in the cascade are computed within the Dynamical Coupled-Channels framework, consistent with the electroweak vertex. To model pion absorption, we employ the optical potential approach of Oset and Salcedo. As an alternative approach, we explicitly model the production and propagation of resonances which mediate pion-nucleon scattering and pion absorption. We validate out approach against pion-nucleon and pion-nucleus scattering data, and present comparisons with electron- and neutrino-nucleus measurements from e4$\nu$, T2K, MINER$\nu$A, and MicroBooNE.</p>

<p>2025-08-26, <strong>SN2023syz and SN2025cbj: Two Type IIn Supernovae Associated with IceCube High-energy Neutrinos</strong>, Ming-Xuan Lu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19080v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.19080v1</a></p>

<p>Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are a subclass of core-collapse SNe in which strong interactions occur between the ejecta and dense circumstellar material, creating ideal conditions for the production of high-energy neutrinos. This makes them promising candidate sources of neutrinos. In this work, we conduct an association study between 163 SNe IIn observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility and 138 neutrino alert events detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory. After excluding alerts with poor localization, we find two SNe that are spatiotemporally coincident with neutrino events. IC231027A and IC250421A coincide with the positions of SN2023syz and SN2025cbj, respectively, within their localization uncertainties, and the neutrino arrival times are delayed by 38 days and 61 days relative to the discovery times of the corresponding SNe. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that the probability of such two coincidences occurring by chance in our sample is $p \sim 0.67\%$, suggesting a high likelihood that they arise from genuine associations, though the result is not yet statistical significant. Furthermore, model calculations show that the expected numbers of neutrino events from these SNe IIn could be consistent with the actual observations. Our study provides possible evidence that interacting SNe may be potential neutrino-emitting sources.</p>

<p>2025-08-26, <strong>Perturbative and nonperturbative aspects of neutrino oscillations in quantum field theory</strong>, Massimo Blasone et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18917v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18917v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we present a comprehensive and pedagogical review of two quantum field theoretical approaches to neutrino flavor mixing and oscillations: the non-perturbative flavor Fock space formalism and the perturbative interaction picture framework.</p>

<p>2025-08-26, <strong>Structure of leptonic Yukawa couplings in the Zee model</strong>, Chuan-Hung Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18757v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18757v1</a></p>

<p>The radiative neutrino mass matrix $m^\nu$ in the Zee model depends on leptonic Yukawa couplings $F$ to a singlet scalar and $Y^\ell$ to a new Higgs doublet. Leveraging the skew-symmetric structure of $F$, we derive a unique identity linking $F$ and $m^\nu$ that is explicitly independent of $Y^\ell$. This relation implies that five entries of $Y^\ell$ can, in principle, be determined directly from $m^\nu$ and $F$, while the remaining four can be selected based on phenomenological assumptions. As an illustration, we apply this framework to the two-zero texture $B2$, highlighting its enhancement of the muon $g-2$.</p>

<p>2025-08-26, <strong>A $Z_4$ Scotogenic Model with Higgs Portal</strong>, Noel Jonathan Jobu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18713v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18713v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a new Scotogenic type model based on a global $Z_4$ symmetry involving dark matter candidates. After the symmetry breaking as $Z_4$ to $Z_2$ via the singlet scalar vacuum expectation value (VEV), the lightest Majorana fermion works as a viable thermal freeze-out dark matter (DM) candidate, and the mass terms for active neutrinos are generated as a finite quantum correction at the 1-loop level. A key point of realising our Scotogenic structure is to introduce two types of Majorana fermions (heavy right-handed neutrinos) and inert Higgs doublets with opposite $Z_4$ parities. Since a large VEV for the singlet scalar is not so harmful in an appropriate realisation of the Higgs mechanism for the SM gauge symmetry, we can naturally realise a TeV-scale fermionic DM candidate, where constraints via direct detection experiments are less than those for sub-TeV DM. Our scenario involves the Higgs-portal DM interactions, which help the realisation of the correct DM relic abundance. Relying on the structure of the model, it is possible to find a natural partner for coannihilation. Our scenario can be investigated via the measurement of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling at the Large Hadron Collider. The simplest way to evade the domain-wall problem by adding a tiny soft $Z_2$ breaking term works, keeping a sufficient longevity of the decaying DM lifetime.</p>

<p>2025-08-26, <strong>One texture zero for Dirac neutrinos in a diagonal charged lepton basis</strong>, Richard H. Benavides et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18611v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18611v1</a></p>

<p>An analytic and numerical systematic study of the neutrino mass matrix $M_\nu$ with one texture zero in a basis where the charged leptons are diagonal, and under the assumption that neutrinos are Dirac particles, is carried through in detail. Our study is done without any approximation, first analytically and then numerically. Current neutrino oscillation data are used in our calculations. The analysis done constraints the parameter space in such a way that among the six possible one texture zero patterns, only four turn out to be favored by current neutrino oscillation data at the $3\sigma$ level. Phenomenological implications on the lepton CP violation phase and neutrino masses are explored.</p>

<p>2025-08-26, <strong>Search for the radiative decay of the cosmic neutrino background through spectral measurements of the cosmic infrared background using PRIMA</strong>, Yuji Takeuchi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18590v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18590v1</a></p>

<p>We propose to search for a faint yet distinguishable contribution to the cosmic infrared background (CIB) spectrum arising from the radiative decay of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B). In the Standard Model of particle physics, neutrino decay is highly suppressed, with a predicted lifetime on the order of $10^{43}$ years. However, non-standard models suggest the possibility of significantly shorter lifetimes, ranging from $10^{12}$ to $10^{17}$ years. Observations to date, however, only provide a lower limit of approximately $10^{12}$ years for the neutrino lifetime. In PRIMA’s low-resolution mode ($R \sim 100$), a diffuse background analysis, combined with the removal of point sources associated with known galaxies in a wide-field ($\sim 1$ square degree) spectroscopic survey covering in the 24-240 $\mu$m range could facilitate a search for neutrino decay lifetimes up to $O(10^{15})$ years. The expected signal from C$\nu$B decay at 50 $\mu$m for a neutrino lifetime of $O(10^{15})$ years is more than an order of magnitude fainter than the CIB and over three orders of magnitude fainter than the zodiacal emission foreground. Taking advantage of the characteristic spectral features of C$\nu$B decay, this level of sensitivity can be achieved with approximately 100 hours of total observation time, based on estimated surface brightness sensitivity. Searching for neutrino decay at this sensitivity could place strong constraints on several non-standard theories. A positive detection would provide compelling evidence for non-standard contributions to neutrino decay and could directly reveal the cosmic neutrino background. Furthermore, the decay photon spectrum could offer insights into the absolute mass of neutrinos, and key cosmological parameters.</p>

<p>2025-08-26, <strong>Results of the LEGEND-200 experiment in the search for neutrinoless double beta decay</strong>, Carmen Romo-Luque et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18573v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18573v1</a></p>

<p>The LEGEND experiment is looking for the extremely rare neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay of $^{76}$Ge using isotopically-enriched high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. The detection of this process would imply that the neutrino is a Majorana particle and the total lepton number would not be conserved, which could be related to the cosmological asymmetry between matter and antimatter through leptogenesis. The long-term goal of the collaboration is LEGEND-1000: a 1-ton detector array planned to run for 10 years, with a projected half-life sensitivity exceeding $10^{28}$ years, fully covering the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. A first search for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay has been carried out by LEGEND-200 building on the experience gained from GERDA and the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR. The experiment has been collecting physics data for a year at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy with 140 kg of HPGe detectors. With a total exposure of 61 kg yr, LEGEND-200 has achieved a background index of $5^{+3}_{-2}\times10^{-4}$ counts/(keV kg yr) in the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay signal region from the highest performing detectors. After combining the results from GERDA, the MAJORANA Demonstrator and LEGEND-200, an exclusion sensitivity $ &gt; 2.8\times10^{26}$ yr has been obtained at 90\% confidence level for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay half-life, with no evidence for a signal. A new observed lower limit of $T^{0\nu}_{1/2} &gt; 1.9\times10^{26}$ yr at 90\% confidence level has been established.</p>

<p>2025-08-25, <strong>Contribution of Subthreshold States to the Residual Energy Distribution of $^{159}$Dy</strong>, Tadafumi Kishimoto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18562v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18562v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the residual energy distribution in the electron capture (EC) process of $^{159}$Dy, emphasizing the role of subthreshold atomic states, which have typically been omitted in conventional spectral analyses. By incorporating these energetically forbidden hole states into the spectral function $P(E)$, we demonstrate a significant enhancement - over an order of magnitude - in the EC rate near the zero-momentum neutrino emission region. This enhancement increases further with larger $Q$ values, contrary to standard expectations. Our analysis shows that $P(E)$ can be experimentally determined, resolving ambiguities near the endpoint and enabling new approaches to ‘ultra-low $Q$ value’ EC reactions for neutrino mass studies.</p>

<p>2025-08-25, <strong>Challenges and Optimization of Mu2e Proton Target Design with Radiative Cooling</strong>, Z. Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18450v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18450v1</a></p>

<p>Mu2e, the Muon-to-Electron Conversion Experiment, aims to identify physics beyond the Standard Model, namely, the conversion of muons to electrons without the emission of neutrinos. The muons are produced from pions generated in a production target when it is hit by an 8 GeV proton beam from the Fermilab Booster/Main Injector. The proton target design space is strongly constrained by a one-year operating lifetime and the need for radiative cooling in a vacuum environment. Uncertainties in the lifetime of the existing baseline design - a monolithic, segmented tungsten target - are large, particularly due to unknown impacts of radiation damage at the very high proton fluences expected in the experiment. We have begun evaluation of a new design utilizing Inconel 718 over the WL10 used in the existing target design. As a result, the structural design of the target has evolved significantly. This evolution focuses on lowering the target temperature, minimizing obstruction to muons, increasing structural stability, maximizing fatigue lifetime, simplifying the fabrication process, and more. The thermal management, structural stability and fatigue lifetime are emphasized here. These optimizations have led to a promising new target design for the Mu2e experiment.</p>

<p>2025-08-25, <strong>Super-Accreting Active Galactic Nuclei as Neutrino Sources</strong>, Gustavo E. Romero et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18441v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18441v1</a></p>

<p>Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) often exhibit broad-line regions (BLRs), populated by high-velocity clouds in Keplerian orbits around the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) at subparsec scales. During episodes of intense super-Eddington accretion, the disk can launch a powerful radiation-driven wind that overtakes the BLR clouds, forming bowshocks. Two shocks arise: one into the wind and another into the cloud. If adiabatic, electrons and protons are efficiently accelerated via Fermi processes to relativistic energies. In dense winds, the resulting high-energy photons are absorbed and reprocessed within the photosphere, while neutrinos from inelastic $pp$ collisions escape. We explore the potential of super-accreting AGNs as neutrino sources and propose a new class of emitter: an AGN without jets or gamma-ray counterparts, but with a strong opaque disk wind. As a case study, we consider a SMBH with $M_{\rm BH}=10^6,M_{\odot}$ and accretion rates consistent with tidal disruption events (TDEs). We compute the main cooling processes for relativistic particles and show that super-Eddington SMBHs can produce detectable neutrino fluxes with only weak electromagnetic signatures. Such fluxes may be observable by IceCube-Gen2 in nearby galaxies with a high BLR cloud filling factor. For more massive black holes, detection remains possible with moderate filling factors if the source is close, or at larger distances if the filling factor is high. Our model thus provides a plausible scenario for extragalactic neutrino sources, where both flux and timescale are determined by the number of orbiting clouds and the duration of the super-accreting phase.</p>

<p>2025-08-25, <strong>Hillas meets Eddington: the case for blazars as ultra-high-energy neutrino sources</strong>, Xavier Rodrigues et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18345v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18345v1</a></p>

<p>Blazars are promising high-energy neutrino source candidates. Yet, leptohadronic models face challenges in describing neutrino emission within a viable energy budget, and their predictive power is limited by the commonly used single-zone approximation and the reliance on phenomenological parameters. In this work, we present a new leptohadronic model where a sub-Eddington jet evolves from magnetically- to kinetically dominated. A small fraction of the electrons and protons picked up by the jet are continuously accelerated to a power-law spectrum, estimated based on the local magnetic field strength, turbulence, and ambient density, for which we assume power-law profiles. The model parameters are thus directly tied to the jet physics and are comparable in number to typical single-zone models. We then numerically calculate the emission along the jet. Applying the model to the IceCube candidate TXS 0506+056, we find that protons are accelerated to EeV energies in the inner jet, producing a neutrino flux up to order 100 PeV that is consistent with the public 10 year IceCube point-source data. Proton emission at 0.1 pc describes the X-ray and gamma-ray data, while electron emission at the parsec scale describes the optical data. Protons carry a power of about 1% of the Eddington luminosity, showing that the model is energetically viable. The particle spectra follow $E^{-1.8}$, with diffusion scaling as $E^{0.3}$, ruling out Bohm-like diffusion. Additional particle injection near the broad line region can reproduce the 2017 flare associated to a high-energy neutrino. We also apply the model to blazar PKS 0605-085, which may be associated with a recent neutrino detected by KM3NeT above 100 PeV. The results suggest that blazars are efficient neutrino emitters at ultra-high energies, making them prime candidates for future experiments targeting this challenging energy range.</p>

<p>2025-08-25, <strong>Measurement of the branching ratio of $\mathrm{^{16}N}$, $\mathrm{^{15}C}$, $\mathrm{^{12}B}$, and $\mathrm{^{13}B}$ isotopes through the nuclear muon capture reaction in the Super-Kamiokande detector</strong>, Y. Maekawa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18110v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18110v1</a></p>

<p>The Super-Kamiokande detector has measured solar neutrinos for more than $25$ years. The sensitivity for solar neutrino measurement is limited by the uncertainties of energy scale and background modeling. Decays of unstable isotopes with relatively long half-lives through nuclear muon capture, such as $\mathrm{^{16}N}$, $\mathrm{^{15}C}$, $\mathrm{^{12}B}$ and $\mathrm{^{13}B}$, are detected as background events for solar neutrino observations. In this study, we developed a method to form a pair of stopping muon and decay candidate events and evaluated the production rates of such unstable isotopes. We then measured their branching ratios considering both their production rates and the estimated number of nuclear muon capture processes as $Br(\mathrm{^{16}N})=(9.0 \pm 0.1)\%$, $Br(\mathrm{^{15}C})=(0.6\pm0.1)\%$, $Br(\mathrm{^{12}B})=(0.98 \pm 0.18)\%$, $Br(\mathrm{^{13}B})=(0.14 \pm 0.12)\%$, respectively. The result for $\mathrm{^{16}N}$ has world-leading precision at present and the results for $\mathrm{^{15}C}$, $\mathrm{^{12}B}$, and $\mathrm{^{13}B}$ are the first branching ratio measurements for those isotopes.</p>

<p>2025-08-25, <strong>Searching non-standard interactions with atmospheric neutrinos at ESSnuSB</strong>, ESSnuSB et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18103v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.18103v1</a></p>

<p>Atmospheric neutrinos provide a unique avenue to study neutrino interactions in matter. In this work, the prospects of constraining non-standard neutrino interactions with atmospheric neutrino oscillations are investigated for the proposed ESSnuSB far detector. By analyzing atmospheric neutrino samples equivalent to 5.4 Mt$\cdot$year exposure, it is found that ESSnuSB could be able to set the upper bounds $|\epsilon_{e\mu}^m| &lt; 0.053, |\epsilon_{e\tau}^m| &lt; 0.057, |\epsilon_{\mu\tau}^m| &lt; 0.021, \epsilon_{ee}^m - \epsilon_{\mu\mu}^m &lt; 0.075$ and $|\epsilon_{\tau\tau}^m - \epsilon_{\mu\mu}^m| &lt; 0.031$ at $90\%$ CL, when the results are minimized for $\phi_{e\mu}^m, \phi_{e\tau}^m$ and $\phi_{\mu\tau}^m$ and normal ordering is assumed for neutrino masses. It is also shown that the presence of non-standard interactions could affect the sensitivities to neutrino mass ordering and $\theta_{23}^{}$ octant in comparison to the standard interaction scheme. The results of this work highlight the complementarity between atmospheric and accelerator neutrino programs in ESSnuSB.</p>

<p>A proposed future ultra high energy collider such as the Future Circular Collider produces intense and collimated neutrinos from weak decays of hadrons. We have estimated the production yields of such neutrinos from proton-proton collisions whose center-of-mass energy is 100~TeV and integrated luminosity of 1~ab$^{-1}$. Using a hypothetical detector positioned either 0.5~km or 2~km downstream of the proton-proton interaction point along the beamline, we have discussed the expected charged current neutrino scattering event rates and their possible extension up to the neutrino energy of about 50~TeV. We have also addressed a feasibility to observe so-far-unmeasured direct $W^{\pm}$ boson production from the interactions of neutrinos with nucleus.</p>

<p>All stars rotate. While magnetic braking slows massive stars, the effect a stellar companion has on stellar rotation is still being explored. To prepare for future observations from rotating core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), we analyze a set of 30 2D neutrino radiation-hydrodynamic CCSN simulations for a variety of compactness values, rotation rates, and equations of state. We systematically explore how rotation lowers expected neutrino counts and energies for a realistic detector, while accounting for adiabatic Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein matter effects. We quantify the effect of viewing angle for neutrino emission for multiple rotation rates. Using ‘multimessenger synthesis’, we develop a technique that correlates multimessengers to constrain the neutrino mass ordering for a future supernova event. Likewise, we develop a method to constrain the distance to a rotating or nonrotating CCSN, regardless of explosion outcome.</p>

<p>Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are compelling candidates for explaining the present-day relic abundance of cold dark matter (CDM), yet their formation typically requires finely tuned early-universe dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel PBH formation mechanism within a well-established magnetogenesis framework. This scenario simultaneously accounts for the large-scale magnetic fields observed today and generates an enhanced curvature power spectrum at intermediate scales, leading to PBH formation with masses that can survive until the present epoch. We identify a narrow reheating temperature range, $10^5\,\mathrm{GeV} \leq T_{re} \leq 3\times 10^5\,\mathrm{GeV}$, within which the resulting PBHs can constitute the entirety of the observed CDM abundance. Furthermore, our model predicts a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background as a byproduct of the PBH formation process. Remarkably, the predicted GW signal lies within the sensitivity reach of upcoming space-based interferometers, such as the LISA, DECIGO, or SKA mission, offering a direct observational probe of this PBH generation mechanism.</p>

<p>Neutral hydrogen (HI) 21-cm Intensity Mapping (IM) holds the potential to map the large-scale structures in the Universe over a wide redshift range $(z \lesssim 5.5)$, measure cosmological parameters, and shed light on the nature of dark energy. In addition, the signal is also sensitive to how the HI is distributed among the dark matter haloes, this being quantified through the HIHM relation, which relates the HI mass to the halo mass. In this work, we investigate whether measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum (PS) and bispectrum (BS) at large scales can be used to estimate the HIHM relation, which quantifies the HI distribution at small scales. As a proof of concept, we consider the simulated 21-cm IM signal at $z=1$. We find that the measured 21-cm PS and BS at large scales $(k \le k_{ul} = 0.32 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ are well modeled using perturbation theory, with only two free parameters namely $[\Omega_{\rm HI} b_1]$ and $\gamma = b_2/b_1$. Combining the measured 21-cm PS and BS with an independent measurement of $\Omega_{\rm HI} $, we show that it is possible to estimate the three parameters that quantify the HIHM relation. We expect observational estimates of the HIHM relation to shed light on galaxy formation and the evolution of the ISM. Our preliminary analysis ignores redshift space distortion and the system noise in IM observations, which we plan to address in future work.</p>

<p>The dSphs around the Milky Way are commonly considered as systems that are supported by velocity dispersion against self-gravitation. They have been long accounted among the best targets to search for indirect DM signatures in the GeV-to-TeV gamma-rays due to absence of astrophysical gamma-ray foreground or background emission. We present forecasts on the sensitivity of the future CTAO for the search for annihilating or decaying DM in such targets. We perform an original selection of candidates out of the current catalog of known objects, including both classical and ultra-faint targets. For each of them, we calculate the expected amount of DM using the most updated and complete available samples of photometric and spectroscopic data of member stars, adopting a common framework of data treatment for both classes of objects. In this way, we are able to generate novel astrophysical factor profiles for general indirect DM searches that we compare with the current literature. Out of a starting sample of 64 dSphs, we highlight the 8 most promising targets - DraI, CBe, UMaII, UMi and Wil1 in the Northern hemisphere; RetII, Scl and SgrII in the Southern hemisphere - for which different DM density models (either cored or cuspy) lead to similar expectations, at variance with what happens for other DM targets - thus resulting in more robust predictions. We find that CTAO will provide the strongest limits above ~10 TeV, down to values of velocity-averaged annihilation cross section of ~5$ \times 10^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and up to decay lifetimes of ~10$^{26}$ s for combined limits on the best targets. We argue that the largest source of inaccuracy is due to the still imprecise determination of the DM content, especially for ultra-faint dSphs. We propose possible strategies of observation for CTAO, either optimized on a deep focus on the best known candidates, or on the diversification of targets.</p>

<p>The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment is searching for dark matter interactions in a liquid xenon time projection chamber (LXe-TPC). This article demonstrates how control of the flow state in the LXe-TPC enables the identification of pairs of sequential alpha-decays, which are used to map fluid flow and ion drift in the liquid target. The resulting transport model is used to tag $^{214}$Pb beta-decays, a leading background to dark matter signals in LZ. Temporally evolving volume selections, at a cost of 9.0% of exposure, target the decay of each $^{214}$Pb atom up to 81 minutes after production, resulting in (63 $\pm$ 6$_{\mathrm{stat}}$ $\pm$ 7$_{\mathrm{sys}}$)% identification of $^{214}$Pb decays to ground state. We also demonstrate how flow-based tagging techniques enable a novel calibration side band that is concurrent with science data.</p>

<p>In interacting dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) scenarios, the interaction function typically includes a coupling parameter $\xi$ that quantifies the strength of energy exchange between the dark sectors. While $\xi$ is often assumed to be constant, there is no fundamental reason to exclude a time-dependent coupling, which could provide a more general and realistic description of dark sector dynamics. In this work, we study two widely used interacting models involving pressureless DM and DE, where the coupling parameter is allowed to vary with the scale factor $a$. Specifically, we consider two parametrizations: $\xi(a) = \xi_0 + \xi_a (1-a)$ and $\xi(a) = \xi_0 \left(1 + \frac{1-a}{a^2 + (1-a)^2} \right)$, and constrain them using the latest cosmological observations, including Planck 2018 CMB data, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and multiple Type Ia supernovae samples. Our results show that one scenario yields evidence for a non-zero interaction at more than 95\% confidence level, while the remaining cases indicate at most mild or inconclusive signs of interaction. These findings highlight the potential of variable coupling models and the importance of continued investigation into the nature of the dark sectors.</p>

<p>Motivated by recent results from the DESI collaboration, we explore two classes of quintessence models that can give rise to crossing of the dark energy equation of state through the ``phantom divide’’ $w=-1$. These are models with Lagrangians that involve higher powers of the kinetic energy $\dot\phi^2$, or where the dark matter (DM) mass is a function of $\phi$. Both have similar features with respect to the reconstructed redshift-dependent $w(z)$: moderate tuning of parameters is required to achieve the desired shape, and it is difficult or impossible for $w(z)$ to continue evolving smoothly as $z$ becomes large. Nevertheless, they give a strong improvement over $\Lambda$CDM in fitting the data. We point out that models of coupled dark matter and dark energy that cross the phantom divide are under pressure from constraints on long-range DM forces. They rule out the simplest renormalizable coupling of scalar DM to quintessence, but leave the fermionic case marginally allowed, while exponentially coupled models are safe from current constraints.</p>

<p>Are the most massive objects in the Universe today the direct descendants of the most massive objects at higher redshift? We address this question by tracing the evolutionary histories of haloes in the MultiDark Planck2 simulation. By following the 100 most massive halos at $z = 0$ across cosmic time, we find that only 40\% of them were among the largest 100 halos at $z = 1$. This suggests that many of today’s most massive clusters were not the most dominant structures at earlier times, while some of the most massive objects at high redshift do not remain in the top mass ranks at later epochs. The hierarchical nature of structure formation predicts that, on average, massive haloes grow over time, with their abundance in comoving space decreasing rapidly at higher redshifts. However, individual clusters exhibit diverse evolutionary paths: some undergo early rapid growth, while others experience steady accretion or significant merger-driven mass changes. A key assumption in self-similar models of cluster evolution is that the most massive objects maintain their rank in the mass hierarchy across cosmic time. In this work, we test this assumption by constructing a mass-complete sample of haloes within the $(1 h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ volume of MultiDark and analysing when clusters enter and exit a high-mass-selected sample. Our results demonstrate that cluster selections must be carefully constructed, as significant numbers of objects can enter and leave the sample over time. These findings have important implications for observational cluster selection and comparisons between simulations and surveys, especially at high redshift.</p>

<p>If dark matter (DM) exists in halos around rotating neutron stars (NSs), it will be essential to understand the effects of rotation on the distribution of DM and baryonic matter (BM) in the stars to interpret observations. In this work, we construct rapidly rotating dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) with DM halos using the two-fluid approximation, where the BM and DM interact only through gravity. Our goal is to describe rapidly rotating millisecond-period DANS spun up by the accretion of BM from a zero angular momentum state. We extend the Rapidly Rotating Neutron Star (RNS) code to compute axisymmetric configurations in which the BM rotates rigidly while the DM remains torque-free and differentially rotates through the frame-dragging of spacetime. For the first time, we examine in detail local and global definitions of mass in general relativity for two-fluid systems, showing how their differences affect the interpretation of baryonic and dark component masses. We compute energy density and frame-dragging frequency profiles for DANS with three different characteristic DM halos. We demonstrate that rapid BM rotation reduces DM halo sizes if central energy densities are kept constant between non-rotating and rotating models. We also construct sequences of DANS to create mass and radius curves and compare rotating and non-rotating cases. Finally, we quantify deviations in the spacetime metric outside the baryonic surfaces of these sequences of stars caused by the DM halos. We hypothesize that the size of this quantity could indicate whether a DM halo will significantly impact X-ray pulse profile modeling. These results provide a framework for assessing the observational consequences of DM halos around rapidly rotating NSs.</p>

<p>We present the first unified constraints on a broad class of extended dark matter compact objects (EDCOs) from interstellar gas heating. These include axion stars, Q-balls, axion miniclusters, dark fermion stars and primordial black holes surrounded by dark matter halos, which arise in a wide range of theories beyond the Standard Model. As such massive objects traverse the interstellar medium, their gravitational influence generates wakes and, if sufficiently compact, drives accretion flows that heat gas in their vicinity. Our general framework extends standard dynamical friction treatments by incorporating finite-size effects, internal density profiles, gas penetration through objects, and criteria for accretion disk formation. We perform detailed numerical calculations of wake formation and gas heating and apply our results to the Leo T dwarf galaxy, establishing new constraints on the dark matter fraction in EDCOs heavier than a solar mass spanning several orders of magnitude in both mass and abundance.</p>

<p>Axions are hypothetical particles that provide a compelling solution to two major mysteries in modern physics: the strong CP problem and the nature of dark matter. The plasma haloscope has been proposed as a promising approach for probing the higher-mass regime for dark matter axions by employing a periodic arrangement of conducting wires. In this study, we present a novel tuning mechanism for such wire-based structures by bundling the wires into a spiral configuration. This design enables continuous frequency tuning of approximately 25% with a single central rotation while maintaining the form factor. To validate this concept, we fabricated a prototype cavity comprising six spiral arms and experimentally demonstrated its feasibility, achieving results in good agreement with numerical simulations.</p>

<p>The classic model of the Local Group (LG) is that of two dominant constituents, the Milky Way and M31, first separating and then detaching from the Hubble flow, leading to a nearly radial approaching orbit. This simple model has been confronted by new measurements of the 3D M31 kinematics, by cosmological simulations, and by theoretical understanding of the impact of massive substructures such as the Large Magellanic Cloud. This article explores the consequences of new observations and theory on the determination of the mass and dynamics of the LG. The M31 tangential velocity measurement and contribution from the cosmological constant both increase the implied timing mass of the LG to be $\sim 5 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$. Timing mass estimates for the LG tend to be larger than the sum of the Milky Way and M31 halo masses, and larger than independent LG mass estimators. Precision future kinematics have the potential to explore the origin of this difference, shed light on dark matter in the LG, the origin of its angular momentum, and possibly even local values of cosmological parameters.</p>

<p>We present a comprehensive study of the optical and dynamical properties of a rotating black hole immersed in a Dehnen-type $(1,4,0)$ galactic dark matter halo, modeled by a double power-law density profile commonly used to describe realistic galactic cores. By extending our previous Schwarzschild-Dehnen solution using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm, we construct a Kerr-like axisymmetric spacetime that smoothly incorporates both black hole rotation and the influence of the surrounding dark matter halo. We systematically investigate the effects of the halo parameters-the central density and halo radius-on horizon structure, the shape and extent of the ergoregion, and the null geodesics associated with black hole shadows. Our results show that the presence of a dense or extended halo expands the event horizon and ergoregion, and significantly alters the size and distortion of the black hole shadow. Furthermore, by applying the WKB approximation to scalar field perturbations, we compute the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra and demonstrate that the frequencies and damping times of ringdown signals are highly sensitive to the halo profile. These results open promising avenues for probing the dark matter environment of astrophysical black holes through black hole imaging and gravitational wave observations.</p>

<p>The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, despite its success, is challenged by persistent observational tensions in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($S_8$), motivating the exploration of alternative cosmological scenarios. We investigate a dark energy model with a phenomenological interaction in the dark sector, constructed to be exactly degenerate at the background level with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. This setup allows us to test whether models with identical expansion histories but distinct physical mechanisms can be distinguished by cosmological data. We perform a Bayesian analysis using a combination of recent datasets: DESI DR2 BAO measurements, DESY5 supernovae, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that both the interacting model and the CPL model provide significantly better fits to the data than $\Lambda$CDM. Although indistinguishable in background observables, the interacting model predicts a distinct matter-sector evolution driven by a late-time sign change in the dark sector interaction at $z \approx 0.8$, corresponding to the $w=-1$ crossing in the CPL description. In this sense, the interacting picture may be considered more physical, since it avoids the problematic crossing by construction. The resulting decay of dark energy into dark matter lowers $S_8$, potentially alleviating the weak-lensing $S_8$ tension. At the same time, it predicts a sharp suppression of the growth rate $f\sigma_8(z)$ at $z \lesssim 0.8$, which is in tension with current measurements of structure formation. This indicates that the model may not simultaneously reconcile the expansion history and the observed growth of cosmic structure, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive analysis to fully assess its viability.</p>

<p>We analyze binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the latest Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) using a flexible, non-parametric framework to infer the underlying black hole mass distribution. Our model employs Gaussian Processes (GPs) with astrophysically motivated priors to represent the mass distribution, assuming both component masses are independently drawn from a common mass function. This approach enables us to capture complex features in the population without relying on rigid parametric forms. Motivated by predictions from binary stellar evolution, we focus on the presence of a mass gap in the range $40-120~ M_\odot$, attributed to the pair-instability supernova (PISN) and pulsational PISN (PPISN) processes. Using our GP-based model, we find for the first time, strong evidence for the onset of this mass gap, locating its lower edge at approximately $45-60 ~M_\odot$. We observe a suppression in the BBH merger rate when comparing the latest constraints against our GP model, by a factor of $10-60$ at $\sim60~M_\odot$, corresponding to the minimum of the mass gap. Additionally, we find evidence of a subpopulation of mergers populating the mass gap around $70 ~M_\odot$, which we argue is due to hierarchical mergers, as well as of a feature in the $40-50~ M_\odot$ range, albeit with low significance, which we attribute to the predicted PPISN build up. We discuss the astrophysical implications of this result in light of GW231123, a recently reported BBH merger with a total mass potentially above the PISN gap, suggesting the need for revised models of massive stellar evolution or alternative formation channels.</p>

<p>We report the discovery of diffuse radio emission within SNR G338.3-0.0 using new MeerKAT observations at 816 MHz and 1.4 GHz. The radio emission spatially overlaps with the X-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by PSR J1640-4631 and the GeV/TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1640-465. The morphology of this radio emission is centrally peaked and its extent is well-contained within the SNR shell. A lack of mid- and far-infrared counterparts and the absence of catalogued H II regions argues against a thermal origin, while the morphology and radial profile are suggestive of a PWN origin powered by PSR J1640-4631. Under this assumption, we use a one-zone, time dependant model to reproduce the size and broadband (radio, X-ray, and gamma-rays) spectral energy distribution of the PWN. The modelling and broadband properties of this PWN suggests it is currently interacting with the reverse shock within its host SNR. This evolutionary stage is associated with particles escaping the PWN and entering the ISM, suggesting this object may be an important source of Galactic PeV e+/e-</p>

<p>Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a distinct class of stellar explosions, exhibiting peak luminosities 10-100 times brighter than those of normal SNe. Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and radiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new insights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.</p>

<p>Core-collapse supernovae provide a unique opportunity to probe axions because they can be a copious source of the particles. It has recently been proposed that axion helioscopes can be used for the direct search for supernova axions if a supernova event appears within a few hundred parsecs. However, the event number of supernova axions has been estimated only within the post-process framework. In this study, we perform long-term supernova simulations for a 9.6M_sun star coupled with the axion emission to reevaluate the event number of axions detected by the helioscopes. We find that the additional cooling induced by the axion emission can significantly decrease the temperature in the proto-neutron star. As a result, the axion luminosity and hence the axion event number are reduced, compared with the result obtained through post-processing. Our result indicates that the nonlinear feedback of the axion emission is an essential factor to predict the axion detectability, and underscores the need for systematic simulation studies across various progenitor models.</p>

<p>The interstellar dust grains are swept up during the expansion of the supernova (SN) remnant, they penetrate behind the shock front, where they are heated and destroyed in the hot gas. This leads to a change in emissivity of such grains. In this work, we consider the evolution of the infrared (IR) luminosity of the SN remnant expanding into an inhomogeneous interstellar medium with lognormal distribution of the density fluctuations. The IR luminosity of the swept-up interstellar dust rapidly increases during the first several thousand years after the SN explosion, and reaches the maximum value. Afterwards, it decreases due to the destruction of the dust grains in hot gas and their declining emissivity in the cooling down gas of the shell. We show how the IR luminosity of dust in the SN remnant depends on the dispersion of the gas density in front of the SN shock front. We find that for the significant period of time (40 - 50 kyr) the maximum of the dust IR luminosity peaks at the range centered at 70$\mu$m. Therefore, this band can be considered as the most optimal range for studying the late SN remnants. We illustrate that during evolution, the dust temperature changes from 70 to 20 K, and only slightly depends on the inhomogeneity of the medium. In the radiative phase, the strong emission lines of metal ions emerge above the dust continuum. Their luminosity rapidly increases and exceeds the dust continuum luminosity by $\sim 10-10^3$ times. The point in time when the high luminosity in the lines is reached strongly depends on the inhomogeneity of the medium. We discuss possibilities for detection of the IR emission both in dust continuum and in lines. We expect that their ratios will allow to estimate the inhomogeneity of the medium, where the remnant is expanding.</p>

<p>The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, despite its success, is challenged by persistent observational tensions in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($S_8$), motivating the exploration of alternative cosmological scenarios. We investigate a dark energy model with a phenomenological interaction in the dark sector, constructed to be exactly degenerate at the background level with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. This setup allows us to test whether models with identical expansion histories but distinct physical mechanisms can be distinguished by cosmological data. We perform a Bayesian analysis using a combination of recent datasets: DESI DR2 BAO measurements, DESY5 supernovae, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that both the interacting model and the CPL model provide significantly better fits to the data than $\Lambda$CDM. Although indistinguishable in background observables, the interacting model predicts a distinct matter-sector evolution driven by a late-time sign change in the dark sector interaction at $z \approx 0.8$, corresponding to the $w=-1$ crossing in the CPL description. In this sense, the interacting picture may be considered more physical, since it avoids the problematic crossing by construction. The resulting decay of dark energy into dark matter lowers $S_8$, potentially alleviating the weak-lensing $S_8$ tension. At the same time, it predicts a sharp suppression of the growth rate $f\sigma_8(z)$ at $z \lesssim 0.8$, which is in tension with current measurements of structure formation. This indicates that the model may not simultaneously reconcile the expansion history and the observed growth of cosmic structure, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive analysis to fully assess its viability.</p>

<p>2025-08-25, <strong>The Impact of Axion-Like Particles on Late Stellar Evolution From Intermediate-Mass Stars to core-collapse Supernova Progenitors</strong>, Inmacolata Domínguez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17779v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.17779v1</a></p>

<p>Context. Stars with masses ranging from 3 to 11 M_\odot exhibit multiple evolutionary paths. Less massive stars in this range conclude their evolution as carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs. However, those that achieve carbon ignition before the pressure by degenerate electron halts the core contraction may either form massive CONe/ONe white dwarfs, or undergo an electron-capture supernova, or photo-disintegrate neon and proceed with further thermonuclear burning, ultimately leading to the formation of a gravitationally unstable iron core. Aims. An evaluation of the impact of the energy loss caused by the production of axion-like-particles (ALPs) on evolution and final destiny of these stars is the main objective of this paper. Methods. We compute various sets of stellar models, all with solar initial composition, varying the strengths of the ALP coupling with photons and electrons. Results. As a consequence of an ALP thermal production, the critical masses for off-center C and Ne ignitions are both shifted upward. When the current bounds for the ALP coupling strengths are assumed, the maximum mass for CO WD progenitors is about 1.1 M_\odot heavier than that obtained without the ALP energy loss, while the minimum mass for a core collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitor is 0.7 M_\odot higher. Conclusions. Current constraints from observed Type II-P supernova light curves and pre-explosive luminosity do not exclude an ALP production within the current bounds. However, the maximum age of CCSN progenitors, as deduced from the star formation rate of the parent stellar population, would require a smaller minimum mass. This discrepancy can be explained by assuming a moderate extra mixing (as due to core overshooting or rotational induced mixing) above the fully convective core that develops during the main sequence.</p>

<p>2025-08-25, <strong>The Near-Infrared Echo from SN 2023xgo: Evidence for a Massive Pre-Supernova Eruption in a Type Ibn/Icn Supernova</strong>, Masayuki Yamanaka et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17582v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.17582v1</a></p>

<p>We present near-infrared (NIR) and optical observations and analysis of the Type Ibn/Icn supernova (SN) 2023xgo, spanning the period from two days to 100 days past explosion. A comparison of the NIR light curves and color evolution with those of other Type Ibn SNe reveals prominent NIR excess persisting from 15 to 100 days. The spectral energy distribution (SED) is well explained by a combination of a hot blackbody component and a carbon dust model. The dust temperature remained relatively constant at $T=1600\pm100$ K up to $t=60$ d. The estimated dust mass is $\sim1.2 \times10^{-4}~M_{\odot}$. Based on the SN emission of $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak luminosity, the evaporation radius is estimated to be $1.2\times10^{16}$ cm, consistent with the expectation from light travel time. The dust shell is located outside the shocked cool dense shell (CDS) at the position of $7.6\times10^{14}$ cm. It suggests that the observed NIR excess originates from pre-existing circumstellar (CS) dust. Considering a typical dust-to-gas mass ratio, the CS gas mass is estimated to be $\simeq10^{-2}~M_{\odot}$, implying a high mass-loss rate of $\sim0.1~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ from either a low-mass helium star progenitor with a binary interaction, or may be a massive Wolf-Rayet star that experienced a significant eruption.</p>
