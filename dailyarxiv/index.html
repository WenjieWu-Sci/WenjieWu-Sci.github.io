<p>2025-12-16, <strong>Cosmic Strings Gravitational Wave Probe of Leptogenesis: Thermal, Non-thermal, Near-resonant and Flavourful</strong>, Anish Goshal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14684v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.14684v1</a></p>

<p>Breaking a global or local $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ symmetry at high scales simultaneously generates Majorana masses for heavy right-handed neutrinos and produces a network of cosmic strings. The evolution and decay of these strings source a stochastic gravitational-wave background that may be probed by current and future gravitational-wave experiments, while the decays of the resulting massive right-handed neutrinos can generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. We derive analytical bounds for successful leptogenesis with a global and a local $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, separately finding an absolute lower bound on the lightest right-handed neutrino mass $M_1 &gt; 1.74 \times 10^{8}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ for thermal initial conditions and $M_1 &gt; \mathcal{O}(10^{6})\,\mathrm{GeV}$ for non-thermal initial conditions. Allowing for near-resonant leptogenesis relaxes these bounds to TeV scale in both cases making it a viable target at collider searches complementing the GW signals. Full flavour effects are included, and crucially, we determine the region where successful leptogenesis can be probed through gravitational-wave observations in upcoming experiments such as LISA and Einstein Telescope. Importantly, we find that flavour effects rescue regions of the parameter space that are ruled out due to current CMB or gravitational wave measurements.</p>

<p>2025-12-16, <strong>Search for heavy neutral leptons in B-meson decays</strong>, LHCb collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14551v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.14551v1</a></p>

<p>A search for long-lived heavy neutral leptons produced in B-meson decays and decaying to a $ μ^\pm π^\mp$ final state is performed with data collected by the LHCb experiment in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $5\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The results are interpreted in both lepton-number-conserving and lepton-number-violating scenarios. No significant excess is observed. Constraints are placed on the squared mixing element $|U_{μN}|^2$ to the active muon neutrino, under the assumption that couplings to other lepton flavours are negligible, in the mass range of $1.6$-$5.5$ GeV.</p>

<p>2025-12-16, <strong>Multi-messenger and time-domain astronomy in the 2040s</strong>, Samaya Nissanke et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14546v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.14546v1</a></p>

<p>Multi-messenger astronomy will be transformed in the 2040s by an unprecedented volume of detections from next-generation gravitational wave, high-energy, and ultra-high energy neutrino, cosmic ray, and time domain observatories. This white paper, prepared for the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Expanding Horizons call, outlines the key science questions enabled by this emerging multi-messenger ecosystem, ranging from nucleosynthesis and dense matter physics to cosmology, fundamental physics, and the growth of black holes across cosmic time. We demonstrate that fully exploiting these discoveries requires a step change in optical to near infrared spectroscopic capability, including low latency response, high throughput, and flexible time domain operations across both hemispheres. We argue that without a dedicated large-aperture time domain facility, the scientific return of multi-messenger astronomy in the 2040s will be considerably limited.</p>

<p>2025-12-16, <strong>Design and Evaluation of a PMT High-Voltage system for Deepsea Neutrino Telescope</strong>, Zhu Mao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14382v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.14382v1</a></p>

<p>We present the design and characterization of a Cockcroft-Walton (CW) high-voltage system developed for deep-sea neutrino telescopes. The system provides independently adjustable bias voltages to 31 three-inch PMTs inside a hybrid Digital Optical Module (hDOM). This paper describes the system design, control logic, test procedures, and the combined PMT-base performance, including baseline stability, gain uniformity, and timing accuracy. Performance was evaluated under laboratory conditions that simulate the deep-sea environment. Baseline measurements indicate low and stable electronic noise, while gain calibration using single-photoelectron spectra shows that all PMTs can be tuned to a common nominal gain and remain stable over multi-day operation. Transit-time-spread measurements yield values below 1.8 ns (FWHM), consistent with manufacturer specifications. These results demonstrate that the CW-based system delivers the stability and timing precision required for deep-sea</p>

<p>2025-12-16, <strong>Cosmological Bounds on Scotogenic Model with Asymmetric Mediator</strong>, Kento Asai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14271v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.14271v1</a></p>

<p>We study cosmological constraints on the asymmetric mediator scenario, a variant of the scotogenic model that addresses the origins of neutrino masses, dark matter (DM), and the baryon asymmetry. An SU(2)$_L$ doublet scalar $η$ mediates between the visible and dark sectors, while a singlet scalar $σ$ serves as the DM candidate. We evaluate the DM relic abundance by solving the Boltzmann equations including $η$ decay and scattering processes prior to the freeze-out of the $η$ asymmetry, and show Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraints from late-time $η$ decays. Combining the DM abundance and BBN bounds, we find the favored parameter space of this model, for instance, the mediator masses of $m_η\lesssim \mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV.</p>

<p>2025-12-16, <strong>The Nucleon Axial Form Factor from Elementary Target Data</strong>, A. S. Meyer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14097v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.14097v1</a></p>

<p>Precise neutrino-nucleon amplitudes are essential ingredients for predicting neutrino event rates in current and upcoming long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. A common neutrino interaction with a low reaction threshold and with most of the energy carried by two final state particles is quasielastic scattering, for which the nucleon axial form factor, $F_{A}(Q^{2})$, is a dominant source of uncertainty. Improvements to the nucleon axial form factor rely on neutrino scattering data with elementary targets to reduce or eliminate the need for nuclear modeling systematics. This work examines constraints on the nucleon axial form factor that can be achieved from datasets of neutrino scattering on deuterium targets, Lattice QCD predictions, and from the recent hydrogen target data from the MINERvA Collaboration. Significant tension is found between hydrogen and deuterium target data, suggesting that extractions from deuterium underestimate both the central value and uncertainty of the form factor. Parameterizations for and uncertainties of the nucleon axial form factor using the $z$ expansion are provided.</p>

<p>2025-12-16, <strong>Liquid Handling of the JUNO Experiment</strong>, Jiajun Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14033v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.14033v1</a></p>

<p>The Filling, Overflow, and Circulation (FOC) system is a critical subsystem of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), responsible for the safe handling of the Liquid Scintillator (LS) and water throughout the detector’s commissioning and operational lifetime. This paper details the design and operation of the FOC system, which accomplished the filling of the world’s largest LS detector–taking 45 days for water (6.4<em>10^4 m^3) and 200 days for LS (2.3</em>10^4 m^3). Throughout water filling, the liquid level difference between the Central Detector and Water Pool was rigorously maintained within safety limits. During LS filling, level control achieved +/-2 cm precision with flow regulation within +/-0.5% of setpoints. An automated control system based on Programmable Logic Controllers and the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System framework ensured reliable operation. The system preserved LS radiopurity, maintaining 222Rn below 1 mBq/m^3 during filling and achieving 238U/232Th concentrations below 10^-16 g/g. The successful commissioning and operation of the FOC system have established it as an indispensable foundation for the stable long-term operation of the JUNO detector.</p>

<p>2025-12-15, <strong>A Cosmic Higgs Collider</strong>, Bibhushan Shakya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13815v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.13815v1</a></p>

<p>This paper examines frameworks and phenomenology of ultrarelativistic Higgs vacuum bubble collisions in a first-order phase transition associated with the Standard Model Higgs field in the early Universe. Such collisions act as a cosmic scale Higgs collider, providing access to energy scales far beyond any temperature reached in our cosmic history, potentially up to the Planck scale. This provides a unique opportunity to probe new physics that couples to the Higgs at very high scales, while also enabling novel applications for various cosmological phenomena, opening tremendous opportunities for particle physics and cosmology. As examples, we demonstrate the viability of nonthermal production of ultra-heavy Higgs portal dark matter up to $10^{16}$ GeV (with observable indirect and direct detection signals up to $m_\text{DM}=O(10)$ TeV), and leptogenesis from the production of GUT scale right-handed neutrinos.</p>

<p>2025-12-15, <strong>Neutrino Constraints on Scalar-Tensor Gravity</strong>, Arturo de Giorgi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13798v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.13798v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we derive novel constraints on scalar-tensor theories from neutrino physics. Spatial variations of the background scalar field effectively generate density and position-dependent Standard Model masses, including neutrinos. Neutrinos are a unicum in the SM due to their ability both to propagate over galactic distances and to traverse dense media such as Earth. This makes them an ideal probe of the background scalar field, which can in turn alter flavour oscillations and supernova time delays. As we enter the era of precision neutrino physics, we are compelled to explore such a scenario. We derive expressions for the relevant observables and obtain new bounds on a broad class of scalar-tensor models. We finally map the bounds to popular screening mechanisms models, such as the Symmetron and Chameleon.</p>

<p>2025-12-15, <strong>Sub-GeV Dark Matter Detection with Dark Rates in Liquid Scintillators</strong>, Lillian Santos-Olmsted et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13779v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.13779v1</a></p>

<p>It was recently shown that standard sub-GeV dark matter candidates can be effectively probed by large neutrino observatories via annual modulation of the total photomultiplier hit rate. That work focused on the production of light by the excitation of scintillator molecules and considered the JUNO detector, surpassing limits from dedicated dark-matter detectors and reaching theoretical targets. Here, we significantly generalize that work, now also taking into account ionization channels and extending the analysis to other liquid-scintillator detectors, including SNO+, Daya Bay, Borexino, and KamLAND. Last, we present a call to action: with multiple detectors achieving competitive sensitivity, there is an opportunity to validate this new technique across experiments and to refine it using each detector’s strengths.</p>

<p>2025-12-15, <strong>Neutrino texture-zeros after JUNO’s first results: Implications for long baseline neutrino experiments</strong>, Debasish Borah et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13587v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.13587v1</a></p>

<p>The recent results from the JUNO reactor neutrino experiment have significantly improved our knowledge of the solar mixing angle $θ_{12}$ and the solar mass splitting $Δm^2_{21}$. We study the impact of these improved estimates on the validity of texture-zeros in the light neutrino mass matrix by assuming neutrinos to be of Majorana nature. Considering a diagonal charged lepton basis, we revisit the previously allowed one-zero and two-zero textures and check their validity by using updated neutrino data from JUNO. While JUNO data rule out one previously allowed two-zero texture, they also make predictions for other neutrino parameters more precise. We finally study the prospects of probing the currently allowed texture-zeros and their predicted correlations among neutrino parameters at future long baseline neutrino experiments like the DUNE. The inclusion of JUNO and reactor experiments strengthens DUNE’s ability to constrain the allowed parameter space of both one-zero and two-zero textures.</p>

<p>2025-12-15, <strong>Leptonic and Hadronic Models of High-energy Nebula Around V4641 Sgr</strong>, Maksim Kleimenov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13578v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.13578v1</a></p>

<p>A prominent, 200-pc-scale high-energy nebula surrounding the microquasar V4641~Sgr is the brightest known gamma-ray source in the Southern sky at $E &gt; 100\,\mathrm{TeV}$. In this paper, we develop self-consistent leptonic, hadronic, and leptohadronic models that reproduce both the observed spectrum and morphology of the source. Purely leptonic models are energetically more favorable yet they require rather specific morphological assumptions. The gamma-ray morphology of the source can be better explained within a hadronic scenario based on the identification of cold gas structures spatially correlated with the observed gamma-ray emission. However, a purely hadronic model for the source emission requires a substantial energy reservoir in protons and fails to reproduce the extended X-ray emission recently detected by XRISM. We show that emission including a combination of leptonic and hadronic components can reproduce both the spectral and morphological properties of the source. We provide predictions for the X-ray and neutrino spectra of~the~nebula that can discriminate the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the overall source signal.</p>

<p>2025-12-15, <strong>Testable Inverse Seesaw Motivated from a High Quality QCD Axion</strong>, Yannis Georis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13158v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.13158v1</a></p>

<p>The QCD axion remains one of the most compelling solutions to the strong CP problem. Meanwhile, the type-I seesaw mechanism offers an elegant explanation for the lightness of the observed neutrino masses; however, its extremely heavy Majorana states place it far beyond experimental reach. Low-scale alternatives such as the inverse seesaw improve testability but typically lack a strong theoretical motivation. In this paper we bridge this gap by showing that gauging the discrete symmetry $\mathbb Z_4 \times \mathbb Z_3$-motivated by the internal structure of the Standard Model-naturally yields a QCD axion with a high-quality Peccei-Quinn symmetry solving the strong CP problem, while simultaneously enforcing the field content and hierarchy required for a natural inverse seesaw. The resulting model is highly predictive and has the potential to be fully tested by future experiments. Beyond addressing the strong CP problem and the origin of neutrino masses, our scenario also contains a viable dark-matter candidate and offers potential mechanisms for generating the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</p>

<p>2025-12-16, <strong>Clustering with Light (but Massive) Relics</strong>, Jason Kumar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14672v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.14672v1</a></p>

<p>We consider the effect of Light (but Massive) Relics (LiMRs) on the clustering of matter in the early Universe. We account for the fact that LiMRs which are massive enough may cluster on large length scales at early times, and may thus impact weak lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) even on small angular scales. In particular, we find that LiMRs in the $\gtrsim$ eV mass range (and even $&gt; 10$ eV), can constitute a non-negligible component of dark matter. This opens up a class of scenarios in which energy is injected as dark radiation, but begins to redshift as matter before recombination, thus avoiding constraints on $ΔN_{eff}$ while providing an eV-range dark matter component.</p>

<p>2025-12-16, <strong>Cluster properties as a function of dynamical state in the DESI Legacy x UNIONS surveys</strong>, Syeda Lammim Ahad et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14636v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.14636v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate how the dynamical state of galaxy clusters influences their galaxy populations and mass distributions. Using photometrically selected clusters from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey cross-matched with the UNIONS galaxy shear catalogue, we classify clusters as evolved or evolving based on their rest-frame r-band magnitude gaps and stellar mass ratios between the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and bright satellites. We measure the stellar mass functions, weak-lensing profiles, and radial number density and red-fraction profiles of stacked clusters in both subsamples. Evolved clusters exhibit more concentrated lensing profiles, bimodal stellar mass functions dominated by massive BCGs, and a deficit of intermediate-mass satellites, while evolving clusters show flatter central lensing signals and an excess of massive satellites. Applying the same selection to IllustrisTNG clusters reproduces these trends and links the observed differences to distinct mass accretion histories. These results demonstrate the close link between cluster galaxy populations and the overall dynamical state of their underlying dark matter halo.</p>

<p>2025-12-16, <strong>Surveying Galaxy Clusters (in formation) in the Distant Universe</strong>, J. M. Pérez-Martínez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14372v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.14372v1</a></p>

<p>Present-day galaxy clusters are the largest virialized structures in the Universe, yet their early assembly remains poorly understood. At z$&gt;$2, clusters in formation span tens of Mpc and host gas-rich, dust-obscured galaxies embedded in extended, low-surface-brightness gaseous environments. Current (sub-)millimeter facilities lack the mapping speed, sensitivity, and contiguous field of view needed to trace the cold gas and dust driving rapid galaxy growth across such scales. A future large single-dish observatory with degree-scale coverage, broad spectral access, and high-multiplex capability would enable comprehensive and uniform mapping of entire protoclusters, revealing where star formation is triggered or quenched, and quantifying the cold gas budget, thus providing information on gas cooling within protocluster environments. In synergy with wide-sky optical/NIR surveys such as Euclid, LSST, and Roman, this facility would provide the missing multi-scale and multiphase submillimeter view needed to uncover how the stellar, gaseous, and dark-matter components assemble in protoclusters, completing our view of early structure formation.</p>

<p>2025-12-16, <strong>Connecting galaxies with their haloes – from parsec to Mpc scales</strong>, K. Fahrion et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14281v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.14281v1</a></p>

<p>Galaxy evolution is driven by processes occurring across a wide range of scales, from star formation within giant molecular clouds (parsec scales) to outflows and secular evolution across entire galaxies (kpc scales), and the interplay between galaxies, their dark matter haloes, and large-scale structures (Mpc scales). Connecting the distribution of baryonic matter and energy across these scales will remain one of the key challenges for both theoretical and observational astrophysics in the coming decade. A major development towards meeting this challenge has been the growing ability to obtain highly spatially resolved (parsec-scale) integral-field spectroscopic observations (e.g. with VLT/MUSE), as well as to probe the extremely low-surface brightness outskirts of galaxies at large radii and high vertical scale heights. To combine the two regimes, we need a paradigm shift in the way we do spectroscopy on galaxies, especially considering the ongoing and future photometric surveys. The next decade will also bring a revolution in extensive photometric surveys of large areas of the sky, uncovering low surface brightness features around nearby galaxies. However, to fully understand the processes that connect galaxies to their haloes, shape low surface brightness features, and drive secular evolution, spatially resolved spectroscopy will be essential. Here, we outline the need for wide-field spectroscopic observations of statistically significant samples of nearby galaxies and highlight the key questions that can only be addressed with such data</p>

<p>2025-12-16, <strong>Can dwarf spheroidal galaxies host a central black hole ?</strong>, K. Aditya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14146v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.14146v1</a></p>

<p>We construct mass models of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies to place constraints on the central black hole (BH) masses they can host. We model the galaxies as a three-component system consisting of the stars, dark matter halo, and a central black hole, using the Osipkov–Merritt–Cuddeford class of anisotropic distribution function. The posterior distribution of black hole mass remains flat toward the low-mass end, indicating that the kinematic data places an upper limit on the black hole mass. Our analysis yields a 95% credible upper limit of $\log(M_{\bullet}/M_{\odot}) &lt; 6$. We combine our results with black hole mass measurements and upper limits from the literature to construct a unified $M_{\bullet}$–$σ_{}$ relation spanning $σ_{} \sim 10$–$300,\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$, described by $\log(M_{\bullet}) = 8.32 + 4.08,\log\left(σ_{}/200,\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}\right)$, with an intrinsic scatter of $σ_{\rm int} = 0.55$. We compare the inferred limits to models of black hole growth via momentum-driven accretion and stellar capture, which predict black hole masses in the range $10^{3}$–$10^{4},M_{\odot}$ for the range $σ_{} \sim 6$–$12,\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$, in close agreement with the $M_{\bullet}$–$σ_{*}$ relation within the 95% credible upper limits on the black hole masses derived in this work.</p>

<p>2025-12-16, <strong>A new idea for relating the asymmetric dark matter mass scale to the proton mass</strong>, Peter Cox et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14119v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.14119v1</a></p>

<p>Asymmetric dark matter is a well-motivated approach to explain the apparent coincidence between the relic densities of visible and dark matter, $Ω_D \simeq 5.4Ω_b$. A complete explanation requires two components, a relation between the particle masses of the dark and visible matter, and a second relation between the number densities in each sector. In this work, we propose a new mechanism to address the former. We consider an extended $SU(3)_1 \times SU(3)_2$ colour group in the visible sector, with QCD embedded as the diagonal subgroup. A $\mathbb{Z}_2$ exchange symmetry then relates $SU(3)_2$ to a dark, confining $SU(3)_D$ sector. The dark matter is a composite state of dark fermions transforming in the fundamental representation of $SU(3)_D$. The spontaneously broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry ultimately leads to a relation between the QCD and dark gauge couplings which, for suitable field content, gives rise to confinement scales of the same order of magnitude. The mechanism leads to a rich particle spectrum above the TeV scale which could be probed at future experiments. The model also naturally includes an axion solution to the strong CP problem.</p>

<p>In this work, we review the history and current role of global fits in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model~(BSM), including precision tests of the Standard Model (SM). Although BSM global fits were initially focused on minimal supersymmetric models, we describe how fits have evolved in response to new data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and elsewhere, expanding to encompass a broad spectrum of BSM scenarios including non-minimal supersymmetry, axion-like particles, extended Higgs sectors, dark matter models, and effective field theories such as SMEFT. We discuss how the role of global fits has shifted from forecasting possible signals of new physics at the LHC to understanding the impact of null results from LHC run-I and II and the discovery of the Higgs boson, and how interest has shifted from global fits for parameter estimation to comprehensive model comparison. We close by discussing potential trends and future applications, emphasizing the potential for machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency of sampling algorithms and comparison between theory and experiment, as well as collaboration and software development.</p>

<p>Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of cosmology, dark matter (DM), and high-redshift galaxy evolution, but current samples of strongly lensed galaxies (SLGs) remain far too small to exploit its full potential. $\textit{Herschel}$’s submillimeter (submm) surveys demonstrated that submm selection provides the most efficient and least biased route to identifying high-redshift SLGs, yet produced only a few hundred systems over limited, heterogeneous fields. Achieving the thousands of SLGs required for precision cosmology and detailed studies of distant dusty star-forming galaxies demands a new, wide-area, homogeneous sub-mm survey. A facility like AtLAST, capable of extending $\textit{Herschel}$-like methodologies to much larger areas, is uniquely positioned to deliver the order-of-magnitude increase in SLG numbers needed for transformative progress.</p>

<p>The magnetospheres of neutron stars in the Galactic Center provide an exceptional environment to search for dark matter axions through their resonant conversion into photons. The combination of extreme magnetic fields and high dark matter density in this region creates ideal conditions for axion-photon conversion across the centimetre-to-submillimetre wavelength range. Detecting the cumulative emission from these neutron star populations demands a facility with unprecedented sensitivity, spatial resolution, and broad frequency coverage in the submillimetre domain, capabilities essential to explore a previously inaccessible region of axion parameter space.</p>

<p>Unveiling the fundamental nature of non-baryonic dark matter (DM) has profound implications for our understanding of the Universe and of the physical laws that govern it. Its manifestation as an additional source of matter necessary to explain astrophysical and cosmological observations indicates either a breakdown of General Relativity or that the current Standard Model of Particle Physics is incomplete. In the standard Cold DM (CDM) paradigm, DM consists of collisionless non-relativistic particles with negligible non-gravitational interactions. This simple hypothesis is very successful on large and intermediate scales, but faces challenges on small galactic scales. Local Group (LG) dwarf galaxies can play a fundamental role to elucidate whether these challenges stem from poorly understood fundamental baryonic processes or instead indicate that alternative DM scenarios need to be considered. In particular, a systematic determination of their DM halo properties as a function of stellar mass and star formation histories (SFH) will provide crucial observational benchmarks for models to deal with the trickiest issue that prevents us from advancing in our understanding of DM nature, i.e. the impact of baryonic processes in altering the properties of the inner regions of DM haloes. Such systematic study would require assembling accurate l.o.s. velocities (and metallicities) for several thousands of stars per galaxy, for an heterogeneous sample of target galaxies, spanning order of magnitudes in stellar mass and covering distances from about 100 kpc to more than 1 Mpc. This calls for both multi-objects spectrographs on 12m-class telescopes with fov of a few deg2 and a multiplex power in the several 1000s with the capability of providing dense sampling of the innermost regions, as well as for wide-area multi-objects spectrographs with fov of several arcmin2 on 30-40m class telescopes.</p>

<p>2025-12-15, <strong>Connection between galaxy morphology and dark-matter halo structure II: predicting disk structure from dark-matter halo properties</strong>, Jinning Liang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13822v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.13822v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate how galactic disk structures connect to the detailed properties of their host dark-matter halos using the TNG50 simulation. From the hydrodynamic and matched dark-matter-only runs, we measure a comprehensive list of halo properties describing density structure, angular momentum, shape, assembly history, and environment. Using the morphological decomposition developed in Paper I, we quantify the sizes, scale heights, and mass fractions of the disk components for galaxies at $0 \le z \le 4$. Random Forest (RF) regression shows halo properties alone predict disk size and thickness with high accuracy, while Symbolic Regression (SR) provides compact empirical relations with slightly lower accuracy. Disk height is consistently easier to predict than disk size, and lower-mass halos yield higher accuracy than massive halos. Predictions based on halo properties measured in the full-physics hydro simulations outperform those based on the matched dark-matter-only halos, reflecting the imprint of baryonic restructuring on the inner halo. SHAP analysis reveals that the most informative halo parameters include concentration, Einasto shape, global and inner spin, and recent mass accretion, though their importance varies across disk properties. We show that correlations between disk size and the density-profile shape arise primarily from disk-induced modification of the inner halo, rather than a primordial connection. Finally, we point out that disks become more extended with respect to their host halos at higher redshift in low-mass halos, while massive high-redshift halos show the opposite trend. We provide SR-based prescriptions that accurately map halo properties to disk structures, offering practical tools for galaxy-halo modeling.</p>

<p>2025-12-15, <strong>Buried but not destroyed: the evolution from prompt cusps to NFW haloes</strong>, Yuchan Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13804v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.13804v1</a></p>

<p>The internal structure of dark matter haloes encodes their assembly history and offers critical insight into the nature of dark matter and structure formation. Analytical studies and high-resolution simulations have recently predicted the formation of ‘prompt cusps’ - steep power-law density profiles that emerge rapidly from the monolithic collapse of primordial peaks. Yet, by $z=0$ most haloes are well described by Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profiles, raising the question of how these early cusps are transformed in a cosmological setting. We address this problem using 64 zoom-in $N$-body simulations of eight haloes, each resimulated with eight different free-streaming wavenumbers to control the abundance of small-scale structure while keeping the large-scale environment fixed. To mitigate numerical discreteness effects, we classify artificial fragments and genuine subhaloes with a physically motivated procedure based on matching subhaloes to their progenitor peaks. At the population level, we demonstrate that haloes initially form prompt cusps, and their profiles subsequently transition towards the NFW form. Our study reveals three distinct pathways by which prompt cusps evolve: major mergers, accretion of artificial fragments, and interactions with large-scale filaments, each having a distinct impact on the inner density profile. In particular, we show that the original power-law cusp remains visible in the profile of particles associated with the primordial peak even when the total halo profile is already NFW-like. This work highlights the imprint of early collapse on present-day halo structure and provides new insights into the origin of the universality of the NFW profile.</p>

<p>2025-12-15, <strong>Halo Lightcones with Optimised Orientation and Interpolation in Cosmological Simulations – an application to mock H$α$ selected galaxies</strong>, Sujatha Ramakrishnan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13801v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.13801v1</a></p>

<p>A critical step to create realistic mock catalogs that support large-scale photometric and spectroscopic sky surveys is the production of cosmological simulations that accurately model the survey observables taking into account the redshift-dependent galaxy formation and evolution processes. Here we develop an efficient framework, HOLCon (Halo Optimised Lightcone Constructor), for post-facto construction of dark matter halo lightcones from simulations and use them to generate a mock galaxy catalogue. HOLCon includes a module to optimise the lightcone’s orientation within the simulation box, minimising repeated structures when the survey volume exceeds a single box – a common challenge in modern surveys. A linear interpolation scheme tracks the evolution of halo properties across snapshots. Applied to the publicly available Uchuu simulation, we construct a lightcone of 50 ${\rm deg}^2$ and extending up to $z = 10$, providing representative coverage of deep fields of Stage IV surveys. We validate the lightcone for cosmological applications by comparing the dark matter halo clustering in the lightcone with those from the original simulation snapshots. Subsequently, we make the galaxy-halo connection on the lightcone with a redshift extended version of the SciPIC algorithm producing a comprehensive set of descriptive galaxy attributes. HOLCon leverages Dask, a scalable parallel computing pythonic framework for fast construction of dark matter halo lightcones enabling rapid creation of multiple statistical realizations essential for robust cosmological inference. The produced galaxy mock makes predictions for clustering of H$α$ emitters, making it a useful cosmology resource.</p>

<p>2025-12-15, <strong>Unveiling a Hidden Epoch: Impact of Mediator Induced Matter Domination in Freeze-in Dark Matter</strong>, Partha Konar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13799v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.13799v1</a></p>

<p>Freeze-in dark matter has recently garnered significant attention as a promising framework due to its feeble interactions, which are consistent with the null results from dark matter experiments. While previous studies have extensively investigated the production of dark matter through the decay of heavy particles, they overlook the cosmological role of the decaying mediator without justifying this assumption. We emphasize that the mediator can dominate the energy budget of the early universe during its decay, leading to an unavoidable early matter-dominated era. This intrinsic matter-dominated phase influences dark matter production in two key ways: (i) dark matter production occurs in both the early radiation and induced matter-dominated phases; specifically, considerable production occurs in the matter-dominated phase and stops when the mediator decays fully, and (ii) it causes dilution in dark matter abundance due to entropy injection before its saturation. Furthermore, this effect significantly alters the gravitational wave signature associated with the production of freeze-in dark matter through graviton emission during the mediator’s decay. Specifically, it enhances the gravitational wave spectrum, making it viable for future high-frequency gravitational wave experiments.</p>

<p>Recent COMPTEL data analysis reveals a $\sim$ 2 MeV continuum excess whose spatial distribution closely matches the long-standing 511 keV line observed by INTEGRAL/SPI, indicating a common population of low-energy positrons that is difficult to reconcile with known astrophysical sources or standard thermal dark matter (DM). We show that a minimal Excited Dark Matter (XDM) model naturally explains these features. In this scenario a DM particle $χ$ is inelastically upscattered into an excited state $χ^<em>$, followed by de-excitation $χ^</em>\toχe^+ e^-$ producing $\sim$2 MeV positrons that reproduce the 511 keV line morphology and the COMPTEL MeV continuum. Using a full cosmic-ray (CR) propagation treatment, we obtain an excellent fit for $m_χ\simeq$ 1.5 TeV DM particle with mass-splitting $Δm =m_{χ^*}-m_χ\simeq$ 4 MeV for an inelastic geometric scattering cross section of $σ_\textrm{mr}= 3-4\times 10^{-23}\,\textrm{cm}^2$. The same positrons supply a substantial, radially flat contribution to the anomalous Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) ionization rate. This is the first unified treatment of XDM-induced positrons across all three observables, yielding correlated MeV signatures testable by upcoming missions targeting the Galactic MeV band.</p>

<p>2025-12-15, <strong>The impact of non-Gaussianity when searching for Primordial Black Holes with LISA</strong>, Antonio Junior Iovino et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13648v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.13648v1</a></p>

<p>LISA can observe cosmological millihertz (mHz) gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds that may offer a decisive test for asteroid-mass primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter (DM). In standard scenarios, failing to detect a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background would exclude the last viable window for PBH DM formed through critical collapse. We show that this conclusion becomes much weaker in the presence of astrophysical foregrounds and strongly non-Gaussian primordial density perturbations, by studying how these phenomena affect the link between SIGWs and PBHs, and reevaluate LISA’s sensitivity to asteroid-mass PBHs. In addition, we analyse the interplay between PBHs and SIGWs to gain further insights into the nature of primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that uncertainties in $f_{\rm NL}$ can induce substantial uncertainties in the PBH abundance, which ultimately limits LISA’s capacity to fully probe the asteroid-mass PBH DM window.</p>

<p>2025-12-15, <strong>A post-inflationary kinetic axion</strong>, Enrico Morgante et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13633v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.13633v1</a></p>

<p>We present a novel realization of axion kinetic misalignment, triggered by a Hubble-induced phase transition during a post-inflationary stiff (kination) era. A negative Ricci scalar flips the sign of a non-minimally coupled mass term for a non-minimally coupled complex field $Φ$, driving its radial mode to large amplitudes via a tachyonic instability. At large $|Φ|$, higher-dimensional $U(1)$-breaking operators become relevant and impart a kick in the angular direction, generating a conserved $U(1)$ charge that sustains rotation as the symmetry is approximately restored. Because phases randomize across causally disconnected regions, multiple domains with distinct charges form. The subsequent axion potential converts the domain charges into an axion abundance, yielding dark matter even when the net global charge vanishes. We analyze the dynamics through a linear, domain-averaged treatment and identify two thermal histories: (i) Ricci reheating via saxion decays to Higgs bosons; (ii) external reheating with efficient damping of saxion energy by Higgs/fermion scatterings. The mechanism populates regions underabundant in standard misalignment, which are accessible to next generation axion searches.</p>

<p>We perform a comparative Bayesian analysis of fermionic and bosonic dark matter admixed neutron stars (DMANS) by incorporating a comprehensive set of theoretical, experimental, and astrophysical constraints. The hadronic matter equation of state (EoS) is modeled using a relativistic mean-field approach, constrained by chiral effective field theory ($χ$EFT) calculations at low densities, finite nuclei and heavy-ion collision data at intermediate densities, and neutron star (NS) observations at high densities. For the dark sector, we consider fermionic dark matter (FDM) interacting via a dark vector meson, and two bosonic dark matter models (BDM1 and BDM2) characterized by self-interacting scalar fields. Bayesian inference is employed to constrain the model parameters, including the dark matter mass, coupling strength, and dark matter fraction within NSs. Our analysis finds that all models yield consistent nuclear matter parameters, allowing a small dark matter fraction under 10%. The presence of dark matter slightly softens the EoS, leading to a modest reduction in NS mass, radius, and tidal deformability, though all models remain compatible with NICER and GW170817 observations. The log-evidence and likelihood analyses reveal no statistical preference among the FDM and BDM models, indicating that current astrophysical data cannot decisively distinguish between fermionic and bosonic dark matter scenarios. This study provides a unified statistical framework to constrain dark matter properties using NS observables.</p>

<p>We present an exploratory study of the freeze-in mechanism within a scotogenic framework, where dark matter can either be a scalar singlet or a fermion singlet. Based on a random parameter scan, we show that large portions of the parameter space feature a dark matter relic density in agreement with the limits derived by Planck. Moreover, constraints related to lepton flavour violation are mostly respected within such parameter regions. Our study shows that it will be worth to further investigate the freeze-in mechanism within scotogenic frameworks.</p>

<p>Axio-dilaton cosmology provides a minimal benchmark model for both Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) that is well motivated by fundamental physics. The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field. We find that it fits the data somewhat better than $Λ$CDM cosmology, with the $χ^2$ lowered by $\simeq 7$ for three additional parameters, and significantly raises the inferred Hubble constant to $H_0 \simeq 69.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the Hubble tension to $\lesssim 3σ$ and thereby allowing a joint fit of CMB and SH0ES data. The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\mathbf{g}|\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.</p>

<p>DarkSHINE is an electron fixed target experiment under proposal that aims to probe light dark matter in the MeV-GeV mass range via the invisible decay of dark photons, leveraging the High repetition rate 8 GeV electron beam from the Shanghai High repetition-rate XFEL and Extreme Light Facility. This proceeding presents the core detector design of the experiment, the simulation framework, and the prospects of the physics. The detector system integrates an AC-coupled Low Gain Avalanche Diode silicon tracker, a LYSO crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a scintillator-based hadronic calorimeter, all optimized for SHINE high-radiation, high-rate environment. The prototype tests at DESY and CERN have validated key performance metrics, including a spatial resolution of 6.5-8.2 microns for silicon strip sensor, an electromagnetic calorimeter energy resolution of 1.8%. Based on MC simulations and 9E14 EOT, the DarkSHINE experiment is expected to rule out most of the sensitive regions predicted by popular dark photon models.</p>

<p>A recent analysis of pulsar timing data has reported evidence for a massive ($\sim 6 \times 10^7 M_{\odot}$) dark matter subhalo located only $\sim 0.8$ kpc from Earth. This candidate implies an exceptionally large $J$-factor of $\sim 10^{23}\,{\rm GeV^2\,cm^{-5}}$, exceeding that of known classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies by orders of magnitude and rivaling the Galactic Center. In this work, we utilize more than 17 years of $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT data to search for gamma-ray emission from this subhalo. We identify a tentative excess in the region with ambiguous origin. Adopting a conservative strategy, we retain this excess without modeling additional astrophysical components, treating it instead as unmodeled background to derive upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross-section for the $b\bar{b}$ and $τ^+τ^-$ channels. Despite this conservative treatment, the resulting limits remain stringent due to the exceptionally large $J$-factor. Subject to the dynamical confirmation of the subhalo, these constraints are potentially orders of magnitude stronger than those obtained from combined analyses of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and blind subhalo searches.</p>

<p>A recent model prediction claimed that exists a correlation between the formation scenarios of globular clusters, i.e., whether they formed in situ, or in dark matter halos that were accreted into the Milky way, with some properties of their tidal tails, particularly, their widths ($w$), their dispersion in the z-component of the angular momentum ($σ\(\_{\rm L\_z}$ ), and in the line-of-sight ($σ\)_{\rm V_{LOS}}$) and tangential ($σ\(\_{\rm V\_{Tan}}$) velocities. I exploited the APOGEE DR17 data base and selected highly confident tidal tails members of 17 Milky Way globular clusters, for which the above four properties were computed for the first time. From all possible paired property combinations, I found that $σ\)_{\rm V_{LOS}}$ and $σ$$_{\rm V_{Tan}}$ resulted to be highly correlated, nearly to the identity relationship. This observation-based correlation resulted to be in an overall very good agreement with that arising from the aforementioned predictions. Additionally, when the four analyzed properties are linked to the accretion groups of the Milky way to which the globular clusters are meant to be associated, I found kinematically cold and hot tidal tails pertaining to globular clusters distributed in all the considered accretion groups. This outcome could be an evidence that globular clusters form in galaxies within a wide variety of dark matter halos, with different masses and profiles.</p>

<p>The history of dark matter is often glossed as a linear progression of accumulating evidence confirming its existence. The actual history, however, is far more complex and philosophically nuanced. In this paper, I revisit key moments in the establishment and justification of dark matter as a viable hypothesis and offer a Bayesian representation of the core inferences made at those moments. I argue, contrary to the textbook narrative, that certain evidential reclassifications played a pivotal confirmatory role even in the absence of new data. In particular, I show how unifying previously separate anomalous phenomena under a single modeling framework provided novel support for the dark matter hypothesis.</p>

<p>With large numbers of transients discovered by current and future imaging surveys, machine learning is increasingly applied to light curve and host galaxy properties to select events for follow-up. However, finding rare types of transients remains difficult due to extreme class imbalances in training sets, and extracting features from host images is complicated by the presence of bright foreground sources, particularly if the true host is faint or distant. Here we present a data augmentation pipeline for images and light curves that mitigates these issues, and apply this to improve classification of Superluminous Supernovae Type I (SLSNe-I) and Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) with our existing NEEDLE code. The method uses a Similarity Index to remove image artefacts, and a masking procedure that removes unrelated sources while preserving the transient and its host. This focuses classifier attention on the relevant pixels, and enables arbitrary rotations for class upsampling. We also fit observed multi-band light curves with a two-dimensional Gaussian Process and generate data-driven synthetic samples by resampling and redshifting these models, cross-matching with galaxy images in the same class to produce unique but realistic new examples for training. Models trained with the augmented dataset achieve substantially higher purity: for classifications with a confidence of 0.8 or higher, we achieve 75% (43%) purity and 75% (66%) completeness for SLSNe-I (TDEs).</p>

<p>Appearing as secondary higher-velocity absorption components, high-velocity features (HVFs) have been observed in several absorption lines in many Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The frequency and ubiquity of these components in silicon and calcium features specifically indicates that the mechanism through which they form must be common occurrence among the majority of SNe Ia. Here we present modelling of the HVF evolution in a sample of six well observed SNe Ia with the radiative-transfer code tardis. A base model is derived for each of the SNe to reproduce the photospheric velocity components, followed by a grid of simulations with Gaussian enhancements to the density profile at high velocities. We train a set of neural networks to emulate the impact of these density enhancements upon the simulated silicon line profile. These networks are subsequently used within a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to infer the density enhancement parameters that most closely reproduce the HVF evolution. While we obtain good matches for the silicon profile, we find that a single density enhancement alone cannot simultaneously produce the observed silicon and calcium HVF evolution. Our findings indicate that neither the delayed-detonation mechanism, nor the double-detonation mechanism can produce these HVFs, suggesting that something may be missing from the models.</p>

<p>Recent measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillations by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), especially when combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and supernova data, favor a late-time dark energy equation of state that crosses $w=-1$, which has been argued to point toward non-minimal conformal coupling in Horndeski gravity. We test this interpretation by performing a non-parametric exploration of the minimally coupled, luminal Horndeski subclass known as kinetic gravity braiding (KGB). Using mochi_class and its manifestly stable effective field theory (EFT) basis implementation, we efficiently scan a broad class of models in which the EFT functions are allowed to vary freely in time, while enforcing the absence of ghost and gradient instabilities from the outset. We identify a set of KGB models that realize phantom crossing and remain broadly consistent with current probes of the background and linear large-scale structure, including CMB temperature and lensing power spectra, redshift-space distortions, cosmic shear, and the cross-correlation between galaxies and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Our results demonstrate that viable phantom-crossing solutions exist without conformal coupling, motivating future full Bayesian analyses of this model class with non-parametric EFT priors.</p>

<p>2025-12-15, <strong>The Serendipitous Axiodilaton: A Self-Consistent Recombination-Era Solution to the Hubble Tension</strong>, Adam Smith et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13544v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.13544v1</a></p>

<p>Axio-dilaton cosmology provides a minimal benchmark model for both Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) that is well motivated by fundamental physics. The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field. We find that it fits the data somewhat better than $Λ$CDM cosmology, with the $χ^2$ lowered by $\simeq 7$ for three additional parameters, and significantly raises the inferred Hubble constant to $H_0 \simeq 69.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the Hubble tension to $\lesssim 3σ$ and thereby allowing a joint fit of CMB and SH0ES data. The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\mathbf{g}|\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.</p>
