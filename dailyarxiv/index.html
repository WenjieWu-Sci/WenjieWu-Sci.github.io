<p>2025-01-30, <strong>Reactor antineutrinos CE$ν$NS on germanium: CONUS+ and TEXONO as a new gateway to SM and BSM physics</strong>, M. Atzori Corona et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18550v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.18550v1</a></p>

<p>Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) is a key process for probing Standard Model and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) properties. Following its first detection by the COHERENT collaboration, recent reactor-based experiments provide a unique opportunity to refine our current understanding. In particular, the high-precision data from CONUS+, combined with the strong bounds from TEXONO, not only validate the CE$\nu$NS process at low energies but also provide improved constraints on the weak mixing angle, neutrino electromagnetic properties - including charge radius, millicharge, and magnetic moment - as well as non-standard interactions and light mediators. We also examine the role of elastic neutrino-electron scattering, which gains significance in certain BSM scenarios and allows us to obtain the best limit for the millicharge of the electron neutrinos. By combining reactor and higher-energy spallation neutron source measurements, this work strengthens CE$\nu$NS as a precision tool for testing the Standard Model and beyond.</p>

<p>2025-01-30, <strong>Permuted Charged Lepton Correction in the Framework of Dirac Seesaw</strong>, Sagar Tirtha Goswami et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18181v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.18181v1</a></p>

<p>A Dirac neutrino mass model is proposed, based on an extended group structure of $SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y \otimes A_4 \otimes Z_3 \otimes Z_{10}$ with the Type-I seesaw mechanism. This work explores the impact of parametrization and permutation in the charged lepton diagonalizing matrix, driven by free parameters in the charged lepton sector, on the predictions of observable parameters. Some interesting consequences on the neutrino mass hierarchies, mixing angles and the Dirac CP phase are observed. The framework also finds application in the study of charged lepton flavour violation and dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-01-30, <strong>Neutrinos in IceCube and KM3NeT</strong>, Shiqi Yu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18076v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.18076v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino observatories such as IceCube, Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope (KM3NeT), and Super-Kamiokande cover a broad energy range that enables the study of both atmospheric neutrinos and astrophysical neutrinos. IceCube and KM3NeT focus on a similar energy range, from a few GeV to PeV, and have conducted competitive work on the atmospheric neutrino flux, three-flavor oscillation parameter measurements, searches beyond the Standard Model, and investigations of cosmic-ray accelerators using high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. Recent IceCube findings of evidence of neutrino signals from NGC~1068 have triggered a series of follow-up studies. These studies provide evidence that a subset of Seyfert galaxies may produce high-energy neutrinos. The emerging candidates are NGC~4151, NGC~3079, CGCG~420-015, and Circinus Galaxy. Furthermore, a stacking analysis of 13 selected sources in the Southern Hemisphere reported a cumulative neutrino signal at 3.0\,$\sigma$, offering independent evidence that some X-ray-bright Seyfert galaxies could be potential high-energy neutrino sources. KM3NeT, still under construction, continues to accumulate data that will support future studies of astrophysical neutrino sources. However, with its currently deployed detection units, it has detected an ultra-high-energy event of several tens of PeV originating from approximately 1 degree above the horizon. This contribution highlights and summarizes recent findings from IceCube and KM3NeT in both neutrino physics and astrophysics.</p>

<p>2025-01-30, <strong>Scattering of SIMPlectic Dark Pions</strong>, Yannick Dengler et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18368v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.18368v1</a></p>

<p>We study the scattering of two identical pNGBs (pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Bosons) in Sp(4) gauge theory with two mass-degenerate Dirac fermions in the pseudo-real fundamental representation. This theory serves as a realization of a SIMP (Strongly Interacting Massive Particles) Dark Matter model. SIMPs are an exciting dark matter candidate as they make use of a new relic density mechanism and provide potential solutions to the so-called small-scale structure problems. These theories are realized by a confining dark sector which includes non-perturbative signatures. While most of the research focuses on ChPT (Chiral Perturbation Theory), first-principle verification of these models is indispensable. In these proceedings we give an update on scattering properties in the most common channel and give an outlook on the projects that lie ahead.</p>

<p>2025-01-30, <strong>A general upper bound on the light dark matter scattering rate in materials</strong>, Riccardo Catena et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18261v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.18261v1</a></p>

<p>Combining an effective theory description of spin-1/2 dark matter (DM)-electron interactions in materials with linear response theory provides a powerful framework to model the scattering of DM, including in-medium effects, in detectors used for direct searches. Within this framework, we show that the rate of DM-induced electronic transitions in detector materials admits a theoretical upper bound under general assumptions on the underlying DM-electron coupling. In particular, our theoretical upper bound applies to models where DM couples to the electron density as well as the spin, paramagnetic and Rashba currents in materials, and arises from the Kramers-Kronig relations that constrain the analytic properties of the scattering rate. We evaluate our maximum rate formula numerically for Ar, Xe, Ge, and Si targets and find that Ge and Si detectors are closer to saturate this theoretical upper bound, but still far from saturation when DM couples to densities or currents which are different from the electron density. This motivates the exploration of a different class of materials to effectively probe such coupling forms.</p>

<p>2025-01-30, <strong>On the increase in the concentration of primordial black holes in the halos of dwarf galaxies</strong>, S. V. Pilipenko et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18239v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.18239v1</a></p>

<p>Through numerical experiments, we have predicted that if dark matter (DM) contains even a small fraction, $f_0\sim10^{-4}$, of primordial black holes (PBHs), during the formation of the gravitationally bound halo of a dwarf galaxy, these PBHs will concentrate in a region with a radius of about 10 pc, so that their local fraction will exceed 1%. Unlike previous studies of PBH migration to the centers of galaxies, the numerical experiments conducted here take into account the early formation of a massive “dress” of DM around the PBHs and the non-stationarity of the halo during its formation. Applying our results to models of heating stellar clusters in the Eridanus II and Segue I galaxies due to dynamical friction between stars and PBHs allows us to impose constraints on the abundance of PBHs that are two orders of magnitude stricter than previously thought.</p>

<p>2025-01-30, <strong>Non-standard cosmological scenarios, Sommerfeld enhancement and asymmetric dark matter</strong>, Hoernisa Iminniyaz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18209v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.18209v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the relic density of asymmetric dark matter with long-range interactions in non-standard cosmological scenarios where the extra cosmic energy is introduced. The Hubble expansion rate is modified in non-standard cosmological models, which affects the relic density of dark matter. If the mass of the dark exchanged gauge boson is less than the mass of dark matter particles multiplied by the dark fine-structure constant, the wave function of the incoming particles of dark matter annihilation would be distorted away from the free plane-wave approximation, yielding the significant enhancements to annihilation cross sections, known as Sommerfeld enhancement. Sommerfeld enhancement results the asymmetric dark matter relic density under abundant, while the enhanced cosmic expansion rate increases the relic density of asymmetric dark matter by letting the decoupling from the thermal equilibrium occurs earlier. However, the mixed effect of modified cosmic expansion and the Sommerfeld enhancement on asymmetric dark matter density evolution becomes quite complicated. We investigated both effects on asymmetric dark matter freeze-out process and current relic abundance, which is significantly different from the standard situation. Further, we calculate the constraint relations of the asymmetric dark matter pertubative annihilation cross section and dark coupling constant with the mass of asymmetric dark matter, the asymmetry factor with the dark coupling constant, when the relic density of asymmetric dark matter falled in the observed region. The upper bounds on the mass of asymmetric dark matter for s-wave and p-wave annihilations are also derived.</p>

<p>2025-01-30, <strong>Spin-dependent dark matter scattering in quasi-two-dimensional magnets</strong>, Giacomo Marocco et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18120v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.18120v1</a></p>

<p>We study the prospects of detecting dark matter coupled to the spin of the electron, such that it may scatter and excite magnons - collective excitations of electronic spins. We show that materials exhibiting long-range magnetic order where the spins are coupled only along a plane may act as directional dark matter detectors. These quasi-2D materials possess anisotropic dispersion relations and structure functions which induce a sidereal modulation in the excitation rate. We calculate the expected signal rate for some candidate (anti)ferromagnets, demonstrating a possible route to the direct detection of spin-dependent dark matter in the keV to MeV mass range.</p>

<h1 id="supernova-5">supernova (5)</h1>

<p>2025-01-30, <strong>Variability of the UV luminosity function with SPICE</strong>, Arghyadeep Basu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18559v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.18559v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the variability of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) at $z &gt; 5$ using the SPICE suite of cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, which include three distinct supernova (SN) feedback models: bursty-sn, smooth-sn, and hyper-sn. The bursty-sn model, driven by intense and episodic SN explosions, produces the highest fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR). Conversely, the smooth-sn model, characterized by gentler SN feedback, results in minimal SFR variability. The hyper-sn model, featuring a more realistic prescription that incorporates hypernova (HN) explosions, exhibits intermediate variability, closely aligning with the smooth-sn trend at lower redshifts. These fluctuations in SFR significantly affect the $\rm{M_{UV} - M_{halo}}$ relation, a proxy for UVLF variability. Among the models, bursty-sn produces the highest UVLF variability, with a maximum value of 2.5. In contrast, the smooth-sn and hyper-sn models show substantially lower variability, with maximum values of 1.3 and 1.5, respectively. However, in all cases, UVLF variability strongly correlates with host halo mass, with lower-mass halos showing greater variability due to more effective SN feedback in their shallower gravitational wells. The bursty-sn model, though, results in higher amplitudes. Variability decreases in lower mass haloes with decreasing redshift for all feedback models. This study underscores the critical role of SN feedback in shaping the UVLF, and highlights the mass and redshift dependence of its variability, suggesting that UVLF variability may alleviate the bright galaxy tension observed by JWST at high redshifts.</p>

<p>2025-01-30, <strong>Quintessential Implications of the presence of AdS in the Dark Energy sector</strong>, Purba Mukherjee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18335v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.18335v1</a></p>

<p>We explore the implications of incorporating an Anti-de Sitter (AdS) vacua in the Dark Energy (DE) sector using the recent DESI BAO measurements in combination with Planck-2018 CMB, Pantheon-Plus(+SH0ES) supernovae and KiDS weak lensing data. We show that the presence of a {\it Negative Cosmological Constant} ($\Lambda &lt; 0$, nCC) together with an evolving part (modelled by the CPL parametrisation) in DE sector allows a {\it non-phantom} region for the DE in the constrained parameter space consistent with different observational data. This essentially solves the problem of {\it phantom} behaviour in the DE sector which is difficult to obtain through reasonable field theory. The implications nCC in the DE sector for different cosmological tensions are also studied. Our findings highlight the importance of the presence of AdS in the DE sector for theoretical model building, especially in the context of quantum gravity theories, e.g. string theory.</p>

<p>2025-01-30, <strong>TRIPP: A General Purpose Data Pipeline for Astronomical Image Processing</strong>, Alex Thomas et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18142v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.18142v1</a></p>

<p>We present the TRansient Image Processing Pipeline (TRIPP), a transient and variable source detection pipeline that employs both difference imaging and light curve analysis techniques for astronomical data. Additionally, we demonstrate TRIPP’s rapid analysis capability by detecting transient candidates in near-real time. TRIPP was tested using image data of the supernova SN2023ixf and from the Local Galactic Transient Survey (LGTS) collected by the Las Cumbres Observatory’s (LCO) network of 0.4 m telescopes. To verify the methods employed by TRIPP, we compare our results to published findings on the photometry of SN2023ixf. Additionally, we report the ability of TRIPP to detect transient signals from optical Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) sources.</p>

<p>2025-01-30, <strong>Unusual X-ray Oxygen Line Ratios of SN 1987A Arising From the Absorption of Galactic Hot Interstellar Medium</strong>, Lei Sun et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18091v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.18091v1</a></p>

<p>Recent high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic studies have revealed unusual oxygen line ratios, such as the high O VII forbidden-to-resonance ratio, in several supernova remnants. While the physical origin is still under debate, for most of them, it has been suggested that this phenomenon arises from either charge exchange (CX) or resonant scattering (RS). In this work, we report the high O VII G-ratio ($\gtrsim1$) and high O VIII Ly$\beta$/Ly$\alpha$ ratio ($\gtrsim0.2$) found in multiepoch XMM-Newton RGS observations of SN 1987A. The line ratios cannot be fully explained by non-equilibrium ionization effects, CX, or RS. We suggest the absorption of foreground hot gas as the most likely origin, which plays the major role in modifying line fluxes and line ratios. Based on this scenario, we introduced two Gaussian absorption components at the O VII resonance line and the O VIII Ly$\alpha$ line and constrained the optical depth of the two lines as $\tau_{\rm OVII}\sim0.6$ and $\tau_{\rm OVIII}\sim0.2$. We estimated the temperature as $kT_{\rm e}\sim0.18$ keV and the oxygen column density as $N_{\rm O}\sim0.8\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the absorbing gas, which is consistent with the hot interstellar medium in the Galactic halo. Neglecting this absorption component may lead to an underestimation {of} the O abundance. We revised the O abundance of SN 1987A, which is increased by $\sim20\%$ compared with previous results. The N/O ratio by number of atoms is revised to be $\sim1.2$.</p>

<p>2025-01-30, <strong>Evolution of X-ray Gas in SN 1987A from 2007 to 2021: Ring Fading and Ejecta Brightening Unveiled through Differential Emission Measure Analysis</strong>, Lei Sun et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18090v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.18090v1</a></p>

<p>As the nearest supernova (SN) observed since Kepler’s SN of 1604, SN 1987A provides an unprecedented opportunity to study in detail the early evolution of supernova remnants (SNRs). Despite extensive studies through both observations and simulations, there is still an urgent need for a more effective approach to integrate the results from two sides. In this study, we conducted a detailed differential emission measure (DEM) analysis on the XMM-Newton observations taken in 2007 to 2021 to characterize the continuous temperature structure of SN 1987A, which can be better compared with simulations. The X-ray plasma exhibit a temperature distribution with a major peak at $\sim0.5$-$1$ keV and a high-temperature tail extending to $\gtrsim5$ keV. The emission measure (EM) of the major peak started to decline around 2014, while the EM of the tail continued increasing and appears to have formed a secondary peak at $\sim3$-$5$ keV in recent years. Our DEM results consistent well with simulations, which help to further identify the major peak as originating from the equatorial ring and the secondary peak as arising from the newly shocked ejecta. Together with the simulations, our DEM analysis reveals recent fading of the ring and brightening of the ejecta in X-rays from SN 1987A. Additionally, we observed a recent decrease in the centroid energy of Fe K line, providing further evidence of newly shocked ejecta.</p>
