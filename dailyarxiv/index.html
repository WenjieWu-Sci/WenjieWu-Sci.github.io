<p>2025-07-08, <strong>12-Years Observation of Seasonal Variation of Atmospheric Neutrino Flux with IceCube</strong>, Shuyang Deng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06155v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06155v1</a></p>

<p>High-energy atmospheric muon neutrinos are detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory with a high rate of almost a hundred thousand events per year. Being mainly produced in meson decays in cosmic-ray-induced air showers in the upper atmosphere, the flux of these neutrinos is expected to depend on atmospheric conditions and thus features a seasonal variation. The correlation between temperature fluctuations and variations of the neutrino rates can be described with a slope parameter $\alpha$, whose previous measurement with 6 years of IceCube data indicated a discrepancy to theoretical expectations. In this work, we present an update of the previous analysis, extending the statistics to 12-years of IceCube data, as well as adding a region in the Northern Hemisphere to the analysis. We estimate the slope parameter in the Southern Hemisphere to be $\alpha=0.325\pm0.022$, which confirms the previous observation of the tension between the theoretical predictions and experimental measurements with significance $&gt;3\sigma$. Furthermore, the seasonal variation in the Northern Hemisphere has also been observed for the first time, with $\alpha=0.731\pm0.222$. Investigations into systematic effects reveal that the observations not only show a weaker correlation compared to the predictions, but also deviate from the expected linear relation between the atmospheric neutrino flux and the atmospheric temperature.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Impact of flavour coupling on $SO(10)$-inspired leptogenesis</strong>, Pasquale Di Bari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06144v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06144v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the impact of flavour coupling on the predictions of low energy neutrino parameters from $SO(10)$-inspired leptogenesis (SO10INLEP). The right-handed (RH) neutrino mass spectrum is strongly hierarchical and successful leptogenesis relies on generating the asymmetry from next-to-lightest RH neutrino decays ($N_2$-leptogenesis) and circumventing the lightest RH neutrino washout. These two conditions yield distinctive predictions such as a lower bound on the lightest neutrino mass $m_1 \gtrsim 1\,{\rm meV}$. We first review the status of SO10INLEP, noticing how cosmological observations are now testing a particular neutrino mass window, $m_1 \simeq (10$–$30)\,{\rm meV}$, where only the first octant is allowed and a large range of values for the Dirac phase is excluded. Including flavour coupling, we find that the lower bound relaxes to $m_1 \gtrsim 0.65\,{\rm meV}$. Moreover, new muon-dominated solutions appear slightly relaxing the upper bound on the atmospheric mixing angle. We also study the impact on strong thermal SO10INLEP (ST-SO10INLEP) scenario where, in addition to successful leptogenesis, one can washout a large pre-existing asymmetry. Contrarily to naive expectations, for which flavour coupling could jeopardise the scenario, allowing a large pre-existing asymmetry to survive unconditionally, we show, and explain analytically, that ST-SO10INLEP is still viable within almost the same allowed region of parameters. There is even a slight relaxation of the $m_1$ viable window from (9–30)meV to (4–40)meV for a $10^{-3}$ pre-existing asymmetry. The new results from atmospheric neutrinos, mildly favouring normal ordering and first octant, are now in nice agreement with the predictions of ST-SO10INLEP. Intriguingly, the predicted $0\nu\beta\beta$ signal is starting to be within the reach of KamLAND-Zen.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Constraining the contribution of Seyfert galaxies to the diffuse neutrino flux in light of point source observations</strong>, Lena Saurenhaus et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06110v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06110v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, the IceCube Collaboration reported evidence for TeV neutrino emission from several nearby Seyfert galaxies, with the highest significance found for NGC 1068. Assuming stochastic proton acceleration in magnetized turbulence inside the corona, we model the neutrino emission of Seyfert galaxies as a function of their X-ray luminosity. Applying our model to NGC 1068, we obtain a good fit to the public IceCube data and constrain the coronal radius to $\lesssim 5 R_S$ by comparing our MeV $\gamma$-ray predictions to Fermi-LAT observations. Extending to the full Seyfert population, we estimate their diffuse neutrino contribution and find that they can explain a significant fraction of the observed flux below $10\,\mathrm{TeV}$. However, scenarios with highly turbulent coronae and high cosmic-ray pressure across the population are ruled out. In particular, if all sources shared the best-fit parameters obtained for NGC 1068, their cumulative neutrino emission would exceed current upper limits at TeV energies by $3.8\sigma$. Our results, informed by both neutrino and $\gamma$-ray data, show that those Seyfert galaxies that emerge as neutrino point sources must be exceptionally efficient neutrino emitters and are not representative of the broader population.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Combining IceCube Muon Tracks and Cascades to measure the Galactic Diffuse Neutrino Flux</strong>, Jonas Hellrung et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06089v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06089v1</a></p>

<p>The diffuse Galactic neutrino flux is produced by cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium. The measurement of this flux can help to understand the distribution of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. The first observation of this neutrino flux was published in 2023 by the IceCube Collaboration. Here, plans for a new analysis combining different event topologies are presented. IceCube measures events in two main topologies. Tracks, originating in charged current $\nu_\mu$ interactions, provide a better angular resolution. In contrast, cascades, from most other possible interactions, provide a better energy resolution and are able to observe the Southern sky (and therefore the Galactic Center) despite the huge background of atmospheric muons. Combining both event topologies in one analysis exploits all these advantages. Sensitivities and model discrimination power of a combined measurement using a forward folding binned likelihood fit are discussed here.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>A First Determination of the LHC Neutrino Fluxes from FASER Data</strong>, Jukka John et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06022v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06022v1</a></p>

<p>The detection of TeV neutrinos from the LHC by the far-forward detectors FASER and SND@LHC enables a plethora of novel physics opportunities. Among these, the measurement of the flavour, energy, and rapidity dependence of the LHC forward neutrino fluxes provides unique constraints on theoretical predictions of forward particle production in hadronic collisions. We demonstrate that neutrino event yield measurements at FASER from Run 3 and at its HL-LHC upgrades enable a theory-agnostic extraction of the LHC forward neutrino fluxes. We exploit the equivalence of the problem with the determination of parton distributions from deep-inelastic structure functions to apply the NNPDF approach, based on machine learning regression and the Monte Carlo replica method, to LHC neutrino fluxes. The resulting NN$\nu$flux methodology is validated through closure tests and applied to a first extraction of the LHC muon neutrino flux from the FASER 2024 data. We show how NN$\nu$flux can discriminate between event generators of forward hadron production; scrutinize a possible intrinsic charm component in the proton; and constrain BSM scenarios with enhanced decays of neutral hadrons into neutrinos.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Measurement of the Diffuse Astrophysical Neutrino Spectrum above a TeV with All Flavor Starting Events in IceCube</strong>, Vedant Basu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06002v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06002v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory utilizes the Cherenkov radiation emitted by charged secondary particles produced in interactions of neutrinos with ice nucleons to detect neutrino events. “Starting events”, where this interaction vertex is contained inside the detector volume, can be used to distinguish neutrinos from the dominant background of atmospheric through-going muons. We present the Medium Energy Starting Events (MESE) selection, which employs a series of vetoes to obtain a neutrino-pure sample to measure the flux of diffuse extragalactic neutrinos from 1 TeV to 10 PeV from the entire sky. In this talk we will present a measurement of the spectrum of the diffuse flux of neutrinos, which demonstrates strong evidence for structure in the spectrum beyond a single power law, with a significance of $4.2\,\sigma$.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Right-handed neutrino dark matter consistent with the generation of baryon number asymmetry</strong>, Daijiro Suematsu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05957v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05957v1</a></p>

<p>A right-handed neutrino is a promising candidate for dark matter (DM) which has no interaction with nuclei. Since two right-handed neutrinos explain neutrino oscillation data and baryon number asymmetry through seesaw mechanism and leptogenesis based on the out-of-equilibrium decay of the lighter one, the lightest third right-handed neutrino could be free from them and stable to be DM. It suggests a possibility that the right-handed neutrinos could be common key particles for the explanation of three problems in the standard model (SM). We study this possibility by analyzing the structure of a neutrino mass matrix in the scotogenic model for neutrino mass.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Search for Sub-Relativistic Magnetic Monopoles with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</strong>, Jonas Häußler et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05896v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05896v1</a></p>

<p>Magnetic monopoles are beyond standard model particles, predicted by Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) to be created during the early universe. At typical masses of the GUT-scale - above $10^{14}$ GeV - these particles would move at sub-relativistic speeds. The Rubakov-Callan effect predicts that magnetic monopoles can catalyze nucleon decays, in particular the decay of protons. This results in a unique signature of small particle cascades along the trajectory of the slow moving magnetic monopole. Since 2012, a dedicated Slow-Particle Filter has been implemented in the IceCube Neutrino Observatory for the detection of magnetic monopoles. Current limits set an upper bound for the monopole flux at $\Phi_{\mathrm{90}}\leq 10^{-17}$ to $10^{-18} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$ depending on the catalysis cross section for the proton decay. A detection of the monopole flux thus requires exceptional background rejection and signal efficiency. This is accomplished using machine learning methods. In this analysis, we use a multi-level boosted decision tree classifier. We present the strategy behind the background and signal simulation, the classification efficiency, and IceCube’s projected sensitivity for the detection of sub-relativistic magnetic monopoles.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Cosmic-Ray Physics in the PeV to EeV Energy Range with the IceCube-Gen2 Surface Array (ICRC 2025)</strong>, Frank G. Schröder et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05841v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05841v1</a></p>

<p>IceCube-Gen2 is a proposed neutrino observatory at the South Pole that will build on the success of IceCube and will also serve as a unique detector for cosmic-ray air showers. Analogous to the IceTop surface array over IceCube’s deep optical detector, IceCube-Gen2 will also feature a surface array above the optical array deep in the ice. As improvement over IceTop, the IceCube-Gen2 surface array will be comprised of elevated detectors to avoid snow coverage, and will combine two types of detectors: scintillation panels that measure air-shower particles on ground and enable a low detection threshold, which is important to serve as a veto for selecting downgoing neutrino candidates, and radio antennas which increase the measurement accuracy for air showers by providing a calorimetric measurement of the electromagnetic shower component and its depth of maximum, $X_\mathrm{max}$. As another major advantage, the eight times larger surface area combined with a larger field of view will provide a 30-fold increase for the aperture of surface-deep coincident events. With these improvements in statistics and measurement accuracy, IceCube-Gen2 will thus make unique contributions to the particle physics and astrophysics of Galactic cosmic rays in the PeV to EeV energy range, including the search for PeV photon sources. This proceeding summarizes the technical design and science case enabled by the IceCube-Gen2 Surface Array.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Improved Gamma-Hadron Separation for PeV Photon Searches with IceCube (ICRC 2025)</strong>, Frank G. Schröder et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05833v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05833v1</a></p>

<p>IceTop, the km$^2$ surface array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole, is sensitive to air showers of all primary particles, including gamma rays. In particular, in the PeV energy range, the combination of IceTop and IceCube’s deep optical detector provides excellent gamma-hadron separation. Almost all air showers induced by cosmic-ray protons and heavier nuclei in this energy range contain high-energy muons detectable by the deep detector, while most photon-induced air showers do not. Therefore, IceCube’s deep detector can be used to strongly suppress hadronic background in photon searches. Furthermore, the lateral distribution of the air-shower signal in IceTop provides additional gamma-hadron separation. In the PeV energy range, the gamma-hadron separation achieved is better than $10^{-3}$: air-shower events measured with IceCube are suppressed more than 1000 times stronger than photon-induced showers of the same energy simulated with Sibyll 2.3d. This improved gamma-hadron separation in combination with an extension of the energy range to lower energies provides discovery potential for future searches for PeV photon sources in IceCube’s field of view.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Constraints on the diffuse flux of multi-PeV astrophysical neutrinos obtained with the Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector</strong>, V. A. Allakhverdyan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05769v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05769v1</a></p>

<p>Various theoretical models predict cosmic neutrinos with multi-PeV energies. The recent detection of a ~10^17 eV neutrino in the KM3NeT experiment suggests that these energetic particles can be studied with present-day installations. Here, we present upper limits on the flux of astrophysical neutrinos with energies (10^15.5 - 10^20) eV obtained with the largest liquid-water neutrino telescope, Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector (GVD), using cascade-like events. We discuss astrophysical implications of these results and constrain several cosmogenic neutrino scenarios using a combination of Baikal-GVD, KM3NeT, IceCube and Auger data.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Quantitative U/Th deposition and cleanliness control strategies in the JUNO site air</strong>, Jie Zhao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05759v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05759v1</a></p>

<p>The Jiangmen underground neutrino observatory (JUNO) is made of a 20 kt liquid scintillator (LS) detector at a depth of 700 m underground. In order to meet all physics requirements, the $^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th content in the LS is required to reach a level of 10$^{-17}$ g/g. However, the radioactivity of dust in the air is about 12 orders of magnitude higher than that, so there is an extremely high requirement for the cleanliness of the installation environment on site. In this study, a clean room management mode was implemented in the 120,000 m$^3$ space of the JUNO underground experimental main hall, to control the environmental cleanliness at a level equivalent to a class 10,000-100,000 clean room. Additionally, we designed a method to directly measure the deposition rate of $^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th on the surface of the detector. Based on ICP-MS detection, the sensitivity to $^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th concentrations can reach the level of picograms (pg). This helps to implement the cleanliness control strategies and to assess the level of external contamination during the construction of the detector.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Analytical description of the radio Cherenkov cone</strong>, Valentin Decoene et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05735v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05735v1</a></p>

<p>Radio emissions from extensive air showers (EAS) provide a valuable tool for detecting ultra-high-energy (UHE) astroparticles. In this context, several radio arrays focus on detecting highly inclined EAS, as this enables the observation of Earth-skimming UHE neutrinos, in addition to cosmic rays and gamma rays. The reconstruction of such inclined events relies heavily on a thorough understanding of the radio features observed on the ground, with the Cherenkov cone being one of the most prominent. In this study, we demonstrate that the Cherenkov cone can be accurately described for inclined air showers using basic propagation principles. Furthermore, we have developed an analytical model that computes the expected opening angles of the cone and reproduces the asymmetry effects observed in simulations. The high accuracy of these computations can enhance current reconstruction methods and pave the way for the development of new ones.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>$WWh$ anomalous couplings at one loop from a seesaw variant of radiatively-induced neutrino masses</strong>, Héctor Novales-Sánchez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05574v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05574v1</a></p>

<p>After the successful measurement of the Higgs-like particle at the Large Hadron Collider, the determination of whether it corresponds to either the minimal version of the Higgs scalar, provided by the Standard Model, or to some new physics, so far unknown, has become a main objective of the high-energy-physics community. In particular, the investigation of the couplings of this particle with the rest of the Standard-Model field content is a central task. To this aim, in the present paper we consider a variant of the seesaw neutrino-mass-generating mechanism in which the masses of light neutrinos are generated via radiative corrections of the neutrino 2-point function. In this framework, we calculate the contributions from virtual Majorana neutrinos to the $WWh$ vertex, at one loop. A set of anomalous couplings, some of them $CP$-even and the others $CP$-odd, emerge from this calculation. We perform numerical estimations of these anomalous couplings by taking into account the role of the $WWh$ vertex in (1) $Wh$ production from $pp$ collisions and (2) in Higgs production by vector-boson fusion, occurring in some lepton collider. Our estimations show that all the generated anomalous couplings are beyond current experimental sensitivity. However, we note that $CP$-conserving anomalous couplings could be as large as $\sim10^{-3}$, which would be near the reach of the high-luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider. On the other hand, $CP$-odd effects, amounting to $\sim10^{-4}$, turn out to be well below expectations for the Compact Linear Collider by about 2 orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Tribrid Inflation, Type II Leptogenesis, and Observable Gravitational Waves in $SU(3)<em>c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)</em>{B-L}$</strong>, Waqas Ahmed et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05564v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05564v1</a></p>

<p>We present a concrete realization of tribrid inflation within the framework of the gauge group $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$. In this model, inflation is driven by the neutral components of left-handed Higgs triplets, which also play a central role in generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via non-thermal leptogenesis. Tiny neutrino masses arise naturally through a type-II seesaw mechanism, facilitated by right-handed triplet fields. Supergravity corrections, stemming from the leading-order terms in a non-minimal K"ahler potential, are essential in bringing the predictions of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ into agreement with the latest cosmological data, including the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6, Planck 2018, and LB-BK18. A key feature of this model is the existence of a viable parameter space that predicts potentially observable primordial gravitational waves, with a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 0.005$, placing it within reach of upcoming experiments.</p>

<p>Within the Composite Higgs paradigm, Partial Compositeness has emerged as an elegant mechanism for generating large flavor hierarchies such as are observed in the quark and lepton masses and mixings. This mechanism exploits the strong renormalization group effects of the compositeness dynamics when these are {\it not} flavor-symmetric. Despite its remarkable properties, at this point it is stringently constrained by the body of flavor- and CP-violation tests, so that the compositeness scale must be at least $O(100)$ TeV, beyond the direct reach of proposed colliders. On the other hand, Composite Higgs theories with flavor-symmetric strong dynamics, but with realistic flavor-violating hierarchies introduced in an ad hoc manner, can extend the GIM mechanism of the standard model and thereby be far less constrained, at the edge of LHC reach and well within reach of future colliders. We show how the best features of both these types of dynamics can be combined if flavor-symmetries of the strong composite dynamics are emergent in the IR near the compositeness scale but absent in the far UV. In this case, flavor hierarchies can be generated by the renormalization group flow in the UV, followed by an IR stage in which the dynamics flows towards accidental flavor and CP symmetries. We point out how the collider and low-energy phenomenology is significantly impacted by the IR stage. Our analysis includes a discussion of the distinctive features of the small neutrino masses and their large mixings.</p>

<p>SoLid is a neutrino experiment at very-short baseline searching for active-to-sterile oscillations of reactor antineutrinos. The detection principle is based on the pairing of two types of solid scintillators: polyvinyl toluene and $^6$Li:ZnS(Ag), which is a new technology used in this field of Physics. In addition to good neutron-gamma discrimination, this setup allows the detector to be highly segmented; the basic detection unit is a 5 cm cube. High segmentation provides numerous advantages including precise localisation of the Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) products, the derivation of an antineutrino energy estimator based on the isolated positron energy, and a powerful background reduction tool that relies on the topological signature of the signal. Finally, the system is read out by a network of WLS fibres coupled to photosensors. A relative electromagnetic calibration is performed with horizontal cosmic muons. This source poses the simplest calibration problem in which a single detection unit is involved. In addition, large muon energy deposits allow us to perform a calibration at the most detailed level (i.e. per fibre) and to accurately define the fraction of energy escaping to neighbouring detection cells. A statistical precision at the sub-percent level is reached. The paper also discusses two methods to calibrate the absolute energy scale. The first method relies on horizontal muons, though the precision is limited to around 10\% because of the uncertainty in the energy distribution of such muons. A novel, alternative method based on the radioactive AmBe source is proposed. It takes advantage of the electron-positron pair-production process and provides a calibration point at 3.4 MeV (i.e. in the core of the IBD positron spectrum). The paper is concluded with various cross-check including a determination of the energy spectrum of the standard cosmogenic background candle: $^{12}$B.</p>

<p>In this work, we explore the influence of off-diagonal non-standard interaction (NSI) parameters on quantum entanglement within the three-flavor neutrino oscillation framework. By expressing three key entanglement measures: Entanglement of Formation (EOF), Concurrence, and Negativity in terms of oscillation probabilities, we analyze how these quantum correlations are affected by the NSI parameters $\epsilon_{e\mu}$, $\epsilon_{e\tau}$, and $\epsilon_{\mu\tau}$, including their complex phases. Using the DUNE experiment as a benchmark, we find that NSI effects are most significant at low energies, with Negativity showing the highest sensitivity even at high energies. It is observed that $\epsilon_{e \mu}$ and $\epsilon_{e \tau}$ affect entanglement measures mainly through the appearance channel, while the impact of $\epsilon_{\mu \tau}$ on EOF, Concurrence, and Negativity is predominantly linked to the disappearance channel.</p>

<p>We evaluate global asymmetry in the luminosities of neutrinos emitted from rapidly-rotating proto-neutron stars (PNS’s). We build axisymmetric models of PNS’s in mechanical equilibrium with rotation by adding prescribed angular momentum distributions by hand to non-rotational PNS models, which are extracted from a one-dimensional (spherically symmetric) PNS cooling calculation at different times: (t=2, 6, 10, 20, 30)s after a supernova explosion. We then conduct two-dimensional (spatially axisymmetric) neutrino transport calculations on top of them with the matter profiles (and the spacetime geometry) fixed. We find for the rapidly-rotating models with (T/|W|\sim 5\times 10^{-2}) that the neutrino luminosity changes by (\sim 3 \% ) depending on the observer position. We give detailed analyses of the neutrino-hemispheres as well as the neutrino luminosities that are defined observer-wise. We also calculate the low-frequency ((\lesssim 1{\rm Hz})) gravitational waves produced by the neutrinos radiated asymmetrically. We find that those gravitational waves, if emitted from the Galactic center, can be detected by planned detectors such as B-DECIGO, DECIGO and AILA. Finally, we look for crossings in the energy-integrated angular distributions in momentum space for the electron neutrino sector, a signature of the fast flavor conversion. We find them near the PNS surface in all models.</p>

<p>We present a formula for the Dirac CP phase $\delta = \arg ( U_{e1} U_{e2} U_{\mu 3} U_{\tau 3} / U_{e3} \det U_{\rm MNS} )$, directly derived from the lepton mixing matrix in an arbitrary basis. In contrast to the numerically suppressed Jarlskog invariant, this expression is computationally simple and less sensitive to approximations. We apply the formula to derive perturbative corrections from charged-lepton mixing $s_{ij}^{e}$ to the underlying CP phase of neutrinos $\delta_{\nu}$. A compact analytic expressions $\delta = \delta_{\nu} + s_{12}^{e} D_{12} + s_{13}^{e} D_{13} + s_{23}^{e} D_{23}$ shows that these corrections can substantially exceed $O(10^{\circ})$, potentially within the reach of future long-baseline experiments such as DUNE and T2HK.</p>

<p>Constraining neutrino mass through cosmological observations relies on precise simulations to calibrate their effects on large scale structure, while these simulations must overcome computational challenges like dealing with large velocity dispersions and small intrinsic neutrino perturbations. We present an efficient N-body implementation with semi-linear neutrino mass response which gives accurate power spectra and halo statistics. We explore the necessity of correcting the expansion history caused by massive neutrinos and the transition between relativistic and non-relativistic components. The above method of including neutrino masses is built into the memory-, scalability-, and precision-optimized parallel N-body simulation code CUBE 2.0. Through a suite of neutrino simulations, we precisely quantify the neutrino mass effects on the nonlinear matter power spectra and halo statistics.</p>

<p>We study cosmic magnification beyond lensing in a late-time universe dominated by quintessence and cold dark matter. The cosmic magnification angular power spectrum, especially going beyond the well-known lensing effect, provides an independent avenue for investigating the properties of quintessence, and hence, dark energy. By analysing the magnification power spectrum at different redshifts, it is possible to extract new information about the large-scale imprint of dark energy, including whether we are able to disentangle different models from one another. Using three well-known quintessence models, we analyse the cosmic magnification angular power spectrum while taking relativistic corrections into account. We found that it will be difficult to distinguish between quintessence models, and quintessence from the cosmological constant, in lensing magnification angular power spectrum on large scales, at redshifts $z \,{\leq}\, 1$; whereas, when relativistic corrections are incorporated, the total magnification angular power spectrum holds the potential to distinguish between the models, at the given $z$. At $z \,{\geq}\, 3$, the lensing magnification angular power spectrum can be a reasonable approximation of the total magnification angular power spectrum. We also found that both the total relativistic and the Doppler magnification signals, respectively, surpass cosmic variance at $z \,{\leq}\, 0.5$: hence the effect may be detectable at the given $z$. On the other hand, the ISW and the time-delay magnification signals, respectively, are surpassed by cosmic variance on all scales, at epochs up to $z \,{=}\, 4.5$, with the gravitational-potential magnification signal being zero.</p>

<p>The merger of binary pulsars in dark matter (DM)-rich environments can result in DM particle accretion, leading to an increase in the individual pulsar masses. In this work, we investigate the effects of DM accretion on the change in orbital period rate of binary pulsars. Our analysis reveals that while DM accretion increases the system’s mass, it may also modify the orbital evolution by enhancing the orbital decay rate. By comparing our results with existing binary pulsar data near Earth’s location, we report that the current DM accretion rate is insufficient to place meaningful constraints on DM particle properties. However, we demonstrate that future observations of pulsar mergers in the high DM-density environment of the galactic center could offer a unique opportunity to probe DM microphysics through this mechanism.</p>

<p>In the light of new full-sky surveys, many attempts of creating a consistent Galactic model were made. The main interest is to estimate the still poorly understood dark matter content. However, the results vary depending on methodology, assumptions, and baryonic distribution used. To understand this discrepancy, we take the first step by estimating the model-free local mass density of stars and stellar remnants. We use a complete sample from the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars within 100 pc from the Sun, together with the data on the sample of the White Dwarfs and the recent estimate of the Neutron Stars concentration in the solar neighborhood. After correction for unresolved binary stars and accounting for missing low-mass stars, we find the local mass density of stars and stellar remnants in the solar neighborhood is $\rho_{100} = 0.040^{+0.012} _{ -0.006}M_\odot pc^{-3}$ with Kroupa IMF, and $\rho_{100} = 0.037^{+0.012}_{ -0.006}M_\odot pc^{-3}$ with Chabrier IMF.</p>

<p>We study scalar singlet extensions of the Standard Model (SM), focusing on scenarios where dark matter (DM) is stabilized by a (\mathbb{Z}_2) symmetry. In the minimal single-scalar extension of the SM, only a narrow region near the Higgs resonance remains viable, requiring small portal couplings in order to simultaneously satisfy the observed relic abundance and comply with the most recent direct detection limits from the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ-2024) and XENON1T experiments. To address this limitation, we extend the dark sector by introducing additional real singlet scalars. In both two- and three-singlet extensions, we demonstrate that the observed dark matter relic density can be accommodated with larger Higgs portal couplings. These couplings significantly impact early-Universe dynamics by enhancing the strength of the electroweak phase transition. Both the two- and three-singlet scalar extensions can induce a strong first-order electroweak phase transition, generating stochastic gravitational waves potentially observable at future space-based detectors such as LISA and DECIGO. Notably, the three-singlet scenario induce an even stronger transition compared to the two-singlet case, enhancing the gravitational wave signal strength. Our results highlight the potential of extended scalar sectors as testable frameworks connecting dark matter and gravitational wave signals.</p>

<p>We present the analysis of the stellar populations and kinematics of the globular cluster (GC) rich ultra-diffuse galaxy, PUDG-R21, using spectroscopic observations obtained with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). The recessional velocity is measured to be 5536$\pm$10 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$, confirming its association with the Perseus cluster. The galaxy exhibits mild rotation of 15.6$\pm$10 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$ and a stellar velocity dispersion of 19.4$\pm$3.5 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$ within the galaxy effective radius. From this, we infer a dynamical mass of M$_{\mathrm{dyn}}=9.3\pm3.3\times10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. Based on a halo mass derived from PUDG-R21 GC counts, we find our dynamical mass is consistent with a cored dark matter profile. The integrated stellar population analysis reveals a predominantly old stellar population of 10.4$\pm$1.2 Gyr, with intermediate-low metallicity ([M/H]=-0.64$\pm$0.12 dex) and elevated alpha abundances ([Mg/Fe]=0.38$\pm$0.25 dex). The inferred star formation history suggests rapid stellar assembly, likely truncating prior to or during the galaxy’s infall into the cluster at an early epoch ($\sim$10 Gyr ago). The analysis of stellar population gradients (age and metallicity) indicates a flat profile out to one effective radius. Here, we consider the involvement of two star formation events, initially forming a large population of metal-poor globular clusters, and then the latter contributing to the more metal-enriched diffuse stellar body. The evidence of subsequent star formation suggests this galaxy is more like an extension of the classical dwarf population than the much discussed failed galaxy UDGs.</p>

<p>We study a simple setup with dark matter halos in real space, with the amplitude of the linear density field $A$ as the only free cosmological parameter. We show that Eulerian perturbation theory is adequate for describing this system on large scales, compute the leading $n$-point functions and perform a joint power spectrum, bispectrum and trispectrum analysis. Beyond the bispectrum which is crucial for breaking the degeneracy between $A$ and the linear bias, we find that addition of the trispectrum reduces the error on $A$ by only $20-30\%$. Our results for the joint analysis are in good agreement with recent field-level analyses in the same setup. This implies that the field-level inference on large scales does not get significant information from large displacements beyond those in Eulerian kernels or higher-order $n$-point functions beyond the trispectrum. We provide further evidence for this showing that the dependence of the error bars on the maximum wavenumbers used in the analysis is the same in the two approaches. Our results are in disagreement with some of the recent joint power spectrum and bispectrum analyses using likelihood-free inference based on perturbative forward modeling. We discuss a possible origin of this discrepancy and highlight the importance of resolving it in order to have the optimal results in cosmological analyses based on perturbation theory.</p>

<p>The QCD axion addresses the strong CP problem and dark matter via the misalignment mechanism, typically requiring a decay constant $f_a\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{12}$ GeV), unless the initial misalignment angle ($\theta_i$) is fine-tuned. This work presents a novel approach where the possibility that the QCD axion satisfying the correct relic is extended over a broad range for $f_a\in [10^8, 10^{14}$] GeV without fine-tuning the $\theta_i$, by introducing a new phase of axion oscillation dynamics across the electroweak phase transition (EWPT). This mechanism, we call it {\it{recurrent ~misalignment}}, is a result of a non-renormalizable Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking interaction involving the axion and the sector responsible for making the EWPT of first order. The scenario not only enhances the QCD axion parameter space in terms of its detection possibility, but also provides a unique probe by detectable gravitational waves.</p>

<p>Next-generation radio telescopes will provide unprecedented data volumes of the neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution across cosmic time. Combining weak lensing surveys with spatial and kinematic observations of HI could help constrain key properties of dark matter, such as its mass, clustering behavior, and spatial distribution. However, inferring dark matter properties from HI observations is challenging because of processes related to galaxy formation, such as stellar feedback. Methods that use empirical relations, often calibrated via numerical simulations, do not use full field-level information to model the complex relation between dark matter and HI. We address this shortcoming with a data-driven approach, leveraging the recently introduced EMBER-2 model to learn the HI-dark matter mapping at the field level for a wide redshift range, z=6-0. After training on cosmological galaxy formation simulations run with FIRE-2, EMBER-2 accurately recovers key statistics, including dark matter mass fractions and surface density profiles. The HI-dark matter density cross-correlation is reconstructed at an accuracy of 10% down to scales of k = 100 h/cMpc, a significant improvement over traditional approaches. The presented method may become a key ingredient in future inference pipelines as it can be readily integrated into downstream analysis tasks of radio surveys.</p>

<p>A Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field $\phi$, responsible for the late-time cosmic acceleration and interacting with a coherent scalar field $\psi$ through an interaction potential $W(\phi,\psi)$, is considered from the point of view of particle physics for two different models. The non-minimal coupling between the GB curvature term and the field $\phi$ leads to a time-dependent speed of gravitational waves (GWs), which is fixed to unity in order to be consistent with current GW observations, rendering the GB coupling function model-independent. We investigate the dynamical stability of the system by formulating it in the form of an autonomous system, and constrain the model parameters using various sets of observational data. We find that both models are physically viable and closely follow the $\Lambda$CDM trend. We also use the updated Roman mock high redshift data to further constrain the parameters of the two models.</p>

<p>We analytically evaluate the currents in a planar-holed ideal (perfect magnetic shielding) superconductor when an axial dipole is located along the system’s axis, obtaining a simple relation between the fluxoid (in this geometry, it equals the flux) threading the hole, the net current circling it, and the magnitude and position of the dipole. This expression has to be added to the basic screening equations describing the superconductor to understand the different physical situations that can appear. Thus several scenarios are studied: field and zero-field cooling cases, where the flux threading the hole is fixed; superconductors with a slit where the net current circling the hole is zero; and self-inductance case, where the flux threading the hole is only due to the screening currents. All the presented results are analytical for the axial dipole and are given as a function of the distance of the dipole from the plane of the superconductor. The obtained results can serve as a benchmark for recent and ongoing micromechanical experiments aimed at developing ultrasensitive gravimeters or applications searching for exotic spin-dependent interactions and dark matter, for example.</p>

<p>Strong self-gravitational fields enable the realization of macroscopic odd-parity quantum objects. Using ray-tracing methods, we systematically analyze the shadow features of rotating black holes with parity-odd scalar hair and contrast them with those of Kerr black holes. Our results demonstrate measurable distinctions between scalar-haired black hole shadows and their Kerr counterparts. Notably, even for tiny scalar charge and negligible scalar hair mass contributions, these differences remain quantitatively resolvable. These findings provide critical theoretical benchmarks for future observational campaigns targeting scalar-field dark matter candidates through black hole shadow imaging.</p>

<p>This paper presents the exact ground state solution for a diatomic particle system with position-dependent complex mass under action of a complex Morse potential in the quantum domain. By solving the position-dependent Schr"odinger equation in extended complex phase space without assuming a specific mass profile, we derive both the eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenenergies using the analyticity conditions of the eigenfunctions. A key focus is placed on addressing the challenge of normalization inherent in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. To overcome the limitations of conventional normalization methods in systems with complex potentials and spatially varying mass, we propose a modified normalization approach based on a two-dimensional integral over phase space. The results reveal that, under certain parameter constraints, real energy spectra can arise in non Hermitian settings, supported by normalized and physically meaningful eigenfunctions. Probability density plots validate the existence of stable, localized bound states, maintaining essential characteristics of the traditional Morse potential. Moreover, the model offers potential applications in high-energy and cosmological physics, particularly in the quantum description of exotic systems like dark matter.</p>

<p>We present 0.3-21mic observations at ~275d and ~400d for Type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi, combining ground-based optical and near-infrared data from the Keck I/II telescopes and space-based infrared data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Although the optical regions dominate the observed flux, SN2024ggi is bright at infrared wavelengths (65%/35% falls each side of 1mic). SN2024ggi exhibits a plethora of emission lines from H, He, intermediate-mass elements (O, Na, Mg, S, Ar, Ca), and iron-group elements (IGEs; Fe, Co, and Ni) – all lines have essentially the same width, suggesting efficient macroscopic chemical mixing of the inner ejecta at &lt;~2000km/s and little mixing of 56Ni at larger velocities. Molecular emission in the infrared range is dominated by the CO fundamental, which radiates about 5% of the total SN luminosity. A molecule-free radiative-transfer model based on a standard red-supergiant star explosion (i.e., ~1e51erg, 0.06Msun of 56Ni from a 15.2Msun progenitor) yields a satisfactory match throughout the optical and infrared at both epochs. The SN2024ggi CO luminosity is comparable to the fractional decay-power absorbed in the model C/O-rich shell – accounting for CO cooling would likely resolve the model overestimate of the [OI]0.632mic flux. The relative weakness of the molecular emission in SN2024ggi and the good overall match obtained with our molecule-free model suggests negligible microscopic mixing – about 95% of the SN luminosity is radiated by atoms and ions. Lines from IGEs, which form from explosion ashes at such late times, are ideal diagnostics of the magnitude of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SN ejecta. Stable Ni, clearly identified in SN2024ggi (e.g., [NiII]6.634mic), is probably a common product of massive-star explosions.</p>

<p>We prove that the spin-aligned electromagnetic recoil force acting on a pulsar vanishes identically in Force-Free Electrodynamics. This contrasts with Hirai et al.’s recent argument that the rocket effect was important for explaining the eccentricity distribution of wide neutron star binaries found by Gaia. Our detailed analysis confirms that for a broad range of initial conditions and natal kick distributions, the rocket velocities of $v_r \gtrsim 30\, \mathrm{km/s}$ are required to account for the observed eccentricities. However, we find that in scenarios where the common envelope phase does not significantly shrink the initial orbit, and the natal kicks are drawn from Paczynski-type distribution, these eccentricities may arise without the influence of an EM rocket. If the natal kicks are perpendicular to the initial orbits, then explaining the Gaia neutron star eccentricities without invoking rockets additionally requires that the pre-supernova binaries avoid significant circularization, and that the mass loss during the supernova is minimal.   The rocket effect can only be substantial in “weak” pulsars, where pair production near the light cylinder is suppressed and ${\bf E}\cdot{\bf B} \neq 0$ in the outer magnetosphere. We derive a rough estimate for a rocket force in a weak pulsar and relate it to the pulsar’s radiative efficiency; simulations are needed to obtain numerically reliable expressions. If future observations prove that rockets are required to explain the data, this would imply that Gaia neutron stars are $\gtrsim $ Myr old, were previously rapidly spinning and are weakly magnetized, with a dipole field $\lesssim 10^{10}$ G and a relatively strong quadrupole component.</p>

<p>2025-07-07, <strong>Type Ibn supernovae from ultra-stripped supernova progenitors</strong>, Takashi J. Moriya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05506v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05506v1</a></p>

<p>Ultra-stripped supernovae are core-collapse supernovae from progenitors that lose a significant fraction of mass because of the binary interactions with their compact companion stars. Ultra-stripped supernovae have been connected to fast-evolving faint Type Ib or Ic supernovae. Here, we show that in some cases ultra-stripped supernovae can result in Type Ibn supernovae. Progenitors of ultra-stripped supernovae may trigger violent silicon burning shortly before the core collapse, leading to mass ejection that results in a dense circumstellar matter. By taking an ultra-stripped supernova progenitor that loses 0.2 Msun at 78 days before the core collapse, we compute the light-curve evolution of the ultra-stripped supernova within the dense circumstellar matter. The core collapse results in a supernova explosion with an ejecta mass of 0.06 Msun and an explosion energy of 9e49 erg. Because the dense circumstellar matter is more massive than the supernova ejecta, the ejecta are immediately decelerated and the light curve is powered mainly by the circumstellar interaction. Therefore, this ultra-stripped supernova is likely observed as a Type Ibn supernova. We suggest that some Type Ibn supernovae may originate from ultra-stripped supernova progenitors losing significant mass shortly before their explosion due to violent silicon burning.</p>

<p>Type Ia supernovae have provided fundamental observational data in the discovery of the late acceleration of the expansion of the Universe in cosmology. However, this analysis has relied on the assumption of a Gaussian distribution for the data, a hypothesis that can be challenged with the increasing volume and precision of available supernova data. In this work, we rigorously assess this Gaussianity hypothesis and analyze its impact on parameter estimation for dark energy cosmological models. We utilize the Pantheon+ dataset and perform a comprehensive statistical, analysis including the Lilliefors and Jarque-Bera tests, to assess the normality of both the data and model residuals. We find that the Gaussianity assumption is untenable and that the redshift distribution is more accurately described by a t-distribution, as indicated by the Kolmogorov Smirnov test. Parameters are estimated for a model incorporating a nonlinear cosmological interaction for the dark sector. The free parameters are estimated using multiple methods, and bootstrap confidence intervals are constructed for them.</p>

<p>The dynamical stability of differentially rotating neutron stars, including hypermassive neutron stars, is of paramount importance in understanding the fate of the post-merger remnant of binary neutron stars mergers and the formation of a black hole during core collapse supernovae. We study systematically the dynamical stability of differentially rotating neutron stars within a broad range of masses, rotation rates and degrees of differential rotation, modeled as polytropes with $\Gamma=2$. We pay particular attention to quasi-toroidal configurations that are outside the parameter space region explored in previous works. We estimate the limits of the region of stability against quasi-radial perturbations by performing an extensive set of numerical simulations. We find that some of the stability criteria proposed in the past are not sufficient nor necessary to determine stability if differential rotation is present and propose a new more general criterion. We show that there is a large parameter space that allows for quasi-toroidal configurations that will not collapse immediately to a black hole and that can sustain masses up to $\sim 2.5$ times the maximum mass of a non-rotating neutron star.</p>

<p>2025-07-07, <strong>Investigating the Impact of Supernova Feedback on Satellites in Elliptical Galaxies</strong>, Sumi Kim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05348v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05348v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the influence of supernova (SN) feedback on the satellites of elliptical host galaxies using hydrodynamic simulations. Utilizing a modified version of the GADGET-3 code, we perform cosmological zoom-in simulations of 11 elliptical galaxies with stellar masses in the range $10^{11} M_{\odot} &lt; M_{*} &lt; 2 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. We conduct two sets of simulations with identical initial conditions: the Fiducial model, which includes a three-phase SN mechanical wind, and the weak SN feedback model, where nearly all SN energy is released as thermal energy with a reduced SN wind velocity. Our comparison shows minimal differences in the elliptical host galaxies, but significant variations in the physical properties of satellite galaxies. The weak SN feedback model produces a larger number of satellite galaxies compared to the Fiducial model, and significantly more than observed. For satellite galaxies with stellar masses above $10^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$, the weak SN feedback model generates approximately five times more satellites than observed in the xSAGA survey. Most of these overproduced satellites have small stellar masses, below $10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$. Additionally, satellites in the weak SN feedback model are about 3.5 times more compact than those observed in the SAGA survey and the Fiducial model, with metallicities nearly 1 dex higher than observed values. In conclusion, the satellite galaxies in the Fiducial model, which includes mechanical SN feedback, exhibit properties more closely aligned with observations. This underscores the necessity of incorporating both mechanical AGN and SN feedback to reproduce the observed properties of elliptical galaxy and their satellites in simulations.</p>

<p>2025-07-07, <strong>Evolution of Dark Energies and Compact Objects in 4D Einstein Gauss Bonnet Gravity induced Universe A Data Based Perspective</strong>, Puja Mukherjee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05223v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05223v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmic evolution is the most sensational topic among researchers of modern cosmology. This article explores cosmic evolution in 4D Einstein Gauss Bonnet (EGB) gravity, focusing on mass accretion of compact objects (black holes and wormholes) by dark energy (DE). Three DE models Chevallier Polarski Linder (CPL), Jassal Bagla Padmanabhan (JBP), and Barboza Alcaniz (BA) parameterizations are studied within 4D EGB gravity, with their Hubble parameters derived and compared against observational data (Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and CMB). Bayesian analysis favors the CPL and BA models, with CPL providing the best fit. For black holes, mass accretion of CPL and JBP DE shows transitions between quintessence and phantom eras, while BA and LambdaCDM strictly exhibit quintessence-like behavior, driving cosmic acceleration. In contrast, wormholes exhibit the opposite trend, favoring a phantom-dominated era for the BA and LambdaCDM models. The study highlights the dynamic nature of DE in 4D EGB gravity and its role in cosmic expansion.</p>

<p>2025-07-07, <strong>A COMPASS to Model Comparison and Simulation-Based Inference in Galactic Chemical Evolution</strong>, Berkay Gunes et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05060v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05060v2</a></p>

<p>We present COMPASS, a novel simulation-based inference framework that combines score-based diffusion models with transformer architectures to jointly perform parameter estimation and Bayesian model comparison across competing Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. COMPASS handles high-dimensional, incomplete, and variable-size stellar abundance datasets. Applied to high-precision elemental abundance measurements, COMPASS evaluates 40 combinations of nucleosynthetic yield tables. The model strongly favours Asymptotic Giant Branch yields from NuGrid and core-collapse SN yields used in the IllustrisTNG simulation, achieving near-unity cumulative posterior probability. Using the preferred model, we infer a steep high-mass IMF slope and an elevated Supernova Ia normalization, consistent with prior solar neighbourhood studies but now derived from fully amortized Bayesian inference. Our results demonstrate that modern SBI methods can robustly constrain uncertain physics in astrophysical simulators and enable principled model selection when analysing complex, simulation-based data.</p>

<p>2025-07-07, <strong>Multidimensional Nebular-Phase Calculations of Dynamically-Driven Double-Degenerate Double-Detonation Models for Type Ia Supernovae</strong>, J. M. Pollin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05000v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05000v1</a></p>

<p>The dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation model has emerged as a promising progenitor candidate for Type Ia supernovae. In this scenario, the primary white dwarf ignites due to dynamical interaction with a companion white dwarf, which may also undergo a detonation. Consequently, two scenarios exist: one in which the secondary survives and another in which both white dwarfs detonate. In either case, substantial departures from spherical symmetry are imprinted on the ejecta. Here, we compute full non local thermodynamic equilibrium nebular-phase spectra in 1D and 3D to probe the innermost asymmetries. Our simulations reveal that the multidimensional structures significantly alter the overall ionisation balance, width and velocity of features, especially when the secondary detonates. In this scenario, some element distributions may produce orientation-dependent line profiles that can be centrally peaked from some viewing-angles and somewhat flat-topped from others. Comparison to observations reveals that both scenarios produce most observed features from the optical to mid-infrared. However, the current model realisations do not consistently reproduce all line shapes or relative strengths, and yield prominent optical Ar III emission which is inconsistent with the data. When the secondary detonates, including 3D effects, improves the average agreement with observations, however when compared to observations, particularly weak optical Co III emission and the presence of optical O I and near-infrared S I challenge its viability for normal Type Ia supernovae. Thus, our comparisons with normal Type Ia’s tentatively favour detonation of only the primary white dwarf, but we stress that more model realisations and mid-infrared observations are needed.</p>
