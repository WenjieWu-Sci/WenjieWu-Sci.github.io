<p>2023-05-11, <strong>Searching for temporary gamma-ray dark blazars associated with IceCube neutrinos</strong>, Emma Kun et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06729v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06729v1</a></p>

<p>Tensions between the diffuse gamma-ray sky observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and the diffuse high-energy neutrino sky detected by the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory question our knowledge about high-energy neutrino sources in the gamma-ray regime. While blazars are among the most energetic persistent particle accelerators in the Universe, studies suggest that they could account for up to for 10-30% of the neutrino flux measured by IceCube. Our recent results highlighted that the associated IceCube neutrinos arrived in a local gamma-ray minimum (dip) of three strong neutrino point-source candidates. We increase the sample of neutrino-source candidates to study their gamma-ray light curves. We generate the one-year Fermi-LAT light curve for 8 neutrino source candidate blazars (RBS 0958, GB6 J1040+0617, PKS 1313-333, TXS 0506+056, PKS 1454-354, NVSS J042025-374443, PKS 0426-380 and PKS 1502+106), centered on the detection time of the associated IceCube neutrinos. We apply the Bayesian block algorithm on the light curves to characterize their variability. Our results indicate that GB6 J1040+0617 was in the phase of high gamma-ray activity, while none of the other 7 neutrino source candidates were statistically bright during the detection of the corresponding neutrinos and that indeed even most of the times neutrinos arrived in a faint gamma-ray phase of the light curves. This suggests that the 8 source-candidate blazars (associated with 7 neutrino events) in our reduced sample are either not the sources of the corresponding IceCube neutrinos, or that an in-source effect (e.g. suppression of gamma rays due to high gamma-gamma opacity) complicates the multimessenger scenario of neutrino emission for these blazars.</p>

<p>2023-05-11, <strong>Interpreting the GeV-TeV Gamma-Ray Spectra of Local Giant Molecular Clouds using GEANT4 Simulation</strong>, Abhijit Roy et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06693v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06693v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray satellite has detected six Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) located in the Gould Belt and the Aquila Rift regions. In half of these objects (Taurus, Orion A, Orion B), the observed gamma-ray spectrum can be explained using the Galactic diffused Cosmic Ray (CR) interactions with the gas environments. In the remaining three GMCs (Rho Oph, Aquila Rift, Cepheus), the origin of the gamma-ray spectrum is still not well established. We use the GEometry ANd Tracking (GEANT4) simulation framework in order to simulate gamma-ray emission due to CR/GMC interaction in these three objects, taking into account the gas density distribution inside the GMCs. We find that propagation of diffused Galactic CRs inside these GMCs can explain the Fermi-LAT detected gamma-ray spectra. Further, our estimated TeV-PeV fluxes are consistent with the HAWC upper limits, available for the Aquila Rift GMC. As last step, we compute the total neutrino flux estimated for these GMCs and compare it with the IceCube detection sensitivity.</p>

<p>2023-05-11, <strong>Parameter space for testable leptogenesis</strong>, Yannis Georis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06663v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06663v1</a></p>

<p>Extending the Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos provides a minimal explanation for both light neutrino masses (through the type-I seesaw mechanism) and the baryon asymmetry of our universe (through leptogenesis). We map here for the first time the range of heavy neutrino mixing angle consistent with both neutrino masses and leptogenesis in a scenario with 3 generations of right-handed neutrinos with Majorana masses between 50 MeV and 70 TeV. Due to the presence of a third degree of freedom that remains much more feebly coupled to the Standard Model thermal bath, we observe that the parameter space is much larger compared to the minimal scenario with 2 generations. This greatly enhances the testability prospects for low-scale leptogenesis and, in the most optimistic scenario, would allow experimentalists not only to discover right-handed neutrinos but also to perform consistency checks of the model.</p>

<p>2023-05-11, <strong>Vacuum stability and Q-ball formation in the Type II Seesaw model</strong>, Naoyuki Haba et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06592v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06592v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate vacuum stability and Q-ball formation in the Type II seesaw model by considering the effective potential for scalar fields, taking into account renormalization effects. We find that the quartic coupling for the triplet Higgs can vanish at a high energy scale, creating a flat direction where Q-ball formation can occur. If Q-balls are produced, they eventually decay into leptons via neutrino Yukawa couplings with the triplet Higgs. If this decay occurs above the electroweak scale, the leptogenesis scenario can work, and the baryon number is produced via the sphaleron effect. We show that there are parameter regions where the above scenario occurs, taking into account phenomenological constraints.</p>

<p>2023-05-10, <strong>Probing the Local Dark Matter Halo with Neutrino Oscillations</strong>, Tony Gherghetta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06441v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06441v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter particles can form halos gravitationally bound to massive astrophysical objects. The Earth could have such a halo where depending on the particle mass, the halo either extends beyond the surface or is confined to the Earthâs interior. We consider the possibility that if dark matter particles are coupled to neutrinos, then neutrino oscillations can be used to probe the Earthâs dark matter halo. In particular, atmospheric neutrinos traversing the Earth can be sensitive to a small size, interior halo, inaccessible by other means. Depending on the halo mass and neutrino energy, constraints on the dark matter-neutrino couplings are obtained from the halo corrections to the neutrino oscillations.</p>

<p>2023-05-10, <strong>Neutrino CPT violation in the solar sector</strong>, Gabriela Barenboim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06384v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06384v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper we place new bounds on CPT violation in the solar neutrino sector analyzing the results from solar experiments and KamLAND. We also discuss the sensitivity of the next-generation experiments DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande, which will provide accurate measurements of the solar neutrino oscillation parameters. The joint analysis of both experiments will further improve the precision due to cancellations in the systematic uncertainties regarding the solar neutrino flux. In combination with the next-generation reactor experiment JUNO, the bound on CPT violation in the solar sector could be improved by one order of magnitude in comparison with current constraints. The distinguishability among CPT-violating neutrino oscillations and neutrino non-standard interactions in the solar sector is also addressed.</p>

<p>2023-05-10, <strong>A Leptonic Model for Neutrino Emission From Active Galactic Nuclei</strong>, Dan Hooper et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06375v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06375v1</a></p>

<p>It is often stated that the observation of high-energy neutrinos from an astrophysical source would constitute a smoking gun for the acceleration of hadronic cosmic rays. Here, we point out that there exists a purely leptonic mechanism to produce TeV-scale neutrinos in astrophysical environments. In particular, very high energy synchrotron photons can scatter with X-rays, exceeding the threshold for muon-antimuon pair production. When these muons decay, they produce neutrinos without any cosmic-ray protons or nuclei being involved. In order for this mechanism to be efficient, the source in question must feature both kG-scale magnetic fields and a high density of keV-scale photons. As an example, we consider the active galaxy NGC 1068, which IceCube has recently detected as a source of TeV-scale neutrinos. We find that the neutrino emission observed from this source could potentially be generated through muon pair production for reasonable choices of physical parameters.</p>

<p>2023-05-10, <strong>Twin Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter</strong>, Ian Holst et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06364v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06364v1</a></p>

<p>We propose that the dark matter of our universe could be sterile neutrinos which reside within the twin sector of a mirror twin Higgs model. In our scenario, these particles are produced through a version of the Dodelson-Widrow mechanism that takes place entirely within the twin sector, yielding a dark matter candidate that is consistent with X-ray and gamma-ray line constraints. Furthermore, this scenario can naturally avoid the cosmological problems that are typically encountered in mirror twin Higgs models. In particular, if the sterile neutrinos in the Standard Model sector decay out of equilibrium, they can heat the Standard Model bath and reduce the contributions of the twin particles to $N_\mathrm{eff}$. Such decays also reduce the effective temperature of the dark matter, thereby relaxing constraints from large-scale structure. The sterile neutrinos included in this model are compatible with the seesaw mechanism for generating Standard Model neutrino masses.</p>

<p>2023-05-10, <strong>On the degeneracies between baryons, massive neutrinos and f(R) gravity in Stage IV cosmic shear analyses</strong>, A. Spurio Mancini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06350v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06350v1</a></p>

<p>Modelling nonlinear structure formation is essential for current and forthcoming cosmic shear experiments. We combine the halo model reaction formalism, implemented in the REACT code, with the COSMOPOWER machine learning emulation platform, to develop and publicly release REACTEMU-FR, a fast and accurate nonlinear matter power spectrum emulator for $f(R)$ gravity with massive neutrinos. Coupled with the state-of-the-art baryon feedback emulator BCEMU, we use REACTEMU-FR to produce Markov Chain Monte Carlo forecasts for a cosmic shear experiment with typical Stage IV specifications. We find that the inclusion of highly nonlinear scales (multipoles between $1500\leq \ell \leq 5000$) only mildly improves constraints on most standard cosmological parameters (less than a factor of 2). In particular, the necessary modelling of baryonic physics effectively damps most constraining power on the sum of the neutrino masses and modified gravity at $\ell \gtrsim 1500$. Using an approximate baryonic physics model produces mildly improved constraints on cosmological parameters which remain unbiased at the $1\sigma$-level, but significantly biases constraints on baryonic parameters at the $&gt; 2\sigma$-level.</p>

<p>2023-05-10, <strong>Complete complementarity relations for three-flavor neutrino oscillations</strong>, Massimo Blasone et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06095v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06095v1</a></p>

<p>We exploit complete complementarity relations to characterize quantum correlations encoded in a three-flavor oscillating neutrino system. In particular, we analyze the contributions associated to the twoflavor subsystems, each of which exhibits a particular internal structure. We focus on the behavior of the correlations at large distances, both for an initial electron and muon neutrino state. Our analysis is based on the wave packet approach in which the neutrino is represented by a mixed state: consequently, the bipartite correlations are described by the Quantum Discord.</p>

<p>2023-05-10, <strong>Sensitivity of Transition-Edge Sensors to Strong DC Electric Fields</strong>, K. M. Patel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06032v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06032v1</a></p>

<p>Transition-edge sensors (TESs) have found a wide range of applications in both space- and land-based astronomical photon measurement and are being used in the search for dark matter and neutrino mass measurements. A fundamental aspect of TES physics that has not been investigated is the sensitivity of TESs to strong DC electric fields (10 kV/m and above). Understanding the resilience of TESs to DC electric fields is essential when considering their use as charged particle spectrometers, a field in which TESs could have an enormous impact. Techniques such as x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy produce a high number of low-energy electrons that are not of interest and can be screened from the detector using electrostatic deflection. The use of strong electric fields could also provide a mass-efficient route to prevent secondary electron measurements arising from cosmic radiation in space-based TES applications. Integrating electron optics into the TES membrane provides an elegant and compact means to control the interaction between charged particles and the sensor, whether by screening unwanted particles or enhancing the particle absorption efficiency but implementing such techniques requires understanding the sensitivity of the TES to the resulting electric fields. In this work, we applied a uniform DC electric field across a Mo/Au TES using a parallel pair of flat electrodes positioned above and below the TES. The electric field in the vicinity of the TES was enhanced by the presence of silicon backing plate directly beneath the TES. Using this arrangement, we were able to apply of electric fields up to 90 kV/m across the TES. We observed no electric field sensitivity at any field strength demonstrating the capability to use TESs in environments of strong electric fields.</p>

<p>2023-05-10, <strong>Neutrino oscillations induced by chiral torsion</strong>, Riya Barick et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05903v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.05903v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino mixing is caused by the fact that neutrino flavors are not eigenstates of the free Hamiltonian. This causes oscillations among different neutrino flavors. When neutrinos pass through a medium, weak interactions produce different effective masses for neutrinos of different flavors, leading to a modification of the mixing parameters. In curved spacetime there is an additional contribution to neutrino Hamiltonian from a torsion-induced four-fermion interaction, which also causes neutrino mixing while propagating through fermionic matter. We provide an outline of the calculation of this effect on neutrino oscillation.</p>

<p>2023-05-11, <strong>Improving constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity using neural network based reconstruction</strong>, Thomas FlÃ¶ss et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07018v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.07018v1</a></p>

<p>We study the use of U-Nets in reconstructing the linear dark matter density field and its consequences for constraining cosmological parameters, in particular primordial non-Gaussianity. Our network is able to reconstruct the initial conditions of redshift $z=0$ density fields from N-body simulations with $90\%$ accuracy out to $k \leq 0.4$ h/Mpc, competitive with state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms at a fraction of the computational cost. We study the information content of the reconstructed $z=0$ density field with a Fisher analysis using the QUIJOTE simulation suite, including non-Gaussian initial conditions. Combining the pre- and post-reconstructed power spectrum and bispectrum data up to $k_{\rm max} = 0.52$ h/Mpc, we find significant improvements on all parameters. Most notably, we find a factor $3.65$ (local), $3.54$ (equilateral) and $2.90$ (orthogonal) improvement on the marginalized errors of $f_{\rm NL}$ as compared to only using the pre-reconstructed data. We show that these improvements can be attributed to a combination of reduced data covariance and parameter degeneracy. The results constitute an important step towards more optimal inference of primordial non-Gaussianity from non-linear scales.</p>

<p>2023-05-10, <strong>How to Flip a Bar</strong>, Angela Collier et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06383v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06383v1</a></p>

<p>Galactic bars, made up of elongated and aligned stellar orbits, can lose angular momentum via resonant torques with dark matter particles in the halo and slow down. Here we show that if a stellar bar is decelerated to zero rotation speed, it can flip the sign of its angular momentum and reverse rotation direction. We demonstrate this in a collisionless N-body simulation of a galaxy in a live counter-rotating halo. Reversal begins at small radii and propagates outward. The flip generates a kinematically-decoupled core both in the visible galaxy and in the dark matter halo, and counter-rotation generates a large-scale warp of the outer disk with respect to the bar.</p>

<p>2023-05-10, <strong>The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). XXXV. First Kinematical Clues of Overly-Massive Dark Matter Halos in Several Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies in the Virgo Cluster</strong>, Elisa Toloba et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06369v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06369v1</a></p>

<p>We present Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of the first complete sample of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the Virgo cluster. We select all UDGs in Virgo that contain at least 10 globular cluster (GC) candidates and are more than $2.5\sigma$ outliers in scaling relations of size, surface brightness, and luminosity (a total of 10 UDGs). We use the radial velocity of their GC satellites to measure the velocity dispersion of each UDG. We find a mixed bag of galaxies: from one UDG that shows no signs of dark matter, to UDGs that follow the luminosity-dispersion relation of early-type galaxies, to the most extreme examples of heavily dark matter dominated galaxies that break well-known scaling relations such as the luminosity-dispersion or the U-shaped total mass-to-light ratio relations. This is indicative of a number of mechanisms at play forming these peculiar galaxies. Some of them may be the most extended version of dwarf galaxies, while others are so extreme that they seem to populate dark matter halos consistent with that of the Milky-Way or even larger. Even though Milky-Way stars and other GC interlopers contaminating our sample of GCs cannot be fully ruled-out, our assessment of this potential problem and simulations indicate that the probability is low and, if present, unlikely to be enough to explain the extreme dispersions measured. Further confirmation from stellar kinematics studies in these UDGs would be desirable. The lack of such extreme objects in any of the state-of-the-art simulations, opens an exciting avenue of new physics shaping these galaxies.</p>

<p>2023-05-10, <strong>Constraints on the Hubble constant from Supernova Refsdalâs reappearance</strong>, Patrick L. Kelly et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06367v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06367v1</a></p>

<p>The gravitationally lensed Supernova Refsdal appeared in multiple images, produced through gravitational lensing by a massive foreground galaxy cluster. After the supernova appeared in 2014, lens models of the galaxy cluster predicted an additional image of the supernova would appear in 2015, which was subsequently observed. We use the time delays between the images to perform a blinded measurement of the expansion rate of the Universe, quantified by the Hubble constant (H0). Using eight cluster lens models, we infer H0 = 64.8 +4.4-4.3 km / s / Mpc, where Mpc is the megaparsec. Using the two models most consistent with the observations, we find H0 = 66.6 +4.1-3.3 km / s / Mpc.

<p>The nature of dark matter is still unknown and an experimental program to look for dark matter particles in our Galaxy should extend its sensitivity to light particles in the GeV mass range and exploit the directional information of the DM particle motion. The CYGNO project is studying a gaseous time projection chamber operated at atmospheric pressure with a Gas Electron Multiplier amplification and with an optical readout as a promising technology for light dark matter and directional searches.   In this paper we describe the operation of a 50 liter prototype named LIME (Long Imaging ModulE) in an overground location at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati of INFN. This prototype employs the technology under study for the 1 cubic meter CYGNO demonstrator to be installed at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. We report the characterization of LIME with photon sources in the energy range from few keV to several tens of keV to understand the performance of the energy reconstruction of the emitted electron. We achieved a low energy threshold of few keV and an energy resolution over the whole energy range of 10-20%, while operating the detector for several weeks continuously with very high operational efficiency. The energy spectrum of the reconstructed electrons is then reported and will be the basis to identify radio-contaminants of the LIME materials to be removed for future CYGNO detectors.</p>

<p>2023-05-11, <strong>Testing the Cosmological Principle: On the Time Dilation of Distant Sources</strong>, Oliver T. Oayda et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06771v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06771v1</a></p>

<p>We present a novel test of the cosmological principle: the idea that, on sufficiently large scales, the universe should appear homogeneous and isotropic to observers comoving with the Hubble flow. This is a fundamental assumption in modern cosmology, underpinning the use of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric as part of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. However, the observed dipole imprinted on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is interpreted as our departure from the Hubble flow, and such a proper motion will induce a directionally-dependent time dilation over the sky. We illustrate the feasibility of detection of this âtime dilation dipoleâ and sketch the practical steps involved in its extraction from a catalogue of sources with intrinsic time-scales. In essence, whilst the scale of this dilation is small, being of order of 0.1%, it will in principle be detectable in large scale surveys of variable cosmological sources, such as quasars and supernovae. The degree of alignment of the time dilation dipole with the kinematic dipole derived from the CMB will provide a new assessment of the cosmological principle, and address the tension in dipole measures from other observations.</p>

<p>Putting constraints on a possible Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) from astrophysical sources such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is an essential tool for finding evidences of new theories of quantum gravity (QG) that predict energy-dependent speed of light. Such a search has its own difficulties, so usually, the effect of the cosmological model is understudied and the default model is a fixed-parameters $\Lambda$CDM. In this work, we use different astrophysical datasets to study the effect of a number of dark energy models on the LIV constrains. To this end, we combine two public time-delay GRB datasets with the supernovae Pantheon dataset, a number of angular baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), the cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance prior and a GRB or quasars dataset. We find for $\alpha$ the expected average value of $\sim 4 \times 10^{-4}$, corresponding to $E_{QG}\ge 10^{17}$ GeV for both time-delay (TD) datasets, with the second one being more sensitive to the cosmological model. We find that the cosmology amounts to at least 20\% deviation in our constraints on the energy. Also interestingly, adding the TD points makes the DE models less-preferable statistically and shifts the value of the parameter $c/(H_0 r_d)$ down, making it smaller than the expected value. We see that possible LIV measurements depend critically on the transparency of the assumptions behind the published data with respect to cosmology and that taking it into account may be important contribution in the case of possible detection.</p>

<p>2023-05-10, <strong>The Magnificent Five Images of Supernova Refsdal: Time Delay and Magnification Measurements</strong>, Patrick L. Kelly et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06377v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06377v1</a></p>

<p>In late 2014, four images of Supernova (SN) âRefsdal,â the first known example of a strongly lensed SN with multiple resolved images, were detected in the MACS J1149 galaxy-cluster field. Following the imagesâ discovery, the SN was predicted to reappear within hundreds of days at a new position ~8 arcseconds away in the field. The observed reappearance in late 2015 makes it possible to carry out Refsdalâs (1964) original proposal to use a multiply imaged SN to measure the Hubble constant H0, since the time delay between appearances should vary inversely with H0. Moreover, the position, brightness, and timing of the reappearance enable a novel test of the blind predictions of galaxy-cluster models, which are typically constrained only by the positions of multiply imaged galaxies. We have developed a new photometry pipeline that uses DOLPHOT to measure the fluxes of the five images of SN Refsdal from difference images. We apply four separate techniques to perform a blind measurement of the relative time delays and magnification ratios (mu_i/mu_1) between the last image SX and the earlier images S1-S4. We measure the relative time delay of SX-S1 to be 376.0+5.6-5.5 days and the relative magnification to be 0.30+0.05-0.03. This corresponds to a 1.5% precision on the time delay and 17% precision for the magnification ratios, and includes uncertainties due to millilensing and microlensing. In an accompanying paper, we place initial and blind constraints on the value of the Hubble constant.</p>

<p>Observations of individual massive stars, super-luminous supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and gravitational-wave events involving spectacular black-hole mergers, indicate that the low-metallicity Universe is fundamentally different from our own Galaxy. Many transient phenomena will remain enigmatic until we achieve a firm understanding of the physics and evolution of massive stars at low metallicity (Z).   The Hubble Space Telescope has devoted 500 orbits to observe 250 massive stars at low Z in the ultraviolet (UV) with the COS and STIS spectrographs under the ULLYSES program.   The complementary ``X-Shooting ULLYSESââ (XShootU) project provides enhanced legacy value with high-quality optical and near-infrared spectra obtained with the wide-wavelength coverage X-shooter spectrograph at ESOâs Very Large Telescope.   We present an overview of the XShootU project, showing that combining ULLYSES UV and XShootU optical spectra is critical for the uniform determination of stellar parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, luminosity, and abundances, as well as wind properties such as mass-loss rates in function of Z. As uncertainties in stellar and wind parameters percolate into many adjacent areas of Astrophysics, the data and modelling of the XShootU project is expected to be a game-changer for our physical understanding of massive stars at low Z.   To be able to confidently interpret James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spectra of the first stellar generations, the individual spectra of low Z stars need to be understood, which is exactly where XShootU can deliver.</p>

<p>2023-05-10, <strong>Constraints on the Hubble constant from Supernova Refsdalâs reappearance</strong>, Patrick L. Kelly et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06367v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06367v1</a></p>

<p>The gravitationally lensed Supernova Refsdal appeared in multiple images, produced through gravitational lensing by a massive foreground galaxy cluster. After the supernova appeared in 2014, lens models of the galaxy cluster predicted an additional image of the supernova would appear in 2015, which was subsequently observed. We use the time delays between the images to perform a blinded measurement of the expansion rate of the Universe, quantified by the Hubble constant (H0). Using eight cluster lens models, we infer H0 = 64.8 +4.4-4.3 km / s / Mpc, where Mpc is the megaparsec. Using the two models most consistent with the observations, we find H0 = 66.6 +4.1-3.3 km / s / Mpc. The observations are best reproduced by models that assign dark-matter halos to individual galaxies and the overall cluster.</p>

<p>2023-05-10, <strong>Jet-powered turbulence in common envelope evolution</strong>, Shlomi Hillel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06266v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.06266v1</a></p>

<p>We conduct a three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of a common envelope evolution (CEE) where a neutron star (NS) spirals-in inside the envelope of a red supergiant (RSG) star in a predetermined orbit. We find that the jets shed pairs of vortices in an expanding spiral pattern, inflate two expanding spirally-shaped low-density bubbles, one above and one below the equatorial plane, and deposit angular momentum to the envelope. In the simulation we do not include the gravity of the NS such that all effects we find are solely due to the jets that the spiralling-in NS launches. The angular momentum that the jets deposit to the envelope is of the same order of magnitude as the orbital angular momentum and has the same direction. The turbulence that the jets induce in the common envelope might play a role in transporting energy and angular momentum. The jet-deposited energy that is radiated away (a process not studied here) leads to a transient event that is termed common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) and might mimic an energetic core collapse supernova. The turbulence and the spiral pattern that we explore here might lead to bumps in the late light curve of the CEJSN when different segments of the ejected envelope collide with each other. This study emphasises the roles that jets can play in CEE (including jets launched by black hole companions) and adds to the rich variety of processes in CEJSN events.</p>

<p>Core-collapse supernova explosions play a wide role in astrophysics by producing compact remnants (neutron stars, black holes) and the synthesis and injection of many heavy elements into their host Galaxy. Because they are produced in some of the most extreme conditions in the universe, they can also probe physics in extreme conditions (matter at nuclear densities and extreme temperatures and magnetic fields). To quantify the impact of supernovae on both fundamental physics and our understanding of the Universe, we must leverage a broad set of observables of this engine. In this paper, we study a subset of these probes using a suite of 1-dimensional, parameterized mixing models: ejecta remnants from supernovae, ultraviolet, optical and infra-red lightcurves, and transient gamma-ray emission. We review the other diagnostics and show how the different probes tie together to provide a more clear picture of the supernova engine.</p>

<p>In MeerKAT observations pointed at a Galactic X-ray binary located on the Galactic plane we serendipitously discovered a radio nebula with cometary-like morphology. The feature, which we named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the Mini Mouse' based on its similarity with the previously discovered </code>Mouseâ nebula, points back towards the previously unidentified candidate supernova remnant G45.24$+$0.18. We observed the location of the Mini Mouse with MeerKAT in two different observations, and we localised with arcsecond precision the 138 ms radio pulsar PSR J1914+1054g, recently discovered by the FAST telescope, to a position consistent with the head of the nebula. We confirm a dispersion measure of about 418 pc cm$^{-3}$ corresponding to a distance between 7.8 and 8.8 kpc based on models of the electron distribution. Using our accurate localisation and 2 period measurements spaced 90 days apart we calculate a period derivative of (2.7 $\pm$ 0.3) $\times$ 10 $^{-14}$ s s$^{-1}$. We derive a characteristic age of approximately 82 kyr and a spin down luminosity of 4$\times$10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively. For a pulsar age comparable with the characteristic age, we find that the projected velocity of the neutron star is between 320 and 360 km/s if it was born at the location of the supernova remnant. The size of the proposed remnant appears small if compared with the pulsar characteristic age, however the relatively high density of the environment near the Galactic plane could explain a suppressed expansion rate and thus a smaller remnant.</p>
