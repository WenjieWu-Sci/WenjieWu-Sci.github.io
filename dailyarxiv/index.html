<p>2023-05-16, <strong>Energy and Angle Dependence of Neutrino Scattering Rates in Proto-Neutron Star and Supernova Matter within Skyrme RPA</strong>, Mingya Duan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09499v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.09499v1</a></p>

<p>Supernova explosions are the most powerful neutrino sources. The neutrino emission is also the dominating cooling mechanism for a proto-neutron star, whose interior is mainly composed of extremely dense and hot nuclear matter. Neutrino transport is an essential part of the simulation of these phenomena, and modern codes are able to implement inelastic neutrino scattering and also to some extent its angle distribution. We therefore study the energy and angle dependence of neutrino scattering rates in proto-neutron star and supernova matter with the full Skyrme RPA response functions. We confirm earlier findings obtained in the Landau approximation that the RPA reduces neutrino scattering, but the detailed differential scattering rates in hot and dense matter depend sensitively on the adopted interaction. The scattering angle distribution is different for different interactions because it depends strongly on the neutron Fermi velocity. We also find that many Skyrme interactions present an unphysical feature that the Fermi velocity of neutrons exceeds the speed of light already at relatively low densities.</p>

<p>2023-05-16, <strong>Observation of collider muon neutrinos with the SND@LHC experiment</strong>, The SND@LHC Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09383v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.09383v1</a></p>

<p>We report the direct observation of muon neutrino interactions with the SND@LHC detector at the Large Hadron Collider. A data set of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6\,$TeV collected by SND@LHC in 2022 is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.8$\,\rm{fb}^{-1}$. The search is based on information from the active electronic components of the SND@LHC detector, which covers the pseudo-rapidity region of $7.2 &lt; \eta &lt; 8.4$, inaccessible to the other experiments at the collider. Muon neutrino candidates are identified through their charged-current interaction topology, with a track propagating through the entire length of the muon detector. After selection cuts, 8 $\nu_\mu$ interaction candidate events remain with an estimated background of 0.076 events, yielding a significance of seven standard deviations for the observed $\nu_\mu$ signal.</p>

<p>2023-05-16, <strong>A minimal inverse seesaw model with $S_4$ flavour symmetry</strong>, Bikash Thapa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09306v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.09306v1</a></p>

<p>We construct an $S_4$ flavour symmetric minimal inverse seesaw model where the standard model is extended by adding two right-handed and two standard model gauge singlets neutrinos to explain the origin of tiny neutrino masses. The resulting model describes the lepton mass spectra and flavour mixing quite well for the case of the normal hierarchy of neutrino masses. The prediction of the model on the Dirac CP-violating phase is centered around $370.087^\circ$. Furthermore, using the allowed region for the model parameters, we have calculated the value of the effective Majorana neutrino mass, $\lvert\langle m_{ee}\rangle\rvert$, which characterizes neutrinoless double beta decay.</p>

<p>2023-05-16, <strong>Compatibility of CE$ν$NS with muon $g-2$, $W$ mass, and $R(D^{(*)})$ in a gauged ${L_μ-L_τ}$ with a scalar LQ</strong>, Chuan-Hung Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09256v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.09256v1</a></p>

<p>Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleon scattering, challenged by the low nucleus recoil energy of a few tens of keV, has been observed by the COHERENT experiment using targets CsI and Ar. We study the contribution of a light $Z’$ mediator in a gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry. In contrast to the mechanism from the kinetic mixing between $U(1)_{\rm em}$ and $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$, we adopt a dynamical symmetry breaking of the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ by employing an extra Higgs doublet. As a result, the weak charge mediated by $Z’$ only depends on the mass of light gauge boson. Since two Goldstone bosons are required to serve as the longitudinal components of $Z$ and $Z’$, the model does not contain a physical CP-odd scalar. Using the introduced Higgs doublet carrying the $U(1)_{\mu-\tau}$ charge, new Higgs decay channels $h\to Z_1 Z_1/Z_1 Z_2$ with percent-level branching fractions become accessible. The $W$-mass anomaly observed by CDF II can be resolved by enhancing the oblique parameter $T$. With the flavored gauge symmetry, the Yukawa couplings to fermion flavors are strictly limited. By utilizing the characteristic and introducing a scalar leptoquark $S^{\frac{1}{3}}=(3,1,2/3)$ that uniquely couples to the $\tau$ lepton, the excesses of $R(D)$ and $R(D^*)$ can be explained. Moreover, $\tau \to \mu (Z_1\to ) e^- e^+$ via the resonant light gauge boson decay can reach the sensitivity of Belle II at an integrated luminosity of 50 ab$^{-1}$.</p>

<p>2023-05-15, <strong>A short survey of matter-antimatter evolution in the primordial universe</strong>, Johann Rafelski et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09055v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.09055v1</a></p>

<p>We offer a survey of the matter-antimatter evolution within the primordial Universe. While the origin of the tiny matter-antimatter asymmetry has remained one of the big questions in modern cosmology, antimatter itself has played a large role for much of the Universe’s early history. In our study of the evolution of the Universe we adopt the position of the standard model $\Lambda$-CDM Universe implementing the known baryonic asymmetry. We present the composition of the Universe across its temperature history while emphasizing the epochs where antimatter content is essential to our understanding. Special topics we address include the heavy quarks in quark-gluon plasma (QGP), the creation of matter from QGP, the free-streaming of the neutrinos, the vanishing of the muons, the magnetism in the electron-positron cosmos, and a better understanding of the environment of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) producing the light elements. We suggest but do not explore further that the methods used in exploring the early Universe may also provide new insights in the study of exotic stellar cores, magnetars, as well as gamma-ray burst (GRB) events. We describe future investigations required in pushing known physics to its extremes in the unique laboratory of the matter-antimatter early Universe.</p>

<p>2023-05-15, <strong>Probing hidden sectors with a muon beam: implication of spin-0 dark matter mediators for muon $(g-2)$ anomaly and validity of the Weiszäcker-Williams approach</strong>, H. Sieber et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09015v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.09015v1</a></p>

<p>In addition to vector ($V$) type new particles extensively discussed previously, both CP-even ($S$) and CP-odd ($P$) spin-0 Dark Matter (DM) mediators can couple to muons and be produced in the bremsstrahlung reaction $\mu^- + N \rightarrow \mu^- + N + S(P)$. Their possible subsequent invisible decay into a pair of Dirac DM particles, $S(P) \to \chi \overline{\chi}$, can be detected in fixed target experiments through missing energy signature. In this paper, we focus on the case of experiments using high-energy muon beams. For this reason, we derive the differential cross-sections involved using the phase space Weisz"acker-Williams approximation and compare them to the exact-tree-level calculations. The formalism derived can be applied in various experiments that could observe muon-spin-0 DM interactions. This can happen in present and future proton beam-dump experiments such as NA62, SHIP, HIKE, and SHADOWS; in muon fixed target experiments as NA64$\mu$, MUoNE and M3; in neutrino experiments using powerful proton beams such as DUNE. In particular, we focus on the NA64$\mu$ experiment case, which uses a 160 GeV muon beam at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron accelerator. We compute the derived cross-sections, the resulting signal yields and we discuss the experiment projected sensitivity to probe the relic DM parameter space and the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly favoured region considering $10^{12}$ and $10^{13}$ muons on target.</p>

<p>2023-05-15, <strong>Leptonic CP violation from the seesaw</strong>, C. C. Nishi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08980v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.08980v1</a></p>

<p>The seesaw extension of the SM explains the tiny neutrino masses and it is accompanied by many CP violating phases. We study the case where all leptonic CP violation arises from the soft breaking in the heavy Majorana mass matrix. Parameter counting reveals that one less parameter is needed to describe this case. This reduction leads to restrictions on the parameter space of heavy neutrinos. We analyze the minimal seesaw case in detail and find that mass degeneracy of heavy neutrinos are not possible for certain values of the CP phases.</p>

<p>2023-05-15, <strong>Neutrino Mass Model in the Context of $\boldsymbol{Δ(54) \otimes Z_2\otimes Z_3 \otimes Z_4}$ Flavor Symmetries with Inverse Seesaw Mechanism</strong>, Hrishi Bora et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08963v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.08963v1</a></p>

<p>Our analysis involves enhancing the $\Delta(54)$ flavor symmetry model with Inverse Seesaw mechanism along with two SM Higgs through the incorporation of distinct flavons. Additionally, we introduce supplementary $Z_2\otimes Z_3 \otimes Z_4$ symmetries to eliminate any undesirable components within our investigation. The exact tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern undergoes a deviation as a result of the incorporation of extra flavons, leading to the emergence of a non-zero reactor angle $\theta_{13}$ that aligns with the latest experimental findings. It was found that for our model the atmospheric oscillation parameter occupies the lower octant for normal hierarchy case. We also examine the parameter space of the model for normal hierarchy to explore the Dirac CP ($\delta_{CP}$), Jarlskog invariant parameter ($J$) and the Neutrinoless double-beta decay parameter ($m_{\beta\beta}$) and found it in agreement with the neutrino latest data. Hence our model may be testable in the future neutrino experiments.</p>

<p>2023-05-15, <strong>Neutron star kicks and implications for their rotation at birth</strong>, Giacomo Fragione et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08920v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.08920v1</a></p>

<p>Neutron stars are born out of core-collapse supernovae, and they are imparted natal kicks at birth as a consequence of asymmetric ejection of matter and possibly neutrinos. Unless the force resulting from the kicks is exerted exactly at their center, it will also cause the neutron star to rotate. In this paper, we discuss the possibility that neutron stars may receive off-center natal kicks at birth, which imprint a natal rotation. In this scenario, the observed pulsar spin and transverse velocity in the Galaxy are expected to correlate. We develop a model of the natal rotation imparted to neutron stars and constrain it by the observed population of pulsars in our Galaxy. At $90\%$ confidence, we find that the location of the off-center kick is $R_{\rm kick}=1.12^{+4.79}_{-0.97}$\,km. Our result is robust when considering pulsars with different observed periods, transverse velocities, and ages. Our constraint can be used as a guide for core-collapse simulations of massive stars.</p>

<p>2023-05-15, <strong>First operation of an ALICE OROC operated in high pressure Ar-CO$<em>{2}$ and Ar-CH$</em>{4}$</strong>, A. Ritchie-Yates et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08822v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.08822v1</a></p>

<p>New neutrino-nucleus interaction cross-section measurements are required to improve nuclear models sufficiently for future long-baseline neutrino experiments to meet their sensitivity goals. A time projection chamber (TPC) filled with a high-pressure gas is a promising detector to characterise the neutrino sources planned for such experiments. A gas-filled TPC is ideal for measuring low-energy particles as they travel much further in gas than solid or liquid neutrino detectors. Using a high-pressure gas increases the target density, resulting in more neutrino interactions. This paper will examine the suitability of multiwire proportional chambers (MWPCs) taken from the ALICE TPC to be used as the readout chambers of a high-pressure gas TPC. These chambers were previously operated at atmospheric pressure. We tested one such MWPC at up to almost 5 bar absolute (barA) with the UK high-pressure test stand at Royal Holloway, University of London. This paper reports the successful operation of an ALICE TPC outer readout chamber (OROC) at pressures up to 4.8 bar absolute with Ar-CH$_{4}$ mixtures with a CH$_{4}$ content between 2.8% and 5.0%, and so far up to 4 bar absolute with Ar-CO$_{2}$ (90-10). We measured the charge gain of this OROC using signals induced by an $^{55}$Fe source. The largest gain achieved at 4.8 bar was $64\pm2)\cdot10^{3}$ at stable conditions with an anode wire voltage of 2990 V in Ar-CH$_{4}$ (95.9-4.1). In Ar-CO$_{2}$ a gain of $(4.2\pm0.1)\cdot10^{3}$ was observed at an anode voltage of 2975 V at 4 barA gas pressure. Based on all our gain measurements, we extrapolate that, at the 10 barA pressure necessary to fit 1 tonne of gas into the ALICE TPC volume, a gain of 5000 in Ar-CO$_{2}$ (90-10) (10000 in Ar-CH$_{4}$ with $\sim!$ 4% CH$_{4}$ content) may be achieved with an OROC anode voltage of 4.2 V ($\sim!$ 3.1 kV).</p>

<p>2023-05-15, <strong>Exploring the Focusing Mechanism of the NuMI Horn Magnets</strong>, Katsuya Yonehara et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08695v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.08695v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) is a project at Fermilab that provides an intense beam of neutrinos used by a number of experiments. NuMI creates a beam of pions that decay into neutrinos, muons, and other particles. Muons are registered by the muon monitors. Magnetic horns are the key elements of the NuMI beam line. This paper uses the muon beam profile observed at the muon monitors to study the NuMI horn focusing mechanism. It is found that the horn magnet generates dipole and quadrupole fields to focus pions. This suggests that the optics of the horn magnet are predominantly linear. Our study shows that the muon beam profile accurately detects the horn current within 0.05%.</p>

<p>2023-05-15, <strong>First Physics Results from the FASER Experiment</strong>, Brian Petersen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08665v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.08665v1</a></p>

<p>FASER is a new LHC experiment designed to search for light, weakly-interacting particles that are produced in proton-proton collisions at the ATLAS interaction point and travel in the far-forward direction. The first physics results from the initial year of data-taking are presented. A search for dark photons decaying to an electron-positron pair found no events, yielding new constraints on dark photons with couplings $\epsilon \sim 10^{-5} - 10^{-4}$ and masses $\sim 10$ MeV $- 100$ MeV. A search for muon-neutrino charged-current interactions in a tungsten target at the front of the FASER experiment found $153^{+12}_{-13}$ neutrino candidates with a negligible background. The reconstructed charge and momentum distributions imply the observation of both neutrinos and anti-neutrinos with an incident neutrino energy above 200 GeV.</p>

<p>2023-05-15, <strong>Short Baseline Oscillations and the Gallium Mystery</strong>, Vedran Brdar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08627v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.08627v1</a></p>

<p>Data from several neutrino experiments suggest an anomalous neutrino flavor transition across relatively short baselines which is in conflict with the three-flavor neutrino oscillation paradigm. In particular, MiniBooNE and BEST collaborations have reported anomalous findings at $\sim 5\sigma$. In this contribution, such measurements and their possible explanations within and beyond the Standard Model are discussed.</p>

<p>2023-05-15, <strong>Precision cosmology with the 21-cm signal from the dark ages</strong>, Rajesh Mondal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08593v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.08593v1</a></p>

<p>The 21-cm signal from the dark ages provides a potential new probe of fundamental cosmology. While exotic physics could be discovered, here we quantify the expected benefits within the standard cosmology. A measurement of the global (sky-averaged) 21-cm signal to the precision of thermal noise from a 1,000 hour integration would yield a $5.5\%$ measurement of a combination of cosmological parameters. A 10,000 hour integration would improve this to $1.8\%$, and constrain the cosmic Helium fraction as well as Planck. Precision cosmology with 21-cm fluctuations requires a collecting area of $10\,{\rm km}^2$ (which corresponds to 400,000 stations), which with a 1,000 hour integration would exceed the same global case. Enhancing the collecting area or integration time $\times$10 would yield a $0.5\%$ parameter combination, a Helium measurement five times better than Planck, and a constraint on the neutrino mass as good as Planck. Our analysis sets a baseline for upcoming lunar and space-based dark ages experiments.</p>

<p>2023-05-15, <strong>Exploring Models with Modular Symmetry in Neutrino Oscillation Experiments</strong>, Priya Mishra et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08576v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.08576v1</a></p>

<p>Our study aims to investigate the viability of neutrino mass models that arise from discrete non-Abelian modular symmetry groups, i.e., $\Gamma_N$ with ($N=1,2,3,\dots$) in the future neutrino experiments T2HK, DUNE, and JUNO. Modular symmetry reduces the usage of flavon fields compared to the conventional discrete flavor symmetry models. Theories based on modular symmetries predict the values of leptonic mixing parameters, and therefore, these models can be tested in future neutrino experiments. In this study, we consider three models based on the $A_4$ modular symmetry, i.e., Model-A, B, and C such a way that they predict different values of the oscillation parameters but still allowed with respect to the current data. In the future, it is expected that T2HK, DUNE, and JUNO will measure the neutrino oscillation parameters very precisely, and therefore, some of these models can be excluded in the future by these experiments. We have estimated the prediction of these models numerically and then used them as input to scrutinize these models in the neutrino experiments. Assuming the future best-fit values of $\theta_{23}$ and $\delta_{\rm CP}$ remain the same as the current one, our results show that at $5 \sigma$ C.L, Model-A can be excluded by T2HK whereas Model-B can be excluded by both T2HK and DUNE. Model-C cannot be excluded by T2HK and DUNE at $5 \sigma$ C.L. Further; our results show that JUNO alone can exclude Model-B at an extremely high confidence level if the future best-fit of $\theta_{12}$ remains at the current-one. We have also identified the region in the $\theta_{23}$ - $\delta_{\rm CP}$ parameter space, for which Model-A cannot be separated from Model-B in T2HK and DUNE.</p>

<p>2023-05-16, <strong>Probing $z \gtrsim 6$ massive black holes with gravitational waves</strong>, Srija Chakraborty et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09362v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.09362v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the coalescence of massive black hole ($M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim 10^{6}~\rm M_{\odot}$) binaries (MBHBs) at $6&lt;z&lt;10$ by adopting a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, zoomed-in on biased ($ &gt;3 \sigma$) overdense regions ($M_h\sim 10^{12}~\rm M_{\odot}$ dark matter halos at $z = 6$) of the Universe. We first analyse the impact of different resolutions and AGN feedback prescriptions on the merger rate, assuming instantaneous mergers. Then, we compute the halo bias correction factor due to the overdense simulated region. Our simulations predict merger rates that range between 3 - 15 $\rm yr^{-1}$ at $z\sim 6$, depending on the run considered, and after correcting for a bias factor of $\sim 20-30$.   For our fiducial model, we further consider the effect of delay in the MBHB coalescence due to dynamical friction. We find that 83 per cent of MBHBs will merge within the Hubble time, and 21 per cent within 1 Gyr, namely the age of the Universe at $z &gt; 6$. We finally compute the expected properties of the gravitational wave (GW) signals and find the fraction of LISA detectable events with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR $&gt;$ 5) to range between 66-69 per cent. However, identifying the electro-magnetic counterpart of these events remains challenging due to the poor LISA sky localization that, for the loudest signals ($\mathcal M_c\sim 10^6~\rm M_{\odot}$ at $z=6$), is around 10 $\rm deg^2$.</p>

<p>2023-05-16, <strong>Optimizing the Evolution of Perturbations in the $Λ$CDM Universe</strong>, Nicholas Choustikov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09337v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.09337v1</a></p>

<p>Perturbation theory is a powerful tool for studying large-scale structure formation in the universe and calculating observables such as the power spectrum or bispectrum. However, beyond linear order, typically this is done by assuming a simplification in the time-dependence of gravitational-coupling kernels between the matter and velocity fluctuations. Though the true dependencies are known for Lambda cold dark matter cosmologies, they are ignored due to the computational costs associated with considering them in full and, instead, are replaced by simpler dependencies valid for an Einstein–de-Sitter cosmology. Here we develop, implement and demonstrate the effectiveness of a new numerical method for finding the full dynamical evolution of these kernels to all perturbative orders based upon spectral methods using Chebyshev polynomials. This method is found to be orders of magnitude more efficient than direct numerical solvers while still producing highly accurate and reliable results. A code implementation of the Chebyshev spectral method is then presented and characterised. The code has been made publicly available alongside this paper. We expect our method to be of use for interpretation of upcoming galaxy clustering measurements.</p>

<p>2023-05-16, <strong>Axion-like particle (ALP) portal freeze-in dark matter confronting ALP search experiments</strong>, Dilip Kumar Ghosh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09188v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.09188v1</a></p>

<p>The relic density of Dark Matter (DM) in the freeze-in scenario is highly dependent on the evolution history of the universe and changes significantly in a non-standard (NS) cosmological framework prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). In this scenario, an additional species dominates the energy budget of the universe at early times (before BBN), resulting in a larger cosmological expansion rate at a given temperature compared to the standard radiation-dominated (RD) universe. To investigate the production of DM in the freeze-in scenario, we consider both standard RD and NS cosmological picture before BBN and perform a comparative analysis. We extend the Standard Model (SM) particle content with a SM singlet DM particle $\chi $ and an axion-like particle (ALP) $a$. The interactions between ALP, SM particles, and DM are generated by higher dimensional effective operators. This setup allows the production of DM $\chi$ from SM bath through the mediation of ALP, via ALP-portal processes. These interactions involve non-renormalizable operators, leading to ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in, which depends on the reheating temperature ($T_{RH}$) of the early universe. In the NS cosmological scenario, the faster expansion rate suppresses the DM production processes, allowing for enhanced effective couplings between the visible and dark sectors to satisfy the observed DM abundance compared to RD scenario. This improved coupling increases the detection prospects for freeze-in DM via the ALP-portal, which is otherwise challenging to detect in RD universe due to small couplings involved. Using an effective field theory set-up, we show that various ALP searches such as in FASER, DUNE, and SHiP, etc. will be able to probe significant parameter space depending on the different model parameters.</p>

<p>2023-05-15, <strong>The uncertainties on the EFT coupling limits for direct dark matter detection experiments stemming from uncertainties of target properties</strong>, Daniel J. Heimsoth et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08991v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.08991v1</a></p>

<p>Direct detection experiments are still one of the most promising ways to unravel the nature of dark matter. To fully understand how well these experiments constrain the dark matter interactions with the Standard Model particles, all the uncertainties affecting the calculations must be known. It is especially critical now because direct detection experiments recently moved from placing limits only on the two elementary spin independent and spin dependent operators to the complete set of possible operators coupling dark matter and nuclei in non-relativistic theory. In our work, we estimate the effect of nuclear configuration-interaction uncertainties on the exclusion bounds for one of the existing xenon-based experiments for all fifteen operators. We find that for operator number 13 the $\pm1\sigma$ uncertainty on the coupling between the dark matter and nucleon can reach more than 50% for dark matter masses between 10 and 1000 GeV. In addition, we discuss how quantum computers can help to reduce this uncertainty.</p>

<p>Cosmology and astrophysics provide various ways to study the properties of dark matter even if they have negligible non-gravitational interactions with the Standard Model particles and remain hidden. We study a type of hidden dark matter model in which the dark matter is completely decoupled from the Standard Model sector except gravitationally, and consists of a single species with a conserved comoving particle number. This category of hidden dark matter includes models that act as warm dark matter but is more general. In particular, in addition to having an independent temperature from the Standard Model sector, it includes cases in which dark matter is in its own thermal equilibrium or is free-streaming, obeys fermionic or bosonic statistics, and processes a chemical potential that controls the particle occupation number. While the usual parameterization using the free-streaming scale or the particle mass no longer applies, we show that all cases can be well approximated by a set of functions parameterized by only one parameter as long as the chemical potential is nonpositive: the characteristic scale factor at the time of the relativistic-to-nonrelativistic transition. We study the constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, and the smallest halo mass. We show that the most significant phenomenological impact is the suppression of the small-scale matter power spectrum – a typical feature when the dark matter has a velocity dispersion or pressure at early times. So far, small dark matter halos provide the strongest constraint, limiting the transition scale factor to be no larger than $\sim1.4\times10^{-4}$ times the scale factor at matter-radiation equality.</p>

<p>2023-05-15, <strong>Cold New Early Dark Energy pulls the trigger on the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions: a simultaneous solution to both tensions without new ingredients</strong>, Juan S. Cruz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08895v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.08895v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we show that the Cold New Early Dark Energy (Cold NEDE) model in its original form can solve both the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ tension without adding any new ingredients at the fundamental level. So far, it was assumed that the trigger field in the Cold NEDE model is completely subdominant. However, relaxing this assumption and letting the trigger field contribute a mere $0.5\%$ of the total energy density leads to a resolution of the $S_8$ tension while simultaneously improving it as a solution to the $H_0$ tension. Fitting this model to baryonic acoustic oscillations, large-scale-structure, supernovae (including a SH0ES prior), and cosmic microwave background data, we report a preferred NEDE fraction of $f_\mathrm{NEDE}= 0.134^{+0.032}_{-0.025}$ ($68\%$ C.L.), lifting its Gaussian evidence for the first time above $5\sigma$ (up from $4 \sigma$ when the trigger contribution to dark matter is negligible). At the same time, we find the new concordance values $H_0 = 71.71 \pm 0.88 \,\mathrm{km}\, \mathrm{sec}^{-1}\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $S_8 = 0.793 \pm 0.018$. Excluding large-scale structure data and the SH$_0$ES prior, both Gaussian tensions are reduced below the $2 \sigma$ level.</p>

<p>We investigate the properties of dark energy halos in models with a nonminimal coupling in the dark sector. We show, using a quasistatic approximation, that a coupling of the mass of dark matter particles to a standard quintessence scalar field $\phi$ generally leads to the formation of dark energy concentrations in and around compact dark matter objects. These are associated with regions where scalar field gradients are large and the dark energy equation of state parameter is close to $-1/3$. We find that the energy and radius of a dark energy halo are approximately given by $E_{\rm halo} \sim \boldsymbol{\beta}^2 \varphi \, m$ and $r_{\rm halo} \sim \sqrt{\boldsymbol{\beta} \,\varphi ({R}/{H})}$, where $\varphi=Gm/(R c^2)$, $m$ and $R$ are, respectively, the mass and radius of the associated dark matter object, $\boldsymbol{\beta} = -d \ln m/d \phi$ is the nonminimal coupling strength parameter, $H$ is the Hubble parameter, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. We further show that current observational limits on $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ over a wide redshift range lead to stringent constraints on $E_{\rm halo}/m$ and, therefore, on the impact of dark energy halos on the value of the dark energy equation of state parameter. We also briefly comment on potential backreaction effects that may be associated with the breakdown of the quasistatic approximation and determine the regions of parameter space where such a breakdown might be expected to occur.</p>

<p>The Positron Annihilation to Dark Matter Experiment (PADME) was designed and constructed to search for dark photons ($A’$) in the process $e^+e^-\rightarrow\gamma A’$, using the positron beam at the Beam Test Facility (BTF) at the National Laboratories of Frascati (LNF).

<p>In this work, we study the $SU(2)_L$ singlet complex scalar extended KSVZ model that, in addition to providing a natural solution to the strong-CP problem by including a global Peccei-Quinn symmetry, also furnishes two components of dark matter that satisfy observer relic density without fine-tuning of model parameters. Furthermore, this model provides a rich phenomenology by introducing a vector-like quark whose presence can be sensed in collider experiments and dark matter production mechanisms. We explore the possibility of democratic Yukawa interaction of the vector-like quark with all up-type quarks and scalar dark matter candidate. We also employ next-to-leading order NLO-QCD correction for VLQ pair production to study a unique search at the LHC, generating a pair of boosted tops with sizeable missing transverse momentum. Multivariate analysis with jet substructure variables has a strong ability to explore a significant parameter space of this model at the 14 TeV LHC.</p>

<p>We show how the Gambier equation arises in connection to Friedmann-Lema$\mbox{\^{i}}$tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology and a Dark Matter equation of state. Moreover, we provide a correspondence between the Friedmann equations and the Gambier equations that possess the Painlev$\acute{\mbox{e}}$ property in $2+1$ dimensions. We also consider special cases of the Gambier G27 equation such as the generalized Pinney equation. For an extended FLRW model with dynamic scalar field as matter model, the Einstein equations correspond to the Milne-Pinney equation which in turn can be mapped to the parametric Gambier equation of second order.</p>

<p>We have conducted photometric and spectroscopic observations of the peculiar Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2016ije that was discovered through the Tsinghua-NAOC Transient Survey. This peculiar object exploded in the outskirts of a metal-poor, low-surface brightness galaxy (i.e., $M_{g}$ = $-$14.5 mag). Our photometric analysis reveals that SN~2016ije is subluminous ($M_{B,\rm{max}}$ = $-$17.65$\pm$0.06 mag) but exhibits relatively broad light curves (${\Delta}m_{15}(B)$ = 1.35$\pm$0.14 mag), similar to the behavior of SN~2002es. Our analysis of the bolometric light curve indicates that only 0.14$\pm$0.04 $M_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni was synthesized in the explosion of SN~2016ije, which suggests a less energetic thermonuclear explosion when compared to normal SNe~Ia, and this left a considerable amount of unburned materials in the ejecta. Spectroscopically, SN~2016ije resembles other SN~2002es-like SNe~Ia, except that the ejecta velocity inferred from its carbon absorption line ($\sim$ 4500~km~s$^{-1}$) is much lower than that from silicon lines ($\sim$ 8300~km~s$^{-1}$) at around the maximum light. Additionally, most of the absorption lines are broader than other 02es-like SNe Ia. These peculiarities suggest the presence of significant unburned carbon in the inner region and a wide line-forming region along the line of sight. These characteristics suggest that SN 2016ije might originate from the violent merger of a white dwarf binary system, when viewed near an orientation along the iron-group-element cavity caused by the companion star.</p>

<p>The majority of all stars are members of a binary system. The evolution of such binary stars and their subsequent production of pairs of compact objects in tight orbits, such as double neutron stars and double black holes, play a central role in modern astrophysics, Binary evolution leads to the formation of different types of violent cosmic events such as novae, supernova explosions, gamma-ray bursts, mass transfer and accretion processes in X-ray binaries, and the formation of exotic radio millisecond pulsars. In some cases, the binary systems terminate as spectacular collisions between neutron stars and/or black holes. These collisions lead to powerful emission of gravitational waves, as detected by LIGO since 2015. The coming decade is expected to reveal a large number of discoveries of binary compact systems, as well as their progenitors and merger remnants, from major instruments such as the radio Square-Kilometre Array; the gravitational wave observatories LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA-IndIGO and LISA; the astrometric space observatory Gaia; the James Webb Space Telescope; and the X-ray space observatories eXTP, STROBE-X, and Athena. In this light, it is important to have a modern textbook on the physics of binary stars evolution, from ordinary stars to X-ray binaries and gravitational wave sources. The scope of this book is that the reader (student or educated expert) will learn the physics of binary interactions, from stellar birth to compact objects, and relate this knowledge to the latest observations. The reader will learn about stellar structure and evolution, and detailed binary interactions covering a broad range of phenomena, including mass transfer and orbital evolution, formation and accretion onto compact objects (white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes), and their observational properties. Exercises are provided throughout the book.</p>

<p>2023-05-15, <strong>Modelling supernova nebular lines in 3D with $\texttt{ExTraSS}$</strong>, Bart van Baal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08933v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.08933v1</a></p>

<p>We present $\texttt{ExTraSS}$ (EXplosive TRAnsient Spectral Simulator), a newly developed code aimed at generating 3D spectra for supernovae in the nebular phase by using modern multi-dimensional explosion models as input. It is well established that supernovae are asymmetric by nature, and that the morphology is encoded in the line profiles during the nebular phase, months after the explosion. In this work, we use $\texttt{ExTraSS}$ to study one such simulation of a $3.3\,M_\odot$ He-core explosion ($M_\text{ejecta}=1.3\,M_\odot$, $E_\text{kin}=1.05\times10^{51}\,$erg) modelled with the $\texttt{Prometheus-HotB}$ code and evolved to the homologous phase. Our code calculates the energy deposition from the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni $\rightarrow$ $^{56}$Co $\rightarrow$ $^{56}$Fe and uses this to determine the Non-Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium temperature, excitation and ionization structure across the nebula. From the physical condition solutions we generate the emissivities to construct spectra depending on viewing angles. Our results show large variations in the line profiles with viewing angles, as diagnosed by the first three moments of the line profiles; shifts, widths, and skewness. We compare line profiles from different elements, and study the morphology of line-of-sight slices that determine the flux at each part of a line profile. We find that excitation conditions can sometimes make the momentum vector of the ejecta emitting in the excited states significantly different from that of the bulk of the ejecta of the respective element, thus giving blueshifted lines for bulk receding material, and vice versa. We compare the 3.3 $M_\odot$ He-core model to observations of the Type Ib supernova SN 2007Y.</p>

<p>Substantial effort has been devoted to the characterization of transient phenomena from photometric information. Automated approaches to this problem have taken advantage of complete phase-coverage of an event, limiting their use for triggering rapid follow-up of ongoing phenomena. In this work, we introduce a neural network with a single recurrent layer designed explicitly for early photometric classification of supernovae. Our algorithm leverages transfer learning to account for model misspecification, host galaxy photometry to solve the data scarcity problem soon after discovery, and a custom weighted loss to prioritize accurate early classification. We first train our algorithm using state-of-the-art transient and host galaxy simulations, then adapt its weights and validate it on the spectroscopically-confirmed SNe~Ia, SNe~II, and SNe~Ib/c from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey. On observed data, our method achieves an overall accuracy of $82 \pm 2$% within 3 days of an event’s discovery, and an accuracy of $87 \pm 5$% within 30 days of discovery. At both early and late phases, our method achieves comparable or superior results to the leading classification algorithms with a simpler network architecture. These results help pave the way for rapid photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of scientifically-valuable transients discovered in massive synoptic surveys.</p>

<p>We study how future Type-Ia supernovae (SNIa) standard candles detected by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST) can constrain some cosmological models. We use a realistic three-year SNIa simulated dataset generated by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) Time Domain pipeline, which includes a mix of spectroscopic and photometrically identified candidates. We combine this data with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements to estimate the dark energy model parameters for two models – the baseline $\Lambda$CDM and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) dark energy parametrization. We compare them with the current constraints obtained from joint analysis of the latest real data from the Pantheon SNIa compilation, CMB from Planck 2018 and BAO. Our analysis finds tighter constraints on the model parameters along with a significant reduction of correlation between $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$. We find that LSST is expected to significantly improve upon the existing SNIa data in the critical analysis of cosmological models.</p>

<p>2023-05-15, <strong>The X-ray binaries in M83: will any of them form gravitational wave sources for LIGO/VIRGO/KAGRA?</strong>, Iwona Kotko et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08640v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.08640v1</a></p>

<p>There are 214 X-ray point-sources ($L_{\rm X}&gt;10^{35} \mathrm{erg/s}$) identified as X-ray binaries (XRBs) in the nearby spiral galaxy M83. Since XRBs are powered by accretion onto a neutron star or a black hole from a companion/donor star these systems are promising progenitors of merging double compact objects (DCOs): black hole - black hole (BH-BH), black hole - neutron star (BH-NS), or neutron star - neutron star (NS-NS) systems. The connection (i.e. XRBs evolving into DCOs) may provide some hints to the yet unanswered question: what is the origin of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA mergers? Available observations do not allow to determine what will be the final fate of the XRBs observed in M83. Yet, we can use evolutionary model of isolated binaries to reproduce the population of XRBs in M83 by matching model XRBs numbers/types/luminosities to observations. Knowing the detailed properties of M83 model XRBs (donor/accretor masses, their evolutionary ages and orbits) we follow their evolution to the death of donor stars to check whether any merging DCOs are formed. Although all merging DCOs in our isolated binary evolution model go through the XRB phase (defined as reaching X-ray luminosity from RLOF/wind accretion onto NS/BH above $10^{35}$ erg/s), only very few XRBs evolve to form merging (in Hubble time) DCOs. For M83 with its solar-like metallicity stars and continiuous star-formation we find that only $\sim 1-2\%$ of model XRBs evolve into merging DCOs depending on the adopted evolutionary physics. This is caused by (i) merger of donor star with compact object during common envelope phase, (ii) binary disruption at the supernova explosion of donor star, (iii) formation of a DCO on a wide orbit (merger time longer than Hubble time).</p>

<p>2023-05-15, <strong>Fission and fusion of heavy nuclei induced by the passage of a radiation-mediated shock in BNS mergers</strong>, Alon Granot et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08575v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.08575v1</a></p>

<p>We compute the structure of a Newtonian, multi-ion radiation-mediated shock for different compositions anticipated in various stellar explosions, including supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and binary neutron star mergers, using a multi-fluid RMS model that incorporates a self-consistent treatment of electrostatic coupling between the different plasma constituents. We find a significant velocity separation between ions having different charge-to-mass ratios in the immediate shock downstream and demonstrate that in fast enough shocks ion-ion collisions can trigger fusion and fission events at a relatively large rate. Our analysis does not take into account potential kinetic effects, specifically, anomalous coupling through plasma microturbulence, that can significantly reduce the velocity spread downstream, below the activation energy for nuclear reactions. A rough estimate of the scale separation in RMS suggests that for shocks propagating in BNS merger ejecta, the anomalous coupling length may exceed the radiation length, allowing a considerable composition change behind the shock via inelastic collisions of $\alpha$ particles with heavy elements at shock velocities $\beta_u\gtrsim0.2$. Moreover, a sufficient abundance of free neutrons upstream of the shock can also trigger fission through neutron capture reactions downstream. The resultant change in the composition profile may affect the properties of the early kilonova emission. The implications for other exploding systems are also briefly discussed.</p>
