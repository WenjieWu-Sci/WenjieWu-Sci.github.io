<p>2025-04-15, <strong>The morphology of supernova remnant G0.9+0.1 implies explosion by jittering-jets</strong>, Noam Soker et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11384v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.11384v1</a></p>

<p>I examine the morphology of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (SNR) G0.9+0.1 and reveal a point-symmetrical morphology that implies shaping by three or more pairs of jets, as expected in the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The large northwest protrusion, the ear (or lobe), has two bright rims. I compare this ear with its rims to an ear with three rims of a jet-shaped planetary nebula and jets from an active galactic nucleus that shaped several rims on one side. Based on this similarity, I argue that two jets or more shaped the northwest ear of SNR G0.9+0.1 and its two rims. I identified the bright region south of the main shell of SNR G0.9+0.1 as a jet-shaped blowout formed by a jet that broke out from the main SNR shell. I base this on the similarity of the blowout of SNR G0.9+0.1 with that of SNR G309.2-00.6, argued in the past to be shaped by jets. I identify four symmetry axes along different directions that compose the point-symmetric morphology of SNR G0.9+0.1. I show that the morphological features of holes, granular texture, and random filaments exist in CCSNe and planetary nebulae and are unlikely to result from some unique processes in CCSNe. These structures result from similar instabilities in the JJEM and the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism and, unlike a point-symmetric morphology, cannot determine the explosion mechanism. Identifying SNR G0.9+0.1 as a new point-symmetric CCSN strengthens the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</p>

<p>2025-04-15, <strong>Constraints from muon $g-2$ on a gauged non-universal $U(1)_{X}$ model with inverse see-saw neutrinos</strong>, J. S. Alvarado et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11332v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.11332v1</a></p>

<p>We study the effects on a non-universal $U(1)_{X}$ extension of the Standard Model given the alternative value obtained by the Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal (BMW) group for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $g-2$. The model explains the fermion mass hierarchy through the non-universality of the extra gauge symmetry and by an additional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ discrete symmetry, where the heaviest fermions acquire their masses from two different scales determined by two Higgs doublets and one singlet, whereas the lightest fermions obtain their masses from radiative corrections. From cancellation of chiral anomalies, the model also includes heavy extra fermions, both charged and neutral. The latter are right-handed neutrinos that acquire masses via an inverse see-saw mechanism, reproducing the observed squared mass differences for the active neutrinos. Using the latest lattice calculation of the leading hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, we compute the dominant one-loop diagrams mediated by the $W$ and charged Higgs bosons, both with a heavy Majorana neutrino in the loop, setting bounds for masses of the new particles. We also provide predictions for observables that can probe our model in the future such as charged lepton flavor violating searches at Belle II like $\tau\to \mu\gamma$, $\tau\to e\gamma$ and at MEG II for $\mu\to e\gamma$.</p>

<p>2025-04-15, <strong>The Gaseous Prototype (GaP): a GanESS demonstrator</strong>, L. Larizgoitia et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11324v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.11324v1</a></p>

<p>The GanESS experiment will exploit the high-pressure noble gas time projection chamber technology to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) at the European Spallation Source (ESS). The detector, able to operate at pressures up to 50 bar with different noble gases (Xe, Ar and Kr), will employ electroluminescence to amplify the ionization signal with the objective of reaching a threshold as low as 1-2 e$^-$, equivalent to $&lt;$ 100 eV$_{\text{ee}}$. The Gaseous Prototype (GaP) has been built to characterize the technique at the few-keV energy regime and to understand various aspects related to the technology. Concretely, it will be used to measure the quenching factor of the different mediums as well as to characterize the electroluminescence yield and detection threshold under different operational conditions. The present paper describes the Gaseous Prototype and its first results operating with gaseous argon at moderate pressures (up to 10 bar). A potential detection threshold lower than 2.9 keV has been observed following operation with a $^{55}$Fe calibration source.</p>

<p>2025-04-15, <strong>Role of Matter Inhomogeneity on Fast Flavor Conversion of Supernova Neutrinos</strong>, Soumya Bhattacharyya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11316v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.11316v1</a></p>

<p>We investigated the impact of a spatially varying matter potential $\lambda$, coming from neutrino-electron forward scattering, on the emergence of fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC) triggered by the presence of zero crossings in the angular distribution of the neutrino electron lepton number (ELN). We find that FFC can be significantly affected as the spatial variation rate of $\lambda$ increases, and strong spatial variations can completely stabilize initially unstable systems. Using stability analysis based solely on initial conditions, we identified for the first time a critical variation rate above which no FFC occurs even if the flavor instability exists. By analyzing several representative matter profiles based on an 18 $M_{\odot}$ SN model, we show that spatially inhomogeneous $\lambda$ can suppress the occurrence of FFC associated with shallow ELN zero crossings in most of the SNâs radial region, especially during the accretion phase. Our finding highlights the need to consider the impact of matter inhomogeneity in the development of improved SN models that aim to include the effect of neutrino flavor conversions.</p>

<p>2025-04-15, <strong>Origin of Reactor Antineutrino Anomaly</strong>, L. M. Slad et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11102v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.11102v1</a></p>

<p>The reactor antineutrino anomaly, discovered in 2011, means a noticeable difference between the observed rate of inverse beta decays and the expected (theoretical) rate of such processes based on the measurement of the spectra of electrons in beta decay of $^{235}$U, $^{239}$Pu, $^{241}$Pu, and $^{238}$U nuclei and their subsequent conversion into right-handed antineutrino spectra. This paper provides a rationale for the fact that both right-handed and left-handed antineutrinos are produced in beta decays of nuclei. But the conversion procedure in any case assigns a right-handed antineutrino to each electron, which leads to the superiority of the theoretical rate of inverse beta decays over the experimental one. The right-handed antineutrino is produced in the mode of beta decay of the nucleus due to the standard electroweak interaction. The left-handed antineutrino appears in the mode caused by the existence of a interaction, the carrier of which is a massless pseudoscalar boson having a Yukawa coupling with the electron neutrino and nucleons. The emission of such a boson from a virtual right-handed antineutrino converts it into a free left-handed antineutrino.</p>

<p>2025-04-15, <strong>Cosmic-Ray Constraints on the Flux of Ultra-High-Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A</strong>, Saikat Das et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10847v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.10847v1</a></p>

<p>The detection of a $\simeq220$~PeV muon neutrino by the KM3NeT neutrino telescope offers an unprecedented opportunity to probe the Universe at extreme energies. We analyze the origin of this event under three scenarios, viz., a transient point source, a diffuse astrophysical emission, and line-of-sight interaction of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECR; $E \gtrsim 0.1$~EeV). Our analysis includes the flux from both a KM3NeT-only fit and a joint fit, incorporating data from KM3NeT, IceCube, and Pierre Auger Observatory. If the neutrino event originates from transients, it requires a new population of transient that is energetic, gamma-ray dark, and more abundant than known ones. In the framework of diffuse astrophysical emission, we compare the required local UHECR energy injection rate at $\gtrsim4$ EeV, assuming a proton primary, with the rate derived from the flux measurements by Auger. This disfavors the KM3NeT-only fit at all redshifts, while the joint fit remains viable for $z\gtrsim 1$, based on redshift evolution models of known source populations. For cosmogenic origin from point sources, our results suggest that the luminosity obtained at redshifts $z \lesssim 1$ from the joint fit is compatible with the Eddington luminosity of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei.</p>

<p>2025-04-15, <strong>Combined Evidence for the $X_{17}$ Boson After PADME Results on Resonant Production in Positron Annihilation</strong>, Fernando Arias-AragÃ³n et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11439v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.11439v1</a></p>

<p>The Positron Annihilation into Dark Matter Experiment at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati has reported an excess of $e^+e^-$ final-state events from positron annihilation on fixed-target atomic electrons. While the global significance remains at the $1.8\,\sigma$ level, the excess is centered around $\sqrt{s} \sim 17\,\text{MeV}$, coinciding with the invariant mass at which anomalous $e^+e^-$ pair production has previously been observed in nuclear transitions from excited to ground states in $^8$Be, $^4$He and $^{12}$C, thereby strengthening the case for a common underlying origin, possibly involving a hypothetical new $X_{17}$ boson. We discuss the significance of this independent accelerator-based evidence. Combining it with existing nuclear physics results, we obtain a value for the $X_{17}$ mass of $m_{X_{17}} = 16.88 \pm 0.05\,$ MeV, reducing the uncertainty from nuclear physics determinations alone by more than a factor of two.</p>

<p>2025-04-15, <strong>The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and Fundamental Plane in the light of $f(R)$ gravity</strong>, V. Borka JovanoviÄ et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11135v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.11135v1</a></p>

<p>Here we use the samples of spiral and elliptical galaxies, in order to investigate theoretically some of their properties and to test the empirical relations, in the light of modified gravities. We show that the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation can be described in the light of $f(R)$ gravity, without introducing the dark matter. Also, it is possible to explain the features of fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies without the dark matter hypothesis.</p>

<p>2025-04-15, <strong>Hints for a Geon from Causal Dynamic Triangulations</strong>, Axel Maas et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11047v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.11047v1</a></p>

<p>The existence of geons, physical states of self-bound gravitons, has long been proposed. In the context of four-dimensional causal dynamical triangulation simulations we investigate this possibility by measuring curvature-curvature correlators of different gravitational operators. We find a behavior consistent with a massive state, independent of the operators considered, over a certain distance window. While at most a hint, this is tantalizing due to its possible implications for dark matter or (primordial) black holes. We also find indications that the phase of rapid expansion of the obtained de Sitter universe impacts the mass, and relates to quantum fluctuations of space-time.</p>

<p>2025-04-15, <strong>Dark Matter and Electroweak Phase Transition in the $Z_2$ Symmetric Georgi-Machacek Model</strong>, Chih-Ting Lu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10930v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.10930v1</a></p>

<p>We present a comprehensive investigation of the $Z_2$ symmetric Georgi-Machacek (GM) model, focusing on the dark matter (DM) in the model and the electroweak phase transition (EWPT). Our analysis encompasses multiple detections for the DM candidates, including collider searches at the LHC and LEP, the direct detection and indirect detection. Furthermore, we also explore the possibility of a first-order EWPT in this framework. The gravitational wave (GW) generated from the first-order EWPT also provides a detection method for the parameter space in the $Z_2$ symmetric GM model providing viable DM candidate. It is found that the current DM searches, especially the direct detection, provide strong constraints on the parameter space, while the GW signal can be complementary around the Higgs resonant region.</p>

<p>2025-04-15, <strong>A magnetar powers the luminous supernova 2023pel, associated with a long gamma-ray burst</strong>, L. M. Roman Aguilar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11414v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.11414v1</a></p>

<p>We explore SN 2023pel, the most recent event associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), specifically GRB 230812B. SN 2023pel has a high luminosity and low expansion velocities compared to other GRB-SNe. These properties seem difficult to reconcile with a single nickel power source. We searched for models that can explain the properties of this event. We calculated a grid of hydrodynamic models based on pre-SN structures derived from evolutionary calculations. We compared our models with observations of SN~2023pel and selected our preferred model using statistical analysis, taking both light curves and expansion velocities into account. This allowed us to derive a set of physical properties for SN~2023pel. Our models suggest that the most probable scenario involves a millisecond magnetar as the primary power source, supplemented by energy from radioactive decay. Our preferred model has a spin period of P = 3.2 ms, a magnetic field of B = 28 x 10^14 G, an explosion energy of 2.3 foe, a nickel mass of M_Ni= 0.24 solar masses, and an ejected mass of 3.4 solar masses. Alternatively, we find that a purely nickel-powered model also provides a good match with the observations, though M_Ni &gt; 0.8 solar masses are always required. However, the combination of such high values of M_Ni and low M_ej is difficult to reconcile, indicating that this scenario is less probable. We have also identified a specific region within the peak luminosity-velocity plane where an additional energy source beyond nickel may be necessary to power SNe with characteristics similar to SN~2023pel. Our study indicates that an additional energy source beyond radioactive decay is essential to explain the high brightness and relatively low expansion velocities of SN 2023pel. A magnetar-powered model, similar to the models proposed for the very luminous GRB-SN 2011kl, aligns well with these characteristics.</p>

<p>2025-04-15, <strong>Constraints on Generalized Gravity-Thermodynamic Cosmology from DESI DR2</strong>, Udit K. Tyagi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11308v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.11308v1</a></p>

<p>We explore the cosmological implications of generalized entropic models within the framework of Gravity-Thermodynamics (GT) approaches. These models, characterized by three or four additional free parameters, are designed to capture deviations from the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and can reproduce well-known entropic formulations, including Tsallis, R'enyi, Sharma-Mittal, Barrow, Kaniadakis, and Loop Quantum Gravity entropies in various analytical limits. We implement the corresponding cosmological models using a fully numerical GT approach to constrain the model parameters and to study the evolution of the dark energy equation of state as a function of the scale factor. Our Bayesian analysis, which incorporates the Pantheon+ and DESy5 supernovae data alongside the recently released DESI-DR2/DR1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, shows that the data favor the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, leading to a $\Lambda$CDM-like late-time behavior. In this context, the three-parameter ($\mathcal{S}_3$) entropic model appears to be sufficient to capture the observed dark energy phenomenology. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the Bayesian evidence indicates that the three-parameter model is preferred over the four-parameter ($\mathcal{S}_4$) variant by a factor of $\Delta\log\mathcal{B} \sim -6$, while the GT approach as a whole is significantly disfavored relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model with at least $\Delta\log\mathcal{B} \sim -8$ ($\mathcal{S}_3$) to $\Delta\log\mathcal{B} \sim -13$ ($\mathcal{S}_4$), when using the DESy5 and DESI-DR2 datasets.</p>

<p>2025-04-15, <strong>Radiative-transfer models for dusty Type II supernovae</strong>, Luc Dessart et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10928v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.10928v1</a></p>

<p>Dust is expected to form on a year timescale in core-collapse supernova (SN) ejecta. Its existence is revealed through an infrared brightening, an optical dimming, or a blue-red emission-line profile asymmetry. To investigate how the dust location and amount impact observations, we computed ultraviolet-to-optical spectra of interacting and standard, noninteracting Type II SNe using state-of-the-art models â for simplicity we adopted 0.1micron silicate grains. These models account for the full ejecta and treat both radioactive decay and shock power that arises from interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material. In a Type IIn SN such as 1998S at one year, approximately 3e-4Msun of dust within the dense shell reproduces the broad, asymmetric Halpha profile. It causes an optical dimming of ~2mag (which obscures any emission from the inner, metal-rich ejecta) but, paradoxically, a more modest dimming of the ultraviolet, which originates from the outer parts of the dense shell. In Type II SNe with late-time interaction, such as SN2017eaw, dust in the low-mass, fast outer ejecta dense shell tends to be optically thin, impacting little the optical spectrum for dust masses of order 1e-4Msun. In such SNe II with interaction, dust in the inner metal-rich ejecta has negligible effect on observed spectra in the ultraviolet and optical. In noninteracting SNe II, dust within the metal-rich ejecta preferentially quenches the [OI]6300,6364 and [CaII]7291,7323 metal lines, biasing the emission in favor of the H-rich material which generates the Halpha and FeII emission below 5500A. Our model with 5e-4Msun of dust below 2000km/s matches closely the optical spectrum of SN1987A at 714d. Modeling historical SNe requires treating both the ejecta material and the dust, as well as multiple power sources, although interaction power will generally dominate.</p>
