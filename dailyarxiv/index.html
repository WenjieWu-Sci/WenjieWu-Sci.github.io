<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Features of Charged Lepton Flavor Violation in an $A_4$ Symmetric Neutrino Mass Model</strong>, Pravesh Chndra Awasthi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23747v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23747v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino flavour oscillations imply that there must be charged lepton flavour violation (CLFV) also. Different neutrino mass models predict different patterns of CLFV decays. Neutrino mass generation through standard see-saw mechanisms leads to the prediction that the branching ratios of meson CLFV decays will always be smaller than the corresponding radiative CLFV decays. In this work, we analyse an interesting neutrino mass model, based on $A_4$ symmetry, in which the symmetry and the symmetry-breaking pattern lead the neutrino mixing matrix to be of tri-bimaximal (TBM) form. In this model, we find that the meson CLFV decay amplitudes are not correlated to the corresponding radiative CLFV amplitudes, unlike in the case of see-saw models. The branching ratios of radiative CLFV decays are predicted to be negligibly small in this model, but those of the meson CLFV decays can be large enough to be observable in the near future.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Accretion Regimes of Neutrino-Cooled Flows onto Black Holes</strong>, Javiera Hernández-Morales et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23691v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23691v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino-cooled accretion disks can form in the aftermath of neutron-star mergers as well as during the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars (collapsars) and the accretion-induced collapse of rapidly rotating white dwarfs. Due to Pauli blocking as electrons become degenerate at sufficiently high accretion rates $\dot{M}$, the resulting ‘self-neutronization’ of the dissociated accreting plasma makes these astrophysical systems promising sources of rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis (the r-process). We present a one-dimensional general-relativistic, viscous-hydrodynamic model of neutrino-cooled accretion disks around black holes. With collapsars, super-collapsars and very massive star collapse in mind, we chart the composition of the accretion flow and systematically explore different radiatively efficient and inefficient accretion regimes with increasing $\dot M$, across a vast parameter space of $\dot{M}\sim 10^{-6}-10^6 M_\odot \,\text{s}^{-1}$, black hole masses of $M_\bullet\sim 1 - 10^4 M_\odot$ and dimensionless spins of $\chi_\bullet \in [0,1)$, as well as $\alpha$-viscosity values of $\alpha\sim 10^{-3}-1$. We show that these accretion regimes are separated by characteristic thresholds $\dot{M}_{\rm char}$ that follow power laws $\dot M_{\rm char}\propto M_{\bullet}^\alpha \alpha^\beta$ and that can be understood based on analytic approximations we derive. We find that outflows from such disks are promising sites of r-process nucleosynthesis up to $M_\bullet \lesssim 3000 M_\odot$. These give rise to lanthanide-bearing ‘red’ super-kilonovae transients mostly for $M_\bullet \lesssim 200-500 M_\odot$ and lanthanide suppressed ‘blue’ super-kilonovae for larger $M_\bullet$. Proton-rich outflows can develop specifically for large black hole masses ($M_\bullet \gtrsim 100 M_\odot$) in certain accretion regimes, which may give rise to proton-rich isotopes via the $\nu$p-process.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Latest neutrino results from the FASER experiment and their implications for forward hadron production</strong>, FASER Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23552v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23552v1</a></p>

<p>The muon puzzle – an excess of muons relative to simulation predictions in ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray air showers – has been reported by many experiments. This suggests that forward particle production in hadronic interactions is not fully understood. Some of the scenarios proposed to resolve this predict reduced production of forward neutral pions and enhanced production of forward kaons (or other particles). The FASER experiment at the LHC is located 480 m downstream of the ATLAS interaction point and is sensitive to neutrinos and muons, which are the decay products of forward charged pions and kaons. In this study, the latest measurements of electron and muon neutrino fluxes are presented using the data corresponding to 9.5 $\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ and 65.6 $\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ of proton-proton collisions with $\sqrt{s}=13.6~\mathrm{TeV}$ by the FASER$\nu$ and the FASER electronic detector, respectively. These fluxes are compared with predictions from recent hadronic interaction models, including EPOS-LHCr, SIBYLL 2.3e, and QGSJET 3. The predictions are generally consistent with the measured fluxes from FASER, although some discrepancies appear in certain energy bins. More precise flux measurements with additional data will follow soon, enabling validation of pion, kaon, and charm meson production with finer energy binning, reduced uncertainties, and multi-differential analyses.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Consistent $N_{\rm eff}$ fitting in big bang nucleosynthesis analysis</strong>, Sougata Ganguly et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23354v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23354v1</a></p>

<p>The effective number of neutrino species, $N_{\rm eff}$, serves as a key fitting parameter extensively employed in cosmological studies. In this work, we point out a fundamental inconsistency in the conventional treatment of $N_{\rm eff}$ in big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), particularly regarding its applicability to new physics scenarios where $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, the deviation of $N_{\rm eff}$ from the standard BBN prediction, is negative. To ensure consistent interpretation, it is imperative to either restrict the allowed range of $N_{\rm eff}$ or systematically adjust neutrino-induced reaction rates based on physically motivated assumptions. As a concrete example, we consider a simple scenario in which a negative $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ arises from entropy injection into the electromagnetic sector due to the decay of long-lived particles after neutrino decoupling. This process dilutes the neutrino density and suppresses the rate of neutrino-driven neutron-proton conversion. Under this assumption, we demonstrate that the resulting BBN constraints on $N_{\rm eff}$ deviate significantly from those obtained by the conventional, but unphysical, extrapolation of dark radiation scenarios into the $\Delta N_{\rm eff} &lt; 0$ regime.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Simulation-based inference for Precision Neutrino Physics through Neural Monte Carlo tuning</strong>, A. Gavrikov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23297v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23297v1</a></p>

<p>Precise modeling of detector energy response is crucial for next-generation neutrino experiments which present computational challenges due to lack of analytical likelihoods. We propose a solution using neural likelihood estimation within the simulation-based inference framework. We develop two complementary neural density estimators that model likelihoods of calibration data: conditional normalizing flows and a transformer-based regressor. We adopt JUNO - a large neutrino experiment - as a case study. The energy response of JUNO depends on several parameters, all of which should be tuned, given their non-linear behavior and strong correlations in the calibration data. To this end, we integrate the modeled likelihoods with Bayesian nested sampling for parameter inference, achieving uncertainties limited only by statistics with near-zero systematic biases. The normalizing flows model enables unbinned likelihood analysis, while the transformer provides an efficient binned alternative. By providing both options, our framework offers flexibility to choose the most appropriate method for specific needs. Finally, our approach establishes a template for similar applications across experimental neutrino and broader particle physics.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>High-redshift Galaxies from JWST Observations in More Realistic Dark Matter Halo Models</strong>, Saeed Fakhry et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23742v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23742v1</a></p>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled unexpectedly massive galaxy candidates at high redshifts, challenging standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological predictions. In this work, we study the predictions of more realistic dark matter halo models combined with modified matter power spectra for interpreting JWST observations of high-redshift galaxies. We employ three halo mass functions: the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) model and two physically motivated alternatives introduced by Del Popolo (DP1 and DP2). Our analysis of cumulative stellar mass densities at $z \simeq 8$–$10$ reveals that the standard ST mass function systematically underpredicts JWST observations, achieving marginal consistency only with high star formation efficiencies. In contrast, the DP1 and DP2 models demonstrate significantly improved agreement with observations even within standard $\Lambda$CDM, with statistical consistency within $1$–$2\sigma$ for moderate star formation efficiencies. When combined with modified power spectra, these refined halo models achieve suitable agreement with JWST data across broad parameter ranges, particularly for steeper spectral indices that amplify high-mass halo formation. Crucially, we find that moderate star formation efficiencies coupled with small-scale power enhancements provide robust reconciliation between theory and observations, eliminating the need for extreme astrophysical assumptions. Our results demonstrate that incorporating realistic halo collapse physics, often neglected in standard analyses, can substantially alleviate apparent tensions between JWST observations and $\Lambda$CDM predictions, highlighting the critical importance of small-scale structure formation physics in early cosmic epochs.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Quantum-enhanced dark matter detection using Schrödinger cat states</strong>, Pan Zheng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23538v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23538v1</a></p>

<p>Quantum metrology enables sensitive dark matter detection, particularly using nonclassical states, such as Schr"odinger cat states featuring sub-Planck interference structures in microwave cavities. Here, we report the first experimental application of four-component Schr"odinger cat states within a high-quality superconducting microwave cavity to detect dark photons, a potential dark matter candidate. We demonstrate an 8.1-fold enhancement in the signal photon rate and constrain the dark photon kinetic mixing angle to an unprecedented $\epsilon &lt; 7.32 \times 10^{-16}$ near 6.44~GHz (26.6~$\mu$eV). By employing a parametric sideband drive to actively tune the cavity frequency, we achieve dark photon searches and background subtraction across multiple frequency bins, yielding a sensitivity at the $10^{-16}$ level within a 100~kHz bandwidth. Our Schr"odinger’s cat-assisted detection (SCaD) scheme demonstrates a substantial improvement over previous results, promising potential implications in quantum-enhanced searches for new physics.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Probing Cosmic Ray Composition and Muon-philic Dark Matter via Muon Tomography</strong>, Cheng-en Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23458v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23458v1</a></p>

<p>This work presents a novel cosmic-ray scattering experiment employing a Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) muon tomography system. By introducing the scattering angle between incident and outgoing cosmic-ray tracks as a key observable, this approach enables simultaneous studies of secondary cosmic-ray composition and searching for new physics. During a 63-day campaign, 1.18 million cosmic ray scattering events were recorded and analyzed. By performing combined template fits to the observed angular distribution, particle abundances are measured, for example, resolving the electron component at $\sim 2\%$ precision. Furthermore, constraints are established on elastic muon-dark matter (DM) scattering cross-sections for muon-philic dark matter. At the 95\% confidence level, the limit reaches 1.62 $\times$ $10^{-17}$ $\rm{cm}^{2}$ for 1 GeV slow DM, demonstrating sensitivity limit to light muon-coupled slow DM.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Automated calibration of simulated galaxy catalogues for cosmological analyses</strong>, I. Tutusaus et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23451v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23451v1</a></p>

<p>Simulated galaxy catalogues have become an essential tool for preparing and exploiting observations from galaxy surveys. They constitute a key ingredient in modelling the systematic uncertainties present in the analysis. However, in order to reach the large volume and high precision required for galaxy surveys, we generally populate dark matter haloes with galaxies following certain theoretical recipes. Such recipes contain free parameters that are calibrated comparing the simulations against observations, but the creation of galaxy mocks is a stochastic process with a large number of free parameters to calibrate. We present a new pipeline, based on the differential evolution algorithm, that can calibrate galaxy mocks in a fully automated way for realistic scenarios with a large parameter space. We apply the pipeline to galaxy mocks built on a combination of halo occupation distribution and sub-halo abundance matching techniques. We show that our pipeline can properly calibrate the galaxy mocks against observations for both $\Lambda$CDM and modified gravity halo catalogues. This type of calibration pipeline provides a new tool for automating the calibration of future massive galaxy mocks.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Jet-Driven Formation of Bipolar Rings in Planetary Nebulae: Numerical Simulations Inspired by NGC 1514</strong>, Muhammad Akashi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23670v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23670v1</a></p>

<p>We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of jets launched into a dense shell, reproducing two rings in a bipolar structure that resemble the two dusty rings of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 1514. The scenario we simulate assumes that a strong binary interaction enhanced the mass loss rate from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar progenitor of NGC 1514, and shortly thereafter, the main-sequence companion accreted mass from the AGB star, launching a pair of jets. We find that adiabatic flows, where radiative losses are negligible, produce prominent rings, as observed in the infrared in NGC 1514. In contrast, when radiative cooling is significant, the rings are thin and faint. Our results reinforce the prevailing notion that jets play a substantial role in shaping planetary nebulae (PNe). More generally, as the binary companion to the central star of NGC 1514 avoided common envelope evolution, our results suggest that jets play a major role in many binary systems experiencing stable mass transfer at high rates. This conclusion complements the view that jets play a significant role in unstable mass transfer, specifically in common envelope evolution. Studies of strongly interacting binary systems, whether stable or not, should include jets. If jets continue to be active after ring formation, the outcomes are circum-jet rings, as observed in some other PNe and core-collapse supernova remnants.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Nuclear Matter and Finite Nuclei: Relativistic Thomas-Fermi Approximation Versus Relativistic Mean-Field Approach</strong>, Shuying Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23587v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23587v1</a></p>

<p>The Thomas-Fermi approximation is a powerful method that has been widely used to describe atomic structures, finite nuclei, and nonuniform matter in supernovae and neutron-star crusts. Nonuniform nuclear matter at subnuclear density is assumed to be composed of a lattice of heavy nuclei surrounded by dripped nucleons, and the Wigner-Seitz cell is commonly introduced to simplify the calculations. The self-consistent Thomas–Fermi approximation can be employed to study both a nucleus surrounded by nucleon gas in the Wigner-Seitz cell and an isolated nucleus in the nuclide chart. A detailed comparison is made between the self-consistent Thomas-Fermi approximation and the relativistic mean-field approach for the description of finite nuclei, based on the same nuclear interaction. These results are then examined using experimental data from the corresponding nuclei.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Classifying Compact Radio Emission in Nearby Galaxies: a 10GHz Study of Active Galactic Nuclei, Supernovae, Anomalous Microwave Emission and Star Forming Regions</strong>, Kristen C. Dage et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23332v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23332v1</a></p>

<p>We present 115 compact radio point sources in three galaxies, NGC 5474, NGC 4631 and M51, taken in the most extended (A-)configuration of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 10GHz. Several of these compact radio point sources have diffuse counterparts identified in previous multi-band studies of resolved radio continuum emission. We find compact counterparts to eight star forming regions, four anomalous microwave emission candidates, and one supernova remnant (SN 2011dh). Nine of the compact radio sources match X-ray counterparts, the majority of which are background galaxies. These AGN are all within the D25 (isophotal diameter) of the host galaxy and might act as contaminants for X-ray binary population studies, highlighting the need for high-resolution multi-band imaging. This study showcases the broad number of science cases that require sensitive radio facilities, like the upcoming Square Kilometre Array and the planned next generation Very Large Array.</p>
