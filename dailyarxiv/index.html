<p>2025-12-31, <strong>Anomalous (3+1)d Fermionic Topological Quantum Field Theories via Symmetry Extension</strong>, Zheyan Wan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25038v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.25038v1</a></p>

<p>Discrete finite-group global symmetries may suffer from nonperturbative ‘t-Hooft anomalies. Such global anomalies can be canceled by anomalous symmetry-preserving topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), which contain no local point operators but only extended excitations such as line and surface operators. In this work, we study mixed gauge-gravitational nonperturbative global anomalies of Weyl fermions (or Weyl semimetals in condensed matter) charged under discrete Abelian internal symmetries in four-dimensional spacetime, with spacetime-internal fermionic symmetry $G=$Spin$\times_{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}}\mathbb{Z}_{2m}^{\rm F}$ or Spin$\times\mathbb{Z}_n$ that contains fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\rm F}$. We determine the minimal finite gauge group $K$ of anomalous $G$-symmetric TQFTs that can match the fermionic anomaly via the symmetry-extension construction $1 \to K \to G_{\rm Tot} \to G \to 1$, where the anomaly in $G$ is trivialized upon pullback to $G_{\rm Tot}$, computed by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer eta invariant. This allows one to replace a $G$-symmetric four-dimensional Weyl fermion by an anomalous $G$-symmetric discrete-$K$-gauge TQFT as an alternative low-energy theory in the same deformation class. As an application, we show that the four-dimensional Standard Model with 15 Weyl fermions per family, in the absence of a sterile right-handed neutrino $ν_R$, exhibits mixed gauge-gravitational global anomalies between baryon and lepton number symmetries $({\bf B \pm L})$ and spacetime diffeomorphisms. We identify the corresponding minimal $K$-gauge fermionic TQFT that cancels these anomalies and can be interpreted as a gapped, topologically ordered dark sector replacing missing Weyl fermions via symmetry extension, without invoking conventional Anderson-Higgs symmetry breaking.</p>

<p>2025-12-31, <strong>Large Neutrino-Dark Matter Interactions: From Effective Field Theory to Ultraviolet Completions</strong>, K. S. Babu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25035v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.25035v1</a></p>

<p>We develop a general effective field theory (EFT) framework for neutrino-dark matter (DM) interactions, and apply it to systematically find all possible gauge-invariant ultraviolet (UV) completions at a given EFT operator dimension. Our goal here is to find simple UV-complete models that can realize potentially large neutrino-DM interactions, while being consistent with all existing theoretical and experimental constraints. We first construct the leading non-derivative operator basis for neutrino-DM scattering in a low-energy effective theory with neutrinos and DM (DM-LEFT), together with its gauge-invariant embedding in the Standard Model EFT (DM-SMEFT). We then construct all renormalizable tree-level UV completions that generate the relevant DM-SMEFT operators up to dimension-8 using a topology-based classification. Using this framework, we present minimal UV-complete models for different DM types that can yield effective neutrino-DM couplings up to several orders of magnitude larger than the Fermi coupling, while satisfying all constraints, most notably from neutrino mass and from the charged-lepton sector. This includes a pseudo-Dirac fermion DM realization in the scotogenic neutrino mass model and models of Majorana DM inspired by type-II and inverse seesaw-based neutrino mass models. Phenomenological implications for DM thermal relic abundance and direct detection prospects, as well as various cosmological and laboratory constraints on the model parameter space, are also analyzed.</p>

<p>2025-12-31, <strong>Universal Seesaw Pati-Salam Model with P for Strong CP</strong>, K. S. Babu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25028v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.25028v1</a></p>

<p>We develop a universal seesaw version of the Pati-Salam model wherein quarks and leptons of each family are unified into common multiplets transforming as $ψ_L(2,1,4))+ ψ_R((1,2,4)$ under the $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times SU(4)_c$ gauge symmetry. Parity symmetry is spontaneously broken in the model, which helps in solving the strong CP problem without the axion. The Higgs sector of the model is very simple, consisting of a single pair of $H_L(2,1,4)+ H_R(1,2,4)$ fields. Fermion masses arise through mixing of the chiral fermions with vector-like quarks and leptons contained in $(1,1,15)$ as well as $(1,1,10)_L+(1,1,10)_R$ multiplets via a universal seesaw mechanism. Consistency of such a spectrum with the observed quark and lepton masses is established. The parity solution to the strong CP problem is shown to be effective in this framework, although there are new loop contributions to $\overlineθ$, compared to the analogous left-right symmetric model, arising from color sextet and octet fermions, as well as from diagrams mediated by leptoquark bosons. We also find that, in this setup, although lepton number is broken, neutrino masses remain zero at the tree-level. Small and finite Majorana neutrino masses are induced via one-loop diagrams, which we analyze and show to be compatible with oscillation experiments.</p>

<p>2025-12-31, <strong>Loop-Level Lepton Flavor Violation and Diphoton Signals in the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model</strong>, Shufang Qiang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25019v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.25019v1</a></p>

<p>The left-right symmetric model (LRSM) could not only restore parity of the weak interaction, but also provide natural explanations of the tiny active neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanisms. The $SU(2)_R$-breaking scalar $H_3$ can induce lepton flavor violating (LFV) effects in the minimal version of LRSM at the 1-loop order, originating from the mixing of heavy right-handed neutrinos. If $H_3$ is light, say below the GeV scale, it will lead to rich signals, e.g. the LFV muon and tauon decays $\ell_β\to \ell_α+ X$ ($X$ being either visible or invisible final states) and the anomalous supernova signatures. Combined with the diphoton coupling of $H_3$, the right-handed scale $v_R$ is excluded up to $2\times10^9$ GeV. In the future, the $v_R$ scale can be probed up to $5\times10^9$ GeV in high-precision muon experiments, and further up to $6\times10^{11}$ GeV by supernova observations.</p>

<p>2025-12-31, <strong>Minimal Modular Flavor Symmetry and Lepton Textures Near Fixed Points</strong>, Zurab Tavartkiladze et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24804v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.24804v1</a></p>

<p>An extension of the Standard Model with $Γ_2\simeq S_3$ modular flavor symmetry is presented. We consider the construction of the lepton sector, augmented by two right-handed neutrino states, in the vicinity of the fixed points $τ= i\infty $ and $τ= i$. Due to the residual symmetries at these points, and with the aid of non-holomorphic modular forms (which constitute representations of $S_3$) and by assigning specific transformation properties to the fermion fields, highly economical models (without flavon fields) are constructed with interesting Yukawa textures. All presented models strongly prefer the inverted ordering for the neutrino masses.</p>

<p>2025-12-31, <strong>Primordial black hole dark matter from ultra-slow-roll inflation in Horndeski gravity</strong>, Despina Totolou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25044v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.25044v1</a></p>

<p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a well-motivated non-particle candidate for dark matter, requiring an enhancement of curvature perturbations on small inflationary scales consistent with observational constraints. In this work we study PBH production within Horndeski gravity, accounting for compatibility with the GW170817 constraint on the gravitational-wave speed and imposing a constant coupling to the Ricci scalar. Under these conditions, and assuming an inflaton field characterised by a canonical kinetic term and a smooth potential, the inflationary dynamics is controlled by the cubic Horndeski interaction. We show that a suitable kinetic dependence of the latter enhances the effective friction acting on the inflaton, inducing a transient ultra-slow-roll phase embedded in an otherwise standard slow-roll evolution. Interestingly, this mechanism amplifies the curvature power spectrum on small scales without introducing any feature in the potential. For representative parameter choices we find that pronounced peaks in the scalar power spectrum are generated, leading to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs with masses of order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})\,M_\odot$, which can account for a substantial fraction of the dark matter abundance, reaching $f_{\rm PBH}\simeq 0.9$, while satisfying current observational constraints. The resulting sharp features in the scalar power spectrum also imply potentially observable scalar-induced gravitational-wave signatures.</p>

<p>2025-12-31, <strong>GEQIE Framework for Rapid Quantum Image Encoding</strong>, Rafał Potempa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24973v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.24973v1</a></p>

<p>This work presents a Python framework named after the General Equation of Quantum Image Encoding (GEQIE). The framework creates the image-encoding state using a unitary gate, which can later be transpiled to target quantum backends. The benchmarking results, simulated with different noise levels, demonstrate the correctness of the already implemented encoding methods and the usability of the framework for more sophisticated research tasks based on quantum image encodings. Additionally, we present a showcase example of Cosmic Web dark-matter density snapshot encoding and high-accuracy retrieval (PCC = 0.995) to demonstrate the extendability of the GEQIE framework to multidimensional data and its applicability to other fields of research.</p>

<p>2025-12-31, <strong>Discovery of a galaxy associated with the HI cloud FAST J0139+4328</strong>, Ana Mitrašinović et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24924v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.24924v1</a></p>

<p>The search for ``dark galaxies,’’ a key prediction of the lambda cold dark matter, has yielded few viable candidates. Recently, FAST J0139+4328 was reported as the first isolated dark galaxy in the nearby universe, based on a neutral hydrogen (HI) detection and a non-detection in the Pan-STARRS1 survey. To verify the nature of this candidate, we obtained deep optical imaging, using the $1.4\,\mathrm{m}$ \textit{Milanković} and $0.6\,\mathrm{m}$ \textit{Nedeljković} telescopes, and spectroscopic follow-up of the field. We report the unambiguous discovery of a low-surface-brightness (LSB) optical counterpart at the location of the HI cloud. Furthermore, the detection of H$α$ emission via the $6\,\mathrm{m}$ Big Telescope Alt-Azimuthal (BTA) confirms that the stellar system lies at a redshift consistent with the HI source, establishing their physical association. Through detailed photometry and employing color-dependent mass-to-light scaling relations, we derive a total stellar mass of $M_\star = (7.2 \pm 3.7) \times 10^6\, M_{\odot}$, about an order of magnitude higher than the previously estimated upper limit. Using the literature HI mass, this implies a gas-to-stellar mass ratio of $M_{\mathrm{HI}} / M_{\star} = 11.5 \pm 6.4$. Our findings demonstrate that FAST J0139+4328 is not a dark galaxy but an extremely gas-rich LSB dwarf galaxy, whose stellar component was simply below the detection limit of the Pan-STARRS1 survey. This reclassification resolves the status of this prominent dark galaxy candidate and underscores the necessity of deep optical follow-up to classify faint HI-selected systems.</p>

<p>2025-12-31, <strong>Probing a NED inspired Magnetically Charged Black Hole in the Hernquist Dark Matter Halo</strong>, Sohan Kumar Jha et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24753v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.24753v1</a></p>

<p>With an intent to examine the combined effect of non-linear electrodynamics (NED) and dark matter (DM), we obtain a static and spherically symmetric solution with the black hole (BH) magnetically charged and immersed in the Hernquist DM halo (MHDM). The position of the event horizon $r_h$ and the critical impact parameter $b_m$ are then probed to gauge the extent of influence magnetic charge $g$ and halo parameters $α$, $β$ have on them. A recurring outcome of our analysis with respect to different BH observables is the nullification of competing effects of charge and halo parameters, leading to observables obtaining values equal to those for a Schwarzschild BH. This is also observed for $r_h$ and $b_m$. We delve into unraveling the impact of NED and DM combined on the strong gravitational lensing (GL) and its related observables, such as the angular separation, relative magnification, and the angular position of the inner, closely packed bright ring. Interestingly, we find combinations of charge and halo parameters that leave the deflection angle unchanged from the Schwarzschild case, thereby leading to a situation where an MHDM BH and a Schwarzschild BH become indistinguishable. Similar results are also observed for lensing observables. Finally, utilizing observations related to the angular diameter of super-massive BHs (SMBHs) $M87^<em>$ and $SgrA^</em>$ and employing the $χ^2$ test, we extract bounds on $g$, $α$, and $β$ signifying the viability of our BH model as an SMBH.</p>

<p>2025-12-31, <strong>An Effective Theory for Biased Tracers via the Boltzmann-Equation Approach</strong>, Tomohiro Fujita et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24672v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.24672v1</a></p>

<p>We develop an effective theory for biased tracers formulated at the level of the Boltzmann equation, providing a unified description of density and velocity bias. We introduce a general effective collision term in the tracer Boltzmann equation to encode tracer dynamics that are intrinsically different from those of dark matter. This collision operator leads to modified continuity and Euler equations, with source terms reflecting the collision-term physics. At linear order, this framework predicts time- and scale-dependent bias parameters in a self-consistent manner, encompassing peak bias as a special case while clarifying how velocity bias and higher-derivative effects arise. Applying the resulting bias model to redshift-space distortions, we show that the Boltzmann-equation approach reproduces the power spectrum of biased tracers obtained in the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure up to $k^4$ terms with fewer independent parameters.</p>

<p>2025-12-31, <strong>Aspects of Sommerfeld Enhancement in the light of Halo gamma-ray excess</strong>, Yongsoo Jho et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24662v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.24662v1</a></p>

<p>We examine Sommerfeld enhancement in dark matter annihilation as a potential origin of the halo-like gamma-ray excess near $E_γ\simeq 20$ GeV reported by Totani. A minimal model with a light CP-even scalar mediator naturally produces a velocity-dependent annihilation cross section consistent with thermal freeze-out, the Milky Way excess, and limits from dwarf spheroidal galaxies.</p>

<p>2025-12-31, <strong>Feeling Blue: Constructing a Robust SALT3 UV Template and Constraining its Redshift Dependency</strong>, Qinan Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25064v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.25064v1</a></p>

<p>Upcoming cosmological surveys will obtain numerous rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), yet there is concern about how standardizable SNe Ia are in the UV. In this work, we train a robust optical–UV SED model for SNe Ia (SALT3-UV) with the open-source model-training software $\texttt{SALTshaker}$. We incorporate a spectroscopic UV data sample from HST, including 67 UV spectra from 18 nearby SNe Ia. Unlike previous training spectra, the HST spectra have sufficiently precise calibration that they do not require additional warping to match coincident photometric data. Additionally, while including this new SN Ia sample necessitates incorporating auxiliary photometric data from ZTF and ATLAS that have insufficient calibration for cosmological analyses, the improvements in the calibration of these data is anticipated in the near future. Compared to the previous SALT3-K21 model, the SALT3-UV model shows a significant improvement in the UV down to $2000\mathring{\text{A}}$, with over a threefold improvement in model uncertainty and a more physically accurate continuum and line features. We further evaluate potential redshift evolution in the UV template by separating the UV training sample into low- and high-$z$ subsamples. Our results reveal a non-negligible $\gtrsim 0.05$ mag difference between low- and high-$z$ SALT3-UV models in the $g-$band at $z\gtrsim0.5$ and the $u-$band at $z\gtrsim0.2$. We demonstrate that, if confirmed, such evolution could lead to a few-percent bias in the measurement of $w$ if high-$z$ rest-frame UV data are included in future cosmological surveys such as LSST and $\textit{Roman}$.</p>

<p>2025-12-31, <strong>Cosmological dynamics and observational constraints of an interacting early scalar field coupled to radiation</strong>, Dorian Araya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24918v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.24918v1</a></p>

<p>We study the cosmic evolution of an interacting scalar field radiation model, in which a minimally coupled scalar field exchanges energy with the radiation sector through an exponential coupling. Extending previous formulations, a non-relativistic matter component is included explicitly, which allows a self consistent description of cosmological dynamics from the radiation-dominated era to late-time acceleration. Analytical expressions for the background expansion are derived and characterized using kinematic diagnostics. We constrain the model using observational Hubble data, Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (including DESI DR2), and compressed cosmic microwave background distance information, performing a Bayesian MCMC analysis. The interaction parameter is found to be consistent with zero, though small deviations from standard radiation scaling are allowed. These deviations can partially alleviate the Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon, but this is accompanied by correlated shifts in the matter density. The reconstructed expansion history remains close to LCDM at late times. Model comparison suggest that the interacting scenario is statistically competitive but not decisively preferred by current background data.</p>

<p>2025-12-31, <strong>Destruction of the interstellar dust by a supernova</strong>, Evgenii O. Vasiliev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24677v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.24677v1</a></p>

<p>Destruction of the interstellar dust proceeds primary behind supernova shocks. The previous estimates of the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed in the SN remnant do not take into account the physical properties of the ambient medium. Here we consider how some parameters, i.e. gas density and metallicity, can influence the destruction of the interstellar dust. We show that there are two regimes of the interstellar dust grains destruction in SN remnants: rapid and almost complete in compact low-mass SN remnants expanding in dense medium, and gradual and weak destruction in massive remnants evolving in the low-dense environment. When time for thermal sputtering is close to the dynamical one, i.e. to the SN remnant age, the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed in the SN remnant reaches its maximum value. We find that change of the ambient gas density results in the reduction of the dust mass logarithmically. We argue that dust cooling suppresses the interstellar dust destruction up to a factor of 1.6 by mass. This factor decreases for higher density of the ambient medium. We found that the dust mass depends linearly on gas metallicity as ${\rm log}~M_d \sim {\rm [Z/H]}$ or, in other words, on the dust-to-gas ratio as $M_d \sim ζ_d$. In turn, the destruction efficiency is higher in low-metallicity environments due to relatively longer adiabatic phase. We point out that the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed per one SN in a high density environment of the high star formation regions like in local ultraluminous infrared and high-redshift massive galaxies is about several times smaller than that in the Milky Way diffuse medium.</p>

<p>2025-12-31, <strong>Dust destruction in bubbles driven by multiple supernovae explosions</strong>, Evgenii O. Vasiliev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24670v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.24670v1</a></p>

<p>Dust lifetime derived from an isolated supernova (SN) evolution in the interstellar medium is known to be an order of magnitude shorter than the time needed to replenish dust mass by its production in various Galactic sources. We show, using 3-D numerical hydrodynamical simulations, that destruction of dust in the case of multiple SNe in a star cluster is markedly different from that in an isolated SN. We find that the mass of dust destroyed in the bubble does not grow for a considerable time, while SNe continue to explode. This regime is attained at saturation timescale, which is proportional to SNe rate in cluster. We show that the mass of dust destroyed in bubble per SN decreases for higher SN rate. Thus, the destruction efficiency – defined as the ratio of the the total mass of dust destroyed by clustered SNe to that destroyed by the same number of isolated SNe – in bubbles evolved in a homogeneous medium drops for massive clusters, e.g. around clusters with $M_\ast &gt; 4\times 10^4 M_\odot$ it is less $0.4$\%. For lower mass clusters, the efficiency is proportional to the average time delay between SNe. We found that each cluster with $M_\ast &lt; 4\times 10^4 M_\odot$ destroys the same mass of dust as a single isolated SN. In a clumpy medium in bubbles formed around clusters with $M_\ast \sim 4\times 10^4 M_\odot$ and up to 4 times around $M_\ast \sim 8\times 10^5 M_\odot$. We argue that the interstellar dust swept up by multiple SNe almost completely survives in the shells of bubbles around such massive clusters. Therefore, the destruction of the interstellar dust is controlled by SNe in low-mass clusters. We point out that the interstellar dust lifetime for a given SN rate is at least a factor $\sim 10$ longer as compared to the estimates derived from an isolated SN. (abridged)</p>
