<p>2025-10-07, <strong>Multiprobe constraints on early and late time dark energy</strong>, Alexander Reeves et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06114v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.06114v1</a></p>

<p>We perform a multiprobe analysis combining cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), ACT CMB lensing, and large-scale structure (LSS) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), including DESI Legacy Imaging Survey (LS) galaxies and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). We present the first $5\times2$pt analysis of ACT DR6 lensing, DESI LS, and Planck ISW. Within $\Lambda$CDM, this yields $S_8 = \sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.819 \pm 0.016$, in good agreement with primary CMB inferences and provides a sound-horizon-free Hubble constant constraint of $H_0 = 70.0 \pm 4.4$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Then, combining with CMB primary and BAO, we reconfirm a CMB-BAO discrepancy in the $\Omega_m$-$\frac{D_v}{r_d}$ plane, which is heightened when combining BAO with the $5\times2$pt data vector. We explore two dark-energy extensions that may reconcile this: an early-time modification, early dark energy (EDE), and late-time dynamical dark energy (DDE) parameterized by $w_0w_a$. For CMB primary+BAO+$5\times2$pt, we find a $3.3\sigma$ preference for DDE over $\Lambda$CDM, while EDE is modestly favoured at $2.3\sigma$. The models address different shortcomings of $\Lambda$CDM: DDE relaxes the neutrino mass bound ($M_\nu&lt;0.17$eV vs. $&lt;0.050$eV under $\Lambda$CDM), making it compatible with neutrino oscillation measurements, while EDE raises the Hubble constant to $H_0=70.5\pm1.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, easing the discrepancy with SH0ES. However, neither model resolves both issues simultaneously. Our analysis indicates that both DDE and EDE remain viable extensions of $\Lambda$CDM within current uncertainties and demonstrates the capacity of combined probes to place increasingly stringent constraints on cosmological parameters.</p>

<p>2025-10-07, <strong>nCTEQ global analysis of nuclear PDFs</strong>, M. Klasen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05880v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.05880v1</a></p>

<p>We review the series of specific nCTEQ analyses of nuclear parton distribution functions (PDFs) published since 2020 and present preliminary results of a new global analysis. Building on a modern proton baseline without nuclear data and extending the kinematic range, it combines and updates the previous separate analyses that focused on Jefferson Lab neutral-current deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), neutrino DIS and dimuon production, and the currently available CERN LHC data, in particular on W/Z-boson, single inclusive hadron, and heavy-quark production.</p>

<p>2025-10-07, <strong>Gravitational Wave Signatures of Warm Dark Matter in Gauge Extensions of the Standard Model</strong>, Lucia A. Popa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05841v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.05841v1</a></p>

<p>We study the left-right symmetric extension of the Standard Model (LRSM), featuring a TeV-scale right-handed (RH) gauge boson $W_R$ and three RH neutrinos. This setup naturally realises the type-II seesaw mechanism for active neutrino masses. We identify the conditions that yield sufficient entropy dilution to reconcile the keV sterile neutrino dark matter energy density with observations while inducing an early matter domination (EMD) phase. These constrain the lightest active neutrino mass to 8.59 x 10^{-10} eV &lt; m_{\nu_1} &lt; 5.06 x 10^{-9} eV$. The resulting frequency-dependent suppression of the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background is set by the mass and lifetime of the heavier RH neutrinos. Computing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for future detectors, we find that a blue-tilted primordial tensor spectrum can boost the GW signal to detectable levels (SNR &gt; 10) in experiments such as LISA, BBO, and DECIGO.</p>

<p>2025-10-06, <strong>Comment on âUnruh effect for neutrinos interacting with accelerated matterâ</strong>, R. R. S. Oliveira et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05403v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.05403v1</a></p>

<p>In the present comment, we show that the fundamental equation worked by Dvornikov in his paper, which is the Dirac equation for a massive neutrino interacting with linearly accelerated matter, is incorrect. In particular, Dvornikov incorrectly wrote/defined the effective external current in a curved space-time. In other words, Dvornikov wrote/defined such an effective current in a flat space-time, which is a mistake. Consequently, the second-order differential equation (generated through the quadratic Dirac equation) in your paper is incorrect, where such an equation is given by the Whittaker equation. So, since the solutions of such a differential equation (whose solutions are the Whittaker functions) are the basis for its results, it implies that such results are also incorrect. In this way, starting from the true/correct Dirac equation with an effective external current in a curved space-time, we obtain in detail the second-order differential equation (also a Whittaker equation) and its solutions for a neutrino interacting with linearly accelerated matter.</p>

<p>2025-10-06, <strong>Scalarized Hot Neutron Stars Containing Hyperons and $Î$-Resonances in Different Evolution Regimes</strong>, Fahimeh Rahimi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05302v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.05302v1</a></p>

<p>Scalar-tensor gravity models are among the prime candidates to explain cosmic acceleration, and compact stars provide unique laboratories for testing such theories. Predictions of scalar-tensor gravity in compact stars can be examined during the evolution of neutron stars. Spontaneous scalarization in relativistic stars is influenced by different properties of stellar matter in various evolution regimes. In the present study, we investigate the scalarization of neutron stars in different stages of the evolvement. For this aim, we apply the isentropic equations of state for the neutron star matter including nucleons, hyperons, and $\Delta$- resonances in neutrino-trapped, neutrino diffusion, and neutrino-transparent stages as well as cold-catalyzed neutron star. Our equations of state are based on the relativistic model within the mean-field approximation. To emphasize the role of scalar-tensor theories in exploring the properties and structure of compact stars, we calculate the structure of neutron stars with hyperons and $\Delta$-resonances in different snapshots of the neutron star evolution in the scalar-tensor gravity. Our calculations confirm that the neutron star scalarization is affected by the hyperons as well as the $\Delta$-resonances. Moreover, the properties of scalarized neutron stars depend on the stage of the star evolution.</p>

<p>2025-10-06, <strong>A comprehensive study of $Î_c^- \to Î(\to p Ï) Î¼^- \bar Î½_Î¼$ incorporating SMEFT implications and right-handed neutrino</strong>, Priyanka Boora et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05050v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.05050v1</a></p>

<p>Charm baryon decays provide a complementary probe of new physics beyond the Standard Model. We study the decay $\Lambda_c^- \to \Lambda (p \pi) \mu^- \bar \nu_{\mu}$ in a model-independent effective field theory framework. This study covers both the left-handed and right-handed neutrino interactions in the $c \to s \mu \nu_{\mu}$ transition. For the left-handed neutrino operators, we incorporate the implications of the Standard Model effective field theory and do a global fit considering several observables sensitive to these operators. Based on the allowed parameter space of the new-physics operators, we analyze the differential rates, forward-backward asymmetries, polarization asymmetries of the final-state hadron and lepton in $\Lambda_c^- \to \Lambda \mu^- \bar \nu_{\mu}$, and the angular coefficients in 4-body angular distribution of $\Lambda_c^- \to \Lambda (\to p \pi) \mu^- \bar \nu_{\mu}$. Our results highlight distinctive signatures of certain operators involving right-handed quark currents and provide predictions that can be tested at BESIII, Belle II, and LHCb.</p>

<p>2025-10-06, <strong>First Measurement of Neutrino Emissions from Spent Nuclear Fuel by the Double Chooz Experiment</strong>, Double Chooz Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04869v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.04869v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino emission from nuclear reactors provides real-time insights into reactor power and fuel evolution, with potential applications in monitoring and nuclear safeguards. Following reactor shutdown, a low-intensity flux of ``residual neutrinosââ persists due to the decay of long-lived fission isotopes in the partially burnt fuel remaining within the reactor cores and in spent nuclear fuel stored in nearby cooling pools. The Double Chooz experiment at the Chooz B nuclear power plant in France achieved the first quantitative measurement of this residual flux based on 17.2 days of reactor-off data. In the energy range where the residual signal is most pronounced, the neutrino detector located 400$\,$m from the cores recorded $106 \pm 18$ neutrino candidate events (5.9$\sigma$ significance). This measurement is in excellent agreement with the predicted value of $88 \pm 7$ events derived from detailed reactor simulations modeling the decay activities of fission products and incorporating the best-available models of neutrino spectra.</p>

<p>2025-10-06, <strong>One-Loop Effects in the Neutrino Matter Potential and Implications for Non-Standard Interactions</strong>, Jihong Huang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04841v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.04841v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we emphasize that it is necessary to take into account one-loop corrections of $2.0\%$ to the neutrino matter potential in the precision measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters and in the experimental searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. With the numerical simulation of the DUNE experiment, we study how radiative corrections to the matter potential affect neutrino oscillation probabilities, and thus, the event rates in the presence of neutrino non-standard interactions (NSIs). We find that neglecting one-loop corrections may lead to wrong conclusions for the discovery of NSIs. The implications for the determination of neutrino mass ordering and constraints on the NSI parameters in future long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments are explored in a quantitative way.</p>

<p>2025-10-06, <strong>Scattering of massive neutrino test fields from a gravitational pulse</strong>, Tekin Dereli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04687v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.04687v1</a></p>

<p>Linearized Einstein-Weyl equations are solved precisely in the context of sandwich gravitational waves. The neutrinoâs energy-momentum depends on the geometry and composition of the gravitational pulse when it is scattered. Since the background remains unchanged at the test field level, the neutrinoâs energy density will exhibit fluctuations between positive and negative extremes when traversing the sandwich wave. These variations could provide insights into the behavior of models concerning neutrino oscillations.</p>

<p>2025-10-06, <strong>Neutrinogenic CMB spectral distortions</strong>, Shao-Ping Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04684v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.04684v1</a></p>

<p>Extra radiation injection after neutrino decoupling in the early Universe contributes to the effective number of neutrino species that can be constrained by the cosmic microwave background (CMB). However, any effective neutrino number itself cannot uniquely determine the underlying source. We argue that the degeneracy can be relaxed by CMB spectral distortions, which are caused by energy exchange between the extra radiation and photons. We consider neutrinogenic CMB spectral distortions, where extra energy is released in the form of neutrinos but still creates the CMB spectral distortions via electroweak interactions. The synergy between the effective neutrino number and CMB spectral distortions provides a complementary probe of hidden sectors that dominantly couple to neutrinos, opening up parameter space that can be targeted by joint CMB anisotropy and spectral distortion experiments.</p>

<p>2025-10-06, <strong>Dirac neutrino and dark matter in left-right symmetric models</strong>, Shohei Okawa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04549v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.04549v1</a></p>

<p>We study neutrino mass generation and dark matter in a left-right symmetric model. The model is based on an $SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge theory with a softly broken parity symmetry. Masses of the charged leptons and neutrinos are generated radiatively at one-loop and three-loop level respectively, through their interactions with newly introduced neutral fermion and scalar particles. A mass hierarchy of those new particles is required to reproduce the observed patterns of the charged lepton spectrum and neutrino oscillation data. The resulting light particles, whose mass can be as light as GeV, serve as good dark matter candidates. The phenomenology of such dark matter candidates is governed by their interactions to left- or right-handed neutrinos. We study physics of dark matter with several benchmark parameter sets that reproduce the realistic neutrino mass matrix structure, and identify viable parameter spaces.</p>

<p>2025-10-07, <strong>Low-energy threshold demonstration for dark matter searches in TREX-DM with an $^{37}$Ar source produced at CNA HiSPANoS</strong>, J. Castel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05877v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.05877v1</a></p>

<p>We report on the successful implementation of an $^{37}$Ar calibration source in the TREX-DM detector, a high-pressure time projection chamber designed for low-mass dark matter searches. The $^{37}$Ar source was produced through fast neutron activation of CaO powder at the HiSPANoS facility of Centro Nacional de Aceleradores (CNA) in Spain, yielding $O(1)$ kBq of activity. Using a novel combined GEM-Micromegas readout system, we successfully detected both characteristic emissions from $^{37}$Ar decay (2.82 keV and 270 eV) and achieved unprecedented energy threshold performance in TREX-DM, approaching the single-electron ionization energy of argon.</p>

<p>2025-10-07, <strong>Constraints on dark matter models from the stellar cores observed in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies: Self-interacting dark matter</strong>, Jorge Sanchez Almeida et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05682v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.05682v1</a></p>

<p>It has been proposed that the stellar cores observed in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies reflect underlying dark matter (DM) cores that cannot be formed by stellar feedback acting on collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) halos. Assuming this claim is correct, we investigate the constraints that arise if such cores are produced by self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We derive the range of SIDM cross-sections (sigma/m) required to reproduce the observed core sizes. These can result from halos in either the core-formation phase (low sigma/m) or the core-collapse phase (high sigma/m), yielding a wide allowed range (sim 0.3 â 200 cm2/g) consistent with values reported in the literature for more massive galaxies. We also construct a simple model relating stellar mass to core radius - two observables likely connected in SIDM. This model reproduces the stellar core sizes and masses in UFDs with sigma/m consistent with those derived above. It also predicts a trend of increasing core radius with stellar mass, in agreement with observations of more massive dwarf galaxies. The model central DM densities match observations when assuming the SIDM profile to originate from an initial CDM halo that follows the mass-concentration relation. Since stellar feedback is insufficient to form cores in these galaxies, UFDs unbiasedly anchor sigma/m at low velocities. If the core-collapse scenario holds (i.e., high sigma/m), UFD halos are thermalized on kpc scales, approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the stellar cores. These large thermalization scales could potentially influence substructure formation in more massive systems.</p>

<p>2025-10-07, <strong>Self-Interacting Sub-GeV Dark Matter with Strong MeV Gamma-ray</strong>, Yu Watanabe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05630v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.05630v1</a></p>

<p>Sub-GeV dark matter (DM) with $s$-channel resonant self-scattering provides a promising framework for addressing small-scale structure problems. However, models that also account for the observed relic abundance through the same resonance are strongly constrained by current $\gamma$-ray observations, since the associated signals are significantly enhanced. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework in which the relic abundance and self-scattering are governed independently by two distinct mediators. As a concrete realization, we present a singlet scalar DM model in which self-scattering is mediated by a vector boson associated with a gauged baryon number, while the relic density is determined by forbidden annihilation into dark Higgs bosons that generate the gauge boson mass. By imposing cosmological, experimental, and theoretical constraints, We identify viable parameter regions that reproduce the observed relic density, alleviate small-scale problems, and remain consistent with current bounds. Notably, the model predicts multiple distinctive MeV $\gamma$-ray signals, a significant fraction of which will be testable with next-generation MeV $\gamma$-ray telescopes, including the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI).</p>

<p>2025-10-07, <strong>Demagnifying gravitational lenses as probes of dark matter structures and nonminimal couplings to gravity</strong>, Hong-Yi Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05575v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.05575v1</a></p>

<p>Magnification of total image fluxes is typically considered a defining feature of gravitational microlensing. In contrast, I will show that nonminimal couplings to gravity can generate regions of negative gravitational potential curvature, giving rise to the distinctive possibility of demagnification. Such events, appearing as flux troughs in microlensing light curves, provide a direct probe of dark matter structures and, crucially, offer a means to disentangle nonminimal couplings to gravity from other astrophysical and cosmological models.</p>

<p>2025-10-06, <strong>Self-interacting dark matter in the center of a Local Group dwarf galaxy and its satellites</strong>, Thales A. Gutcke et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05258v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.05258v1</a></p>

<p>We present a detailed comparison of a Local Group dwarf galaxy analogue evolved in two cosmological models: the standard $\Lambda$CDM and a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model with a velocity-dependent cross-section. Both simulations are run with the high-resolution, hydrodynamical LYRA galaxy formation model, allowing us to explore the global and substructure properties of the dwarf in a consistent context. While the overall halo growth, final mass, and subhalo mass functions remain largely unchanged across models, SIDM produces a central dark matter core extending to $\sim$1 kpc, which does not significantly vary with the inclusion of baryons. Baryonic properties, however, differ notably. The SIDM model leads to a 25% reduction in stellar mass and retains more gas within the stellar half-mass radius due to a prolonged quiescent phase in star formation. The stellar distribution is less centrally concentrated, and a population of in-situ star clusters form at late times. Substructure analysis reveals fewer luminous satellites and more stellar-only systems in SIDM, driven in part by tidal stripping that affects the dark matter more than the stars.

<p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) formed during first-order phase transitions provide a powerful link between the early-universe microphysics and observable signatures today, including dark matter and gravitational waves. In this work we develop a unified description of PBH formation based on the Israel junction conditions, which capture collapse dynamics without relying on conventional overdensity or pressure-balance arguments. As a first application, we show that exotic objects such as Fermi-balls can collapse into PBHs even when most of the vacuum energy is trapped in solitonic cores, leading to a different gravitational-wave signal relative to vacuum-only scenarios. As a second application, we study multiple phase transitions in a hidden sector, which generate correlated gravitational-wave spectra and PBH abundances across transitions. Our framework, while analytically controlled, is broadly applicable to hidden-sector models with general vacuum, radiation, and matter contributions. We present the resulting predictions for PBH mass spectra, dark matter fractions, and gravitational-wave signals, highlighting parameter regions that remain open in current searches and motivating future probes.</p>

<p>We assess the tension between DAMA/LIBRA and the latest dark matter annual modulation results from the ANAIS-112 and COSINE-100 NaI experiments, under a range of hypotheses ranging from physical to general parameterisations. We find that, in the most physically-motivated cases, the tension between DAMA and these other NaI experiments exceeds 5$\sigma$. Lowering the tension to reasonable values requires significant tuning, such as overfitting with large numbers of free parameters, and opposite-sign modulation between recoil signals on sodium versus iodine.</p>

<p>2025-10-06, <strong>Intrinsically Quantum Effects of Axion Dark Matter are Undetectable</strong>, Yunjia Bao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05198v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.05198v1</a></p>

<p>Is the usual treatment of axion dark matter as a classical field reliable? We show that the answer is subtle: the axion field could well be in a quantum state that has no complete classical description, but realistic detectors cannot tell the difference. To see this, we solve a fully quantum model of axion detection using quantum optics techniques. We show that intrinsically quantum effects are washed out by mode averaging or small amounts of noise, and significantly suppressed by the weakness of the axion coupling. Our work exemplifies that there should always be a classical analog for axion dark matter effects, extends to other wave (ultralight) dark-matter candidates, and gives a general method to compute the effects of exotic dark-matter states.</p>

<p>We study the impact of warm dark matter (WDM) particle mass on galaxy properties using 1,024 state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the DREAMS project. We begin by using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) coupled with a normalizing flow to explore global statistical descriptors of galaxy populations, such as the mean, standard deviation, and histograms of 14 galaxy properties. We find that subhalo gas mass is the most informative feature for constraining the WDM mass, achieving a determination coefficient of R^2 = 0.9. We employ symbolic regression to extract simple, interpretable relations with the WDM particle mass. Finally, we adopt a more localized approach by selecting individual dark matter halos and using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a normalizing flow to infer the WDM mass, incorporating subhalo properties as node features and global simulation statistics as graph-level features. The GNN approach yields only a residual improvement over MLP models based solely on global features, indicating that most of the predictive power resides in the global descriptors, with only marginal gains from halo-level information.</p>

<p>Dark Matter remains a great mystery in modern physics. Among various candidates, the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) scenario stands out and is under extensive study. The detection of the hypothetical gamma-ray emission from WIMP annihilation could act as a direct probe of electroweak-scale interactions, complementing DM collider searches and other direct DM detection techniques. At very high energies (VHE), WIMP self-annihilation is expected to produce gamma rays together with other Standard Model particles. The galactic center (GC), due to its relative proximity to the Earth and its high expected DM density, is a prime target for monoenergetic line searches. IACTs have placed strong constraints on the DM properties at the GC, with the MAGIC providing the most stringent limits from 20 TeV to 100 TeV, exploiting large zenith angle (LZA) observations. However, the limited field of view (FoV) of the MAGIC telescopes (&lt; 3.5{\deg} ) prevented a detailed study of the extended region around the GC in which an enhanced DM density is expected. The LST-1 of the CTAO, located at the Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain), close to the MAGIC site, has been observing the GC since 2021. With its wide FoV of 4.5{\deg}, LST-1 could contribute significantly to the WIMPs search at the GC. The observations are performed at LZA (ZA &gt; 58{\deg}), which, while required due to the sourceâs low altitude, also optimizes the detection of gamma rays up to 100 TeV and beyond. We present a study of the systematic uncertainties in WIMP line emission searches with LST-1. Our work examines the instrument response functions for LZA observations, background rejection in monoscopic mode, and includes updated results from simulations, highlighting new methods for spectral line searches.</p>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of unexpectedly massive and luminous galaxies at redshifts $z \gtrsim 7$, posing a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological paradigm. In this work, we address the tension between early JWST observations of luminous high-redshift galaxies and predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by revisiting the physics of dark matter halo formation. Employing refined halo mass functions derived by Del Popolo \textit{et al.} (DP1 and DP2) that incorporate angular momentum, dynamical friction, and redshift-dependent collapse barriers, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in the abundance of massive halos at $z \gtrsim 7$ compared to the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) formalism. Using a semi-empirical framework linking halo mass to UV luminosity, we show that the DP2 model reproduces the observed UV luminosity functions from $z = 7$ to $14$ with moderate star formation efficiencies, whereas the ST model requires implausibly high efficiencies. Our results suggest that the JWST overabundance problem stems not from new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, but from oversimplified treatments of gravitational collapse, highlighting the critical role of small-scale dissipative dynamics in early structure formation.</p>

<p>2025-10-06, <strong>Mixed WIMP-FIMP scenario in a two-component dark matter model</strong>, XinXin Qi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04610v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.04610v1</a></p>

<p>We consider the mixed WIMP-FIMP scenario in a two-component dark matter model with $Z_2 \times Z_4$ symmetry, where a singlet scalar $S$ and a Majarano fermion $\chi$ are introduced as dark matter candidates. We also introduce another singlet scalar $S_0$ with a non-zero vacuum expectation value to the SM so that the fermion dark matter can obtain mass after spontaneous symmetry breaking. Either $S$ or $\chi$ relic density can be generated via the âFreeze-outâ mechanism. In contrast, the other DM candidate relic density is obtained by the âFreeze-inâ mechanism, and we therefore have two different cases. In the case of $\chi$ as WIMP and $S$ as FIMP, we perform random scans to estimate the allowed parameter space consistent with the dark matter constraint. The results show that this case is viable over a wide range of dark matter masses with the Yukawa coupling of $S_0$ and $\chi$ should be larger than 1. Instead, for the case of $S$ as WIMP and $\chi$ as FIMP, the viable parameter space is more constrained by the direct detection experiements, and we have two regions with $m_S \approx 62.5$ GeV and $m_S&gt;400$ GeV under the constraints, which is consistent with the singlet scalar DM result but the scalar DM mass can be as low as a few hundred GeV for the heavy mass region in the model.</p>

<p>2025-10-06, <strong>Suzaku observations of outskirts of nearby clusters and groups: I. electron density and gas fraction to the virial radius</strong>, Kyoko Matsushita et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04523v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.04523v1</a></p>

<p>We present an analysis of Suzaku observations of 14 nearby galaxy clusters and groups (z &lt; 0.06), extending radial coverage out to the virial radius (approximately r200). The sample spans a wide mass range, from M500 about 2x10^13 to 7x10^14 solar masses, and includes well-studied systems such as Coma, Perseus, and Virgo. We carefully modeled all background components, including the soft X-ray foregrounds (the Local Hot Bubble, Milky Way Halo, and super-virial temperature components), the cosmic X-ray background, and the non-X-ray background, and assessed their effects on the derived properties of the intracluster medium (ICM). We constructed radial profiles of emission measure, electron density, and temperature. Temperatures decrease smoothly with radius, typically dropping to about one-third to half of their peak values near r200. For relaxed clusters, the emission measure profiles outside the core regions are well described by a beta model with beta around 0.6-0.7, while groups show slightly flatter slopes of beta around 0.4-0.65. Beyond r2500, electron density profiles follow a power-law decline with a slope close to 2. At r500 and r200, the electron density and the gas mass fraction show a tight correlation with the system mass, except for three clusters with bright subclusters. In massive clusters, the gas fraction increases with radius and approaches the cosmic baryon fraction near r200. In contrast, lower-mass systems exhibit gas fractions of around 0.1 at r200. The observed mass dependence of gas fractions suggests that feedback and related processes play an increasingly important role toward the group scale, shaping the connection between baryons and dark matter halos.</p>

<p>There is increasing observational evidence for a failed galaxy formation pathway for some ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) at low redshift however they currently lack simulated counterparts. We attempt to identify dark matter halos at high redshift within the MAGNETICUM cosmological simulations that could plausibly be their progenitors. We build a toy model of passive galaxy evolution within the stellar mass-halo mass relation to trace z = 0 observations of UDGs back to their z = 2 locations. We identify a population of 443 galaxies that match these parameter space positions within the simulation. We build two comparison samples within the simulation that follow the stellar mass-halo mass relationship at z = 2, one of which is stellar mass matched (with varying smaller halo masses) and the other is halo mass matched (with varying larger stellar masses) to our sample. We identify that our failed galaxy progenitor candidates have 1) flatter, cored dark matter halos; 2) more extended stellar bodies; 3) a larger fraction of their gas in the outskirts of their halos; 4) lower metallicities and 5) higher star formation rates than the control samples. Findings 1) and 2) are similar to low redshift observations of UDGs. Finding 3) will aid the removal of gas and permanent quenching of star formation which is a requirement of the failed galaxy formation scenario. The low metallicities of finding 4) match those observed in low redshift failed galaxy UDGs. Comparing the high star formation rates of finding 5) to recent JWST observations suggests that a starburst would naturally explain the high globular cluster richness of the UDGs. Many of the properties we find for these failed galaxy progenitors can be explained by an assembly bias of their dark matter halo to later formation times. We conclude by proposing that the fraction of failed galaxy UDGs is expected to increase with environmental density.</p>

<p>Star clusters host the massive stars responsible for feedback in star-forming galaxies. Stellar feedback shapes the interstellar medium (ISM), affecting the formation of future star clusters. To self-consistently capture the interplay between feedback and star formation, a model must resolve the parsec-scale star formation sites and the multiphase ISM. Additionally, the dynamical impact of cosmic rays (CRs) on star formation rates (SFRs) must also be considered. We present the first simulations of the formation of an ensemble of star clusters with dynamically-coupled CRs, near-individual star particles, and a feedback-regulated ISM. We analyze tallbox simulations performed using the CRISP model in the moving-mesh code AREPO. We apply varied implementations of CR transport under the theory of self-confinement. We find that CRs simultaneously reduce the SFR, the power law slope of the cluster mass function, and the cluster formation efficiency. Each simulation is compatible with observations, and CR feedback tends to move results along observed star cluster relations. We see only modest changes in cluster radius and velocity dispersions, but significant differences in the virial parameters. Ultimately, the primary impact of CRs is to reduce SFRs. Lower SFRs imply fewer supernovae, and consequently a lower turbulent energy budget for gas. Star clusters formed in a CR-regulated ISM have lower velocity dispersions, and are therefore more bound under self-gravity. The effective clustering of SNe is unchanged by CRs. Through this work, we demonstrate the predictive power of the CRISP feedback model, despite this idealized setup.</p>

<p>2025-10-07, <strong>The influence of rotation and metallicity on the explodability of massive stars</strong>, Renyu Luo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06043v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.06043v1</a></p>

<p>During the late stages of massive stellar evolution, failed supernovae (FSN) may form through core-collapse processes. The traditional evaluation criterion $\xi_{2.5}$ $=$ 0.45, primarily established using non-rotating progenitor models, suffers from significant inaccuracies when applied to rotating pre-supernova systems. The effects of metallicity and rotation on the explodability landscapes of massive stars lack robust quantification. We aim to investigate how rotation and metallicity influence the explodability of massive stars. We investigate how rotation and metallicity affect stellar explodability using MESA simulations with initial rotational velocities of $0$, $300$, and $600~\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$ at three metallicities ($Z_{\odot}$, $1/10,Z_{\odot}$, $1/50,Z_{\odot}$). Core-collapse phases are simulated with GR1D to determine critical heating efficiencies. Our results yield revised $\xi_{2.5}$ criteria: 0.45 for non-rotating models; 0.48 for $300~\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$; 0.47 for $600~\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$ at solar metallicity; and 0.59 for low-metallicity models. Chemically homogeneous evolution in rapidly rotating low-metallicity stars significantly raises the compactness limit for successful explosions and narrows the zero-age main sequence mass range for failed supernovae. Rotation substantially affects the explodability of low-metallicity massive stars, underscoring the importance of incorporating rotational effects in models of core-collapse supernova progenitors.</p>

<p>The abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor stars preserve a fossil record of the Universeâs earliest chemical enrichment by the supernova explosions from the evolution of first generation of stars, also referred to as Population III (or Pop III). By applying Bayesian inference to the analysis of abundance patterns of these ancient stars, this study presents a systematic investigation into the properties and explosion mechanism of Pop III stars. We apply NLTE corrections to enhance the reliability of abundance measurements, which significantly reduces the discrepancies in abundances between observations and theoretical yields for odd-Z elements, such as Na and Al. Our Bayesian framework also enables the incorporation of explodability and effectively mitigates biases introduced by varying resolutions across different supernova model grids. In addition to confirming a top-heavy ($\alpha=0.54$) initial mass function for massive Pop III stars, we derive a robust massâenergy relation ($E\propto M^2$) of the first supernovae. These findings demonstrate that stellar abundance analysis provides a powerful and independent approach for probing early supernova physics and the fundamental nature of the first stars.</p>

<p>2025-10-07, <strong>Luminosity distance dispersion in Swiss-cheese cosmology as a function of the hole size distribution</strong>, Thippayawis Cheunchitra et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05579v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.05579v1</a></p>

<p>The luminosity distance-redshift ($D_{\rm L}$â$z$) relation derived from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) yields evidence for a nonzero cosmological constant. SNe Ia analyses typically fit to the functional form $D_{\rm L}(z)$ derived theoretically from the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Yet, the metric in the epoch relevant to SNe Ia measurements deviates slightly from FLRW due to gravitational clumping of mass into large-scale structures like filaments and voids, whose sizes span many orders of magnitude. The small deviation is modeled typically by scalar perturbations to the FLRW metric. Each line of sight to a SNe Ia passes through a random sequence of structures, so $D_{\rm L}$ differs stochastically from one line of sight to the next. Here, we calculate the $D_{\rm L}$ dispersion in an exact Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi Swiss-cheese universe with a power-law hole size distribution, as a function of the lower cut-off $R_{\rm min}$ and logarithmic slope $\gamma$. We find that the standard deviation of $D_{\rm L}$ scales as $\sigma_{D_{\rm L}} \propto z^{2.25\pm0.01} (R_{\rm min}/24\pm1\,{\rm Mpc})^{(0.157\pm0.003)\left[\gamma - (1.16\pm0.02)\right]}$ for redshifts in the range $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.1$. The scaling shows that the $D_{\rm L}$ dispersion is dominated by a few large voids rather than the many small voids.</p>

<p>We present the analysis of the luminous Type II Supernova (SN) 2021tsz, which exploded in a low-luminosity galaxy. It reached a peak magnitude of -18.88 $\pm$ 0.13 mag in the $r$ band and exhibited an initial rapid decline of 4.05 $\pm$ 0.14 mag (100 d)$^{-1}$ from peak luminosity till $\sim$30 d. The photospheric phase is short, with the SN displaying bluer colours and a weak H$\alpha$ absorption componentâfeatures consistent with other luminous, short-photospheric phase Type II SNe. A distinct transition from the photospheric to the radioactive tail phase in the $V$ bandâas is common in hydrogen-rich Type II SNeâis not visible in SN 2021tsz, although a modest $\sim$1 mag drop is apparent in the redder filters. Hydrodynamic modelling suggests the luminosity is powered by ejecta-circumstellar material (CSM) interaction during the early phases (&lt;30 days). Interaction with 0.6 M$_\odot$ of dense CSM extending to 3100 R$_\odot$ reproduces the observed luminosity, with an explosion energy of 1.3$\times$10$^{51}$ erg. The modelling indicates a pre-SN mass of 9 M$_\odot$, which includes a hydrogen envelope of 4 M$_\odot$, and a radius of $\sim$1000 R$_\odot$. Spectral energy distribution analysis and strong-line diagnostics reveal that the host galaxy of SN 2021tsz is a low-metallicity, dwarf galaxy. The low-metallicity environment and the derived high mass loss from the hydrodynamical modelling strongly support a binary progenitor system for SN 2021tsz.</p>

<p>2025-10-06, <strong>Ionization Sources of the Local Interstellar Clouds: Two B-stars, Three White Dwarfs, and the Local Hot Bubble</strong>, J. Michael Shull et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05263v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.05263v1</a></p>

<p>The dominant sources of photoionizing radiation in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) incident on the exterior of the local interstellar clouds include two nearby early B-type stars, $\epsilon$ CMa ($124\pm2$ pc) and $\beta$ CMa ($151\pm5$ pc), three hot dwarfs, and the local hot bubble (LHB). Line emission (170-912A) from highly ionized metals (Fe, Ne, Mg) in million-degree LHB plasma may be responsible for the elevated ionization fractions of helium ($n_{\rm HeII}/n_{\rm He} \approx 0.4$) compared to hydrogen ($n_{\rm HII} / n_{\rm H} \approx 0.2$) in the local clouds. We update the stellar parameters and ionizing flux for $\beta$ CMa, after correcting the EUV spectra for intervening HI column density, $N_{\rm HI} = 1.9\pm0.1\times10^{18}~{\rm cm}^{-2}$, and its hotter effective temperature, $T_{\rm eff} \approx 25,000$K vs. 21,000K for $\epsilon$ CMa. These two stars produce a combined H-ionizing photon flux $\Phi_{\rm H} \approx 6800\pm1400$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at the external surface of the local clouds. The hot bubble could produce comparable fluxes, $\Phi_{\rm H} =$ 2000-9000 cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, depending on the amount of metal depletion into dust grains that survive sputtering. The radial velocities and proper motions of $\beta$ CMa and $\epsilon$ CMa indicate that both stars passed within $10\pm1$ pc of the Sun $4.4\pm0.1$ Myr ago, with 100-200 times higher local ionizing fluxes. At that time, the local clouds were likely farther from the Sun, owing to their transverse motion. Over the last few Myr, EUV radiation from these two stars left a wake of highly ionized gas in a hot, low-density cavity produced by past supernova explosions in the Sco-Cen OB association and connected with the LHB.</p>

<p>We study the stellar mass-iron metallicity relation of dwarf galaxies in the new high-resolution MEGATRON cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. These simulations model galaxy formation up to $z\approx8$ in a region that will collapse into a Milky-Way-like galaxy at $z=0$, while self-consistently tracking Population III and II (Pop.~III, Pop.~II) star formation, feedback and chemical enrichment. MEGATRON dwarf galaxies are in excellent agreement with the observed stellar mass-metallicity relation at $z=0$, including an over-abundance of dwarfs along a flat plateau in metallicity ($\langle [\rm{Fe}/\rm{H}] \rangle \approx -2.5$) at low stellar masses ($M_{\star} \leq 10^5 \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$). We tie this feature to the chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies by Pop.~III pair-instability supernova (PISN) explosions. The strong Lyman-Werner background (LW) from the protogalaxy ensures that PISNe occur in haloes massive enough ($\approx 10^7\, \rm{M}_{\odot}$) to retain their ejecta. We also predict a tail of $\approx 20\%$ of iron-deficient ($\langle [\rm{Fe}/\rm{H}] \rangle \leq - 3$) dwarf galaxies. We show that both plateau and tail (i) are robust to large variations in Pop.~II feedback assumptions, and (ii) survive in bound satellites surrounding the central galaxy at $z=0$.</p>

<p>Supernova remnants (SNRs) are the aftermath of massive stellar explosions or of a white dwarf in a binary system, representing critical phases in the life cycle of stars and playing an important role in galactic evolution. Physical properties of SNRs such as their shock velocity, density and age are important elements for constraining models for their evolution and understanding the physical processes responsible for their morphological appearance and emission processes. Our study provides, for the first time, a comprehensive statistical analysis of the physical parameters in 64 Galactic SNRs both as a population as well as regions within individual objects. These 64 objects represent the subset of the 310 known Galactic SNRs for which there are published optical data, from which we compiled their physical parameters through an exhaustive literature survey. Through a systematic statistical analysis accounting for uncertainties and/or upper and lower limits in these parameters we obtain distributions of the electron density and shock velocity in the studied SNRs and regions within them. This information is combined with constraints on their age and type. Analysis of electron density and shock velocity distributions for the entire sample of SNRs shows that they are consistent with a log-normal distribution and a skewed log-normal distribution, respectively. Within individual remnants, our study reveals that electron density and shock velocity show larger scatter in younger objects, reflecting the varying conditions of the ambient medium immediately surrounding the explosion epicenter and their impact on SNR evolution. Comparison of the dependence of the shock velocity and density on the supernova age with expectations from theoretical models shows good agreement.</p>

<p>The observational properties of core-collapse supernovae (CC-SNe) are shaped by the envelopes of their progenitors. In massive binary systems, mass-transfer alters the pre-SN structures compared to single stars, leading to a diversity in SN explosions. Aims. We compute the distribution of CC-SN properties based on comprehensive detailed grids of single and binary stellar evolution models. We conduct a grid-based population synthesis to produce a synthetic population of CC-SNe, and compare it to observed SN samples. We also apply various explodability and merger criteria to our models. In line with earlier results, we identify interacting SN progenitors as those stars that undergo CC during or shortly after a Roche-lobe overflow phase. With an interacting binary fraction of 68%, our models predict two-thirds of all CC-SNe to be of Type IIP/L, and 1/3 of Type Ibc, in agreement with recent volume-limited SN surveys. We find that 76% of the Type Ibc SN progenitors took part in a previous binary mass transfer (mostly as mass donor), but also 63% of the Type IIP/L SN progenitors (mostly as mass gainers), yielding a much broader envelope mass distribution than expected from single stars. We find that mass-transfer induced interacting SNe make up ~5% of all CC-SNe, which is close to the observed fractions of Type IIn and Type Ibn SNe. When assuming a disk or toroidal CSM geometry for Type IIn SNe, our models predict a bimodal distribution of the radiated energies, similar to that deduced from observations. While we find the effect of binary evolution on the relative number of Type Ibc and Type IIP/L SNe to be moderate, it leads to lower average ejecta masses in Type Ibc and Type IIb SNe, and can lead to higher pre-SN masses in Type IIP/L SNe than single stars. Binary models are also able to reproduce the number and properties of interacting SNe.</p>

<p>Over the past decades, there has been growing observational and theoretical evidence that cosmic-ray-induced instabilities play an important role in both acceleration and transport of cosmic rays (CRs). For instance, the efficient acceleration of charged particles at supernova remnant shocks requires rapidly growing instabilities, so much so that none of the proposed processes seem sufficient to warrant acceleration to PeV energies. In this work, we investigate whether an acoustic instability triggered by the presence of a CR pressure gradient can lead to significant self-confinement of charged particles in the vicinity of shocks. We validate the expected growth rates and obtain the scale and energy of magnetic field perturbations induced by such system using magnetohydrodynamical simulations. Our results suggest a strong suppression of the diffusion coefficient for particles with Larmor radius around a thousandth of the precursor scale length.</p>

<p>2025-10-06, <strong>The challenging first direct measurement of the 65 keV resonance strength in the $^{17}$O(p,$Î³$)$^{18}$F reaction at LUNA</strong>, D. Piatti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04597v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.04597v1</a></p>

<p>A precise determination of the proton capture rates on oxygen is mandatory to predict the abundance ratios of oxygen isotopes in a stellar environment where the hydrogen burning is active. The 17O(p,{\gamma})18F reaction, in particular, plays a crucial role in AGB nucleosynthesis as well as in explosive hydrogen burning occurring in novae and type I supernovae. At the temperature of interest for the former scenario (from 20 MK to 80 MK) the main contribution to the astrophysical reaction rate comes from the Er = 64.5 keV resonance. The strength of this resonance is presently determined only through indirect measurements, with an adopted value {\omega}{\gamma} = 16(3) peV. A new high sensitivity setup has been installed at LUNA, located at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. The underground location of LUNA 400kV guarantees a reduction of the cosmic ray background by several orders of magnitude. The residual background was further reduced by a dedicated shielding. On the other hand the 4{\pi}BGO detector efficiency was optimized installing an aluminum target chamber and holder. With about 400 C accumulated on Ta2O5 targets, highly enriched in 17O, the LUNA collaboration has performed the first ever direct measurement of the 64.5 keV resonance strength.</p>

<p>2025-10-06, <strong>Relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of supernova explosions within extragalactic jets</strong>, B. Longo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04570v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.04570v1</a></p>

<p>Jets in active galactic nuclei have to cross significant distances within their host galaxies, meeting large numbers of stars of different masses and evolution stages in their paths. Given enough time, supernova explosions within the jet will eventually happen, and may have a strong impact on its dynamics, potentially triggering powerful non-thermal activity. We carried out a detailed numerical study to explore the dynamics of the interaction between the ejecta of a supernova explosion and a relativistic extragalactic jet. By means of relativistic hydrodynamics simulations using the code RATPENAT, we simulated the jet-ejecta interaction in two different geometries or scenarios: a two-dimensional, axisymmetric simulation, and a three-dimensional one, which includes the orbital velocity of the exploding star. Although initially filling a region much smaller than the jet radius, the ejecta expands and eventually covers most of the jet cross section. The expansion is enhanced as more energy from the jet is converted into kinetic and internal energy of the ejecta, which also favors the ejecta disruption, all this occurring on timescales ~ 10^4 yr. Although a complete numerical convergence of the results is unattainable given the subsonic, turbulent nature of the interaction region, the simulations are consistent in their description of the gross morphological and dynamical properties of the interaction process. At the end of the simulations, the supernova ejecta has already partially mixed with the relativistic jet. The results also suggest that the jet-ejecta interaction may be a non-negligible non-thermal emitter. Moreover, due to efficient mixing, the interaction region can be a potential source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays of heavy composition.</p>

<p>2025-10-06, <strong>Latest view of CTA 1 with VERITAS</strong>, Alisha Chromey et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04414v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.04414v1</a></p>

<p>CTA 1 is a shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) with a central pulsar wind nebula (PWN), visible at very-high-energy (VHE) from 50 GeV to 100 TeV from a moderately extended emission region. While general consensus concludes the VHE emission originates from relativistic leptons accelerated by the PWN and undergoing inverse Compton scattering, questions remain about electron escape and propagation, as well as the evolutionary stage of this particular PWN. CTA 1 is on the cusp of middle age (~13 kyr) and spatially resolvable at energies visible to imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), such as the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) (PSF &lt; 0.1 deg). Therefore, this remnant is an excellent candidate to study lepton propagation and escape between different PWN evolutionary stages. Since the initial VERITAS publication on CTA 1 in 2013, VERITAS has performed new observations, adding to a total exposure of about 120 hours. We have analyzed the entire VERITAS CTA 1 dataset to date and report results.</p>
