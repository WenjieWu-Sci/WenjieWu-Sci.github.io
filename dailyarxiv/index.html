<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Towards the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND): the GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger prototypes</strong>, GRAND Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21306v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.21306v1</a></p>

<p>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a proposed multi-messenger observatory of ultra-high-energy (UHE) particles of cosmic origin. Its main goal is to find the long-sought origin of UHE cosmic rays by detecting large numbers of them and the secondary particles created by their interaction – gamma rays, and, especially, neutrinos. GRAND will do so using large arrays of radio antennas that look for the radio signals emitted by the air showers initiated by the interactions of the UHE particles in the atmosphere. Since 2023, three small-scale prototype GRAND arrays have been in operation: GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay in France, GRAND@Auger in Argentina, and GRANDProto300 in China. Together, their goal is to validate the detection principle of GRAND under prolonged field conditions, achieving efficient, autonomous radio-detection of air showers. We describe the hardware, software, layout, and operation of the GRAND prototypes and show the first radio spectra measured by them. Despite challenges, the successful operation of the prototypes confirms that the GRAND instrumentation is apt to address the goals of the experiment and lays the groundwork for its ensuing stages.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>First results from LEGEND-200 on the search for neutrinoless double beta decay</strong>, Giovanna Saleh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21166v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.21166v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) is a rare process which could take place if neutrinos are Majorana fermions: the observation of this decay would provide unambiguous evidence for the existence of new Physics beyond the Standard Model, as it entails a two-units lepton number violation. The LEGEND experiment (Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ Decay) searches for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ of $^{76}$Ge using High Purity Germanium detectors enriched in $^{76}$Ge beyond the 86%. The LEGEND project foresees two phases, LEGEND-200, aiming at a final 3$\sigma$ discovery sensitivity beyond 10$^{27}$ yr, and LEGEND-1000, aiming at a final sensitivity beyond 10$^{28}$ yr. LEGEND-200 started taking data in 2023 at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS): in about one year it collected a total physics exposure of 61 kg yr, with a background index of $0.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2} \cdot 10^{-3}$ counts/(keV kg yr) in the so-called “golden dataset” and of $1.3^{+0.8}_{-0.5} \cdot 10^{-3}$ counts/(keV kg yr) in the so-called “silver dataset”. The performed statistical analysis finds no evidence for a $0\nu\beta\beta$ signal and sets a lower limit on its half life to $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} &gt; 0.5 \cdot 10^{26}$ yr at 90% CL. A combined analysis of the three germanium-based $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments GERDA, MAJORANA Demonstrator and LEGEND-200 provides a lower limit of $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} &gt; 1.9 \cdot 10^{26}$ yr at 90% CL.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>High energy gammas and neutrinos from the Sun, Jupiter and Earth</strong>, Pablo de la Torre et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20970v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20970v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmic rays reaching the atmosphere of an astrophysical object produce showers of secondary particles that may then scape into space. Here we obtain the flux of gammas and neutrinos of energy $E&gt;10$ GeV emited by the Sun, Jupiter and Earth. We show that, while the solar magnetic field induces an albedo flux of gammas from all the points in the Sun’s surface, the dipolar magnetic field in the planets implies gammas only from the very peripheral region. Neutrinos, in contrast, can cross these objects and emerge from any point in their surface. The emission from these astrophysical objects is above the diffuse flux from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium and has a distinct spectrum and gamma to neutrino ratio.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Techniques for Continuous Wave Identification and Filtering in the Askaryan Radio Array</strong>, Mohammad Ful Hossain Seikh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20735v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20735v1</a></p>

<p>The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), located near the South Pole, is among the first experiments there designed to detect ultra-high energy neutrinos through the Askaryan effect. When such neutrinos interact in dense media like ice, they initiate particle cascades that generate coherent radio pulses. Operating in the 150-850 MHz band, ARA is deployed 80-200 meters deep in Antarctic ice, where the radio background is exceptionally low. Despite this, experiments such as ARA must still account for continuous wave (CW) signals, which can originate from anthropogenic sources, instrumental noise, and other environmental factors. These CW signals can obscure faint neutrino-induced pulses, complicating data analysis and event identification. Over the years, ARA has developed and refined techniques for CW filtering and identification, including spectral analysis, notch filtering, and phase-variance methods. These approaches exploit CW characteristics such as their narrowband nature and persistence to separate contamination from genuine impulsive events. We review the main CW identification and filtering techniques developed within the ARA collaboration and present recent improvements in adaptive, multi-stage filtering pipelines. These advances have led to faster processing, simpler operation, and more accurate CW suppression, improving data analysis quality. Their efficacy is demonstrated across all ARA stations, underscoring their role in reducing event misclassification and enhancing performance. By refining these techniques, this work not only improves the sensitivity of ARA but also highlights the importance of robust CW filtering for current and future neutrino radio detection experiments.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Reconciling the Tension Between Light Curve Modeling of Type II Supernovae and Neutrino-Driven Core-Collapse Supernovae Models with Late-Phase Spectroscopy</strong>, Qiliang Fang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20675v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20675v1</a></p>

<p>Type II supernovae (SNe II) are the most frequently observed outcome of core-collapse explosions and provide a valuable window into the physical mechanisms governing the deaths of massive stars. However, estimates of explosion properties based on optical light curve modeling often show tension with the predictions of modern neutrino-driven explosion models. In particular, when based on light curves from the explosions of red supergiant (RSG) tied to specific stellar wind models, many SNe II are found to originate from low-mass progenitors yet exhibit unusually high explosion energies ($E_{\rm K}$), far exceeding theoretical predictions. In this study, we incorporate late-phase (nebular) spectroscopy to estimate the helium core mass of the progenitor ($M_{\rm He\,core}$), which serves as an additional constraint to break degeneracies in light curve modeling. This approach is applied to a sample of 32 well-observed SNe II, using a light curve model grid constructed from RSGs with arbitrarily stripped hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than assuming a fixed wind model. Examining the resulting correlations among the physical parameters, we find that the tension between the observed $M_{\rm He\,core}$-$E_{\rm K}$ and $E_{\rm K}$-$M_{\rm Ni}$ relations and those predicted by neutrino-driven explosion models has significantly lessened by incorporating nebular spectroscopy in light curve modeling. This study highlights the crucial role of nebular spectroscopy in interpreting SNe II observations and provides support to the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism as the dominant engine powering these events.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Primordial black holes formation in inflationary $F(R)$ models with scalar fields</strong>, E. O. Pozdeeva et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21220v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.21220v1</a></p>

<p>We construct $F(R)$ gravity models with scalar fields to describe cosmological inflation and formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By adding the induced gravity term and the fourth-order polynomial potential for the scalar field to the known $F(R)$ gravity model, and using a conformal transformation of the metric, we obtain a two-field chiral cosmological model. For some values of the model parameters, we get that the inflationary parameters of this model are in good agreement with the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation obtained by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The estimation of PBH masses suggests that PBHs could be dark matter candidates.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Probing Light Dark Matter with Cosmic Gravitational Focusing</strong>, Shao-Feng Ge et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21213v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.21213v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the possibility of using the cosmic gravitational focusing (CGF) to probe the minor light dark matter (DM) component whose mass is in the range of $(0.1 \sim 100)$\,eV. Being a purely gravitational effect, the CGF offers a mode-independent probe that is complementary to the existing ways such as Lyman-$\alpha$ and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Such effect finally leads to a dipole density distribution that would affect the galaxy formation and hence can be reconstructed with galaxy surveys such as DESI. Both the free-streaming and clustering limits have been studied with analytical formulas while the region in between is bridged with interpolation. We show the projected sensitivity at DESI with the typical phase space distribution of a freeze-in DM scenario as illustration.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Gravitational waves from two scalar fields unifying the dark sector with inflation</strong>, Orlando Luongo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21200v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.21200v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the gravitational-wave background predicted by a two-scalar-field cosmological model that aims to unify primordial inflation with the dark sector, namely late-time dark energy and dark matter, in a single and self-consistent theoretical framework. The model is constructed from an action inspired by several extensions of general relativity and string-inspired scenarios and features a non-minimal interaction between the two scalar fields, while both remain minimally coupled to gravity. In this context, we derive the gravitational-wave energy spectrum over wavelengths ranging from today’s Hubble horizon to those at the end of inflation. We employ the continuous Bogoliubov coefficient formalism, originally introduced to describe particle creation in an expanding Universe, in analogy to the well-established mechanism of gravitational particle production and, in particular, generalized to gravitons. Using this method, which enables an accurate description of graviton creation across all cosmological epochs, we find that inflation provides the dominant gravitational-wave contribution, while subdominant features arise at the inflation-radiation, radiation-matter, and matter-dark energy transitions, i.e., epochs naturally encoded inside our scalar field picture. The resulting energy density spectrum is thus compared with the sensitivity curves of the planned next-generation ground- and space-based gravitational-wave observatories. The comparison identifies frequency bands where the predicted signal could be probed, providing those windows associated with potentially detectable signals, bounded by our analyses. Consequences of our recipe are thus compared with numerical outcomes and the corresponding physical properties discussed in detail.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Scalaron dark matter dynamics: effects of Higgs non-minimal coupling to gravity</strong>, Shibendu Gupta Choudhury et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21148v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.21148v1</a></p>

<p>One of the key features of the $R^2$-gravity is the embedding of a scalar field, scalaron, into the gravity sector. The scalaron interacts with the Standard Model (SM) matter fields through Planck-suppressed couplings. If the scalaron serves as a viable dark matter (DM) candidate, it can account for the lack of evidence of DM interactions beyond gravity in experimental and observational probes to date. The realization of the scalaron, as a cold DM candidate, depends on an induced trilinear interaction with the SM Higgs, despite its suppressed coupling strength. Here, we introduce a Higgs non-minimal coupling to gravity that additionally contributes to the induced trilinear interaction with its existing competing part, originated from the $R^2$-gravity. We study the interplay between these two contributions in the early universe, which determines both the initial conditions and evolution of the scalaron, leading to cold DM behavior at a later epoch. The trilinear interaction vanish identically for certain combinations of the Higgs non-minimal coupling and the scalaron mass, thereby setting the scalaron density through misalignment mechanism, similar to axions. Consequently, we find that the observed DM relic density is obtained for a scalaron mass between $1.38$ keV and $0.7$ MeV. The lower limit on the mass stems from the LHC constraints on the Higgs non-minimal coupling, whereas the upper bound arises from INTEGRAL/SPI limits on the excess gamma-ray flux from possible scalaron decays to two photons.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Muonium Spectroscopy as a Quantum Sensor for Ultralight Axion Dark Matter</strong>, Feng Fang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20862v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20862v1</a></p>

<p>High intensity muon beams open new avenues for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we propose a muonium-based experiment to search for ultralight axions dark matter through resonant quantum transitions between hyperfine states. Combining theoretical calculation with simulation results, we show that a muon beam with a realistic intensity of $10^5 \rm /s$ in the $\mathcal{O}(10~\text{keV})$ energy range could improve constraints on the axion-muon coupling by {up to seven orders of magnitude compared with existing muon $g-2$ limit, over the axion mass range $10^{-15}$ eV$-10^{-5}$ eV}. These results establish muonium spectroscopy currently under construction in Huizhou, as a powerful new probe of physics beyond the Standard Model.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>VERITAS Observations of the Microquasar SS 433</strong>, Tobias Kleiner et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21063v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.21063v1</a></p>

<p>Microquasars are increasingly recognized as efficient particle accelerators, potentially contributing to the cosmic-ray flux up to the “knee”. Among them, SS 433 stands out as a unique system with precessing relativistic jets embedded within the W50 supernova remnant. Recent detections of very- and ultra-high-energy gamma rays from SS 433 have solidified its role as a key laboratory for studying particle acceleration in jet-powered astrophysical sources. We present results from over 100 hours of observations of SS 433 with VERITAS, spanning more than a decade. These high-resolution measurements allow for a detailed morphological study of the eastern and western jet lobes with an angular resolution of &lt;0.1{\deg}. By analyzing the spatial and spectral characteristics of the gamma-ray emission, we investigate the particle acceleration mechanisms within the jets and at the jet-medium interaction in W50.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Galactic chemical evolution of short-lived radioactive isotopes produced by explosive nucleosynthesis: $^{60}$Fe and $^{53}$Mn</strong>, Thomas C. L. Truemam et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20956v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20956v1</a></p>

<p>Several short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) are know to have existed in the early Solar System (ESS). These species, which typically decay with half-lives of the order of a few million years, can be used to probe the timescale of events preceding the birth of the Sun. We investigate the ESS origin of $^{53}$Mn, produced by core-collapse (CCSNe) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and $^{60}$Fe, produced exclusively by CCSNe. We model the evolution of the radioactive-to-stable abundance ratios of these SLRs with a galactic chemical evolution (GCE) framework accounting for different supernova yields, SN Ia delay times, and other galactic features $(K)$. A further set of models are calculated assuming that SN Ia did not contribute any $^{53}$Mn to the ESS. The predicted ratios are compared to meteoritic ratios to derive a distribution of solar isolation times that includes uncertainties due to stochastic chemical enrichment and precision of the ESS values. The isolation times are then compared to those of $^{107}$Pd and $^{182}$Hf calculated in previous work. A self-consistent solution can be found within the current uncertainties, especially when using the GCE setups with $K = 1.6$ and 2.3, although the maximum likelihood for the \iso{60}Fe distribution is typically $\sim 4-5$ Myr shorter than for \iso{53}Mn. The predicted \iso{60}Fe/\iso{53}Mn ratio, instead, is completely inconsistent with the ESS value; this could be resolved using a larger fraction of faint CCSNe than usually considered in GCE models.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>The Extended Stellar Distribution in the Outskirts of the Ursa Minor Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy</strong>, Kyosuke S. Sato et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20914v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20914v1</a></p>

<p>We discover an extended distribution of main-sequence (MS) stars along the minor axis of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). This study is enabled by deep, wide Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam data, reaching photometric uncertainties below 0.1 mag at $g,i \sim 26$ mag. Color-magnitude diagrams along the major and minor axes reveal a clear excess of MS stars beyond the nominal tidal radius along the minor axis. To characterize this structure, we derive radial number density profiles in seven azimuthal directions and fit them with an exponential+power-law function to assess the symmetry of the extended component. The power-law slopes tend to be shallower toward the minor axis, though the symmetry remains inconclusive within 1$\sigma$ uncertainties. This may indicate that the extended component is preferentially distributed along the minor axis, and could be different from the previously suggested tidal features along the major axis. Comparing with simulations, we find that the fraction of stars beyond five effective radii is consistent with expectations from an intermediate mass ratio merger scenario with a stellar mass ratio around 6:1. While these findings provide new insights into the structural complexity and dynamical history of the UMi dSph, alternative mechanisms such as stellar or supernova feedback have also been proposed for extended stellar halos in dwarfs and cannot be ruled out.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Probing redshift-dependent systematics in the Hubble tension: Model-independent $H_0$ constraints from DESI R2</strong>, Tonghua Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20898v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20898v1</a></p>

<p>We present a model-independent determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) using the latest observational data from multiple cosmological probes. By combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the second data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR2), cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and the Pantheon Plus Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample, we reconstruct the cosmic expansion history through Gaussian process regression without assuming a specific cosmological model or relying on sound horizon calibration. Our analysis incorporates the complete covariance structure of the measurements and yields $H_0$ constraints at five distinct redshifts: $65.72 \pm 1.99$ (z=0.51), $67.78 \pm 1.75$ (z=0.706), $70.74 \pm 1.39$ (z=0.934), $71.04 \pm 1.93$ (z=1.321), and $68.37 \pm 3.95~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ (z=1.484). The optimal combination of these measurements gives $\hat{H}_0 = 69.0 \pm 1.0~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ with 1.4\% precision, which occupies an intermediate position between the Planck CMB result and the SH0ES local measurement and is consistent with the TRGB result. Rather than providing a single integrated $H_0$ value, our approach delivers independent constraints at multiple redshifts, thereby enabling a detailed investigation of potential redshift-dependent systematic effects that could contribute to the Hubble tension. We identify significant correlations between adjacent redshift bins ($\rho = -0.033$ to $0.26$), primarily arising from the BAO covariance and reconstruction effects. These results demonstrate a clear redshift evolution in Hubble constant measurements and suggest that the Hubble tension may involve more complex redshift-dependent effects than a simple dichotomy between early and late universe probes.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Hybrid Strategy for Coordinated Interstellar Signaling: Linking the Galactic Center and Extragalactic Bursts</strong>, Naoki Seto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20718v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20718v1</a></p>

<p>The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is largely limited by the vastness of the signaling parameter space. The concurrent signaling scheme offers a framework in which civilizations can coordinate their transmission and reception by referring to a common astrophysical event. Building on this idea, I propose a hybrid strategy that combines the Galactic Center as a spatial reference with an extragalactic burst as a temporal marker. If such a scheme is indeed employed, the sky area to be surveyed in SETI could be reduced by more than two orders of magnitude, based solely on existing astronomical data. I examine records of three types of extragalactic bursts (supernovae, neutron star mergers, and gamma-ray bursts [GRBs]) to identify suitable temporal markers. Among them, GRB 221009A is particularly notable due to its high fluence and favorable sky location.</p>
