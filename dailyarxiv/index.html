<p>2026-02-17, <strong>Detecting the neutrino mass via the cross-correlation between matter tracers and the ISWRS effect?</strong>, Viviana Cuozzo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15688v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15688v1</a></p>

<p>This work explores the potential to detect the nonlinear Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect, namely the Rees-Sciama effect (ISWRS), by cross-correlating current and future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments – Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, CMB-HD, and PICO – with ongoing Large Scale Structure (LSS) surveys, such as Euclid and the Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST). We model the cross-correlation of the ISWRS effect with gravitational potential tracers like galaxy clustering, cosmic shear, and CMB-lensing potential, to forecast results from these experiments. Our analysis also accounts for the presence of massive neutrinos to assess the feasibility of identifying the $ν\(Λ$CDM model and constraining the neutrino mass sum, M$ν$. Our findings indicate that the CMB-lensing potential reconstructed by CMB-HD is expected to provide the most promising results, achieving $\gtrsim$ 5$σ$ detections even under conservative assumptions for detector noise and foregrounds, thereby allowing differentiation between $ν\)Λ$CDM models. Galaxy clustering can also yield significant detections, whereas cosmic shear can provide valuable results only if non-linearities are accurately modelled, beyond the capabilities of currently available analytical approaches. These latter LSS probes do not provide strong constraining power on M$ν$. While our findings suggest that future CMB experiments and LSS surveys will enable the detection of the ISWRS effect, they do not imply significant prospects for imposing new constraints on neutrino masses in the near future.</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>The COHERENT Experiment: 2026 Update</strong>, M. Adhikari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15652v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15652v1</a></p>

<p>The COHERENT experiment measures neutrino-induced recoils from coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) with multiple nuclear targets at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), USA. Several successful CEvNS measurements have been achieved in recent years with tens-of-kg detector masses, with a CsI scintillating crystal, a liquid argon single-phase detector, and high-purity germanium spectrometers. For the next phase, COHERENT aims at high-statistics detection of CEvNS events for precision tests of the standard model of particle physics, and to probe new physics beyond-the-standard model. Percent-level precision can be achieved by lowering thresholds, reducing backgrounds, and by scaling up the detector masses. It goes hand in hand with benchmarking the neutrino flux from the SNS. Further detectors will measure CEvNS in additional nuclei, including lighter target nuclei such as sodium and neon, to continue to test the expected neutron-number-squared dependence of the cross section. COHERENT can furthermore study charged-current and neutral-current inelastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections on various nuclei at neutrino energies below $\sim$50 MeV. Many of these cross sections have never been measured before, but are critical input for the interpretation of core-collapse supernova detection in large-scale neutrino experiments such as DUNE, Super-K, Hyper-K, and HALO.</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>Bayesian parameter study of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 7469</strong>, Björn Eichmann et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15644v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15644v1</a></p>

<p>Multimessenger observation of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 7469 indicate a characteristic feature in the radio band (the so-called mm-bump) as well as indication of high-energy neutrinos by the AGN corona. Moreover, also the starburst ring of these sources is bright in the radio and hence, a potential source of $γ$-rays and neutrinos.   We aim to explain the non-thermal features of these two sources with our homogeneous steady-state Seyfert-starburst composite model, which we refined in this work. Hereby, we account for stochastic diffuse acceleration and energy losses within the corona and $γγ$-pair attenuation of the escaping $γ$-rays. Since the non-thermal features of Seyfert sources contribute only marginally to the electromagnetic spectrum, only few data points can be assigned to the starburst ring or the AGN corona. Hence, prior information on the physical parameters is incorporated within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to avoid overfitting.   Based on this Bayesian parameter study we show, that the non-thermal features of NGC 1068 can be explained well. Still a more detailed treatment of the spatial inhomogeneities in the central region of the AGN could further improve the fit results. This manifests itself even more clearly in the case of NGC 7469, where the mm-bump needs to emerge from a coronal size $R_{\rm c}&gt;100\,\mathcal{R}_{\rm s}$, whereas (TeV-PeV)-neutrino emission requires $R_{\rm c}&lt; 10\,\mathcal{R}_{\rm s}$. Similar to what has previously been shown in other wavebands, our analysis highlights that the spatial extension of the so-called AGN corona depends the considered energy of the messenger. Hence, it seems that there is not a unique edge of the corona and a substantial progress in the understanding of these phenomena is expected if future analysis account for these spatial inhomogeneities.</p>

<p>2026-02-16, <strong>Detection horizon for the neutrino burst from the stellar helium flash</strong>, Pablo Martínez-Miravé et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15119v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15119v1</a></p>

<p>Low-mass stars ($M\lesssim 2\,M_\odot$) ignite helium under degenerate conditions, eventually causing a nuclear run-away – the helium flash. The alpha-capture process on $^{14}$N produces a large amount of $^{18}$F, whose subsequent decay spawns an intense $ν_e$ burst (with average energy of $0.38$ MeV) lasting about a day. We show that, in addition, a strong $1.7$ MeV neutrino line is generated by electron capture on $^{18}$F. Detection is hindered by large backgrounds in state-of-the-art neutrino observatories, such as JUNO. In next-generation facilities, such as the Jinping neutrino experiment, the horizon for a detection with a local significance of $3 σ$ would be extended to almost $3$ pc. Although helium flashes occur a few times per year in our Galaxy, there are no stellar candidates approaching the tip of the red giant branch within $10$ pc. Hence, to date, asteroseismology remains the most promising tool for probing the most energetic thermonuclear event in the life of a low-mass star.</p>

<p>2026-02-16, <strong>The Sun Can Strongly Constrain Spin-Dependent Dark Matter Nucleon Scattering Below the Evaporation Limit</strong>, Thong T. Q. Nguyen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15113v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15113v1</a></p>

<p>The Sun is a promising target for dark matter searches due to its ability to accumulate dark matter particles via scattering and catalyze their self-annihilation. However, at low dark matter masses, dark matter particles can also “evaporate” due to subsequent collisions with the hot thermal plasma of the Sun. While several modeling studies have calculated the competitive dynamics of dark matter evaporation and annihilation, observational studies have typically assumed a fixed 4 GeV “evaporation limit”, below which dark matter evaporates before it can annihilate. In this paper, we carefully consider the competitive effects of dark matter evaporation and annihilation on the resulting spin-dependent dark matter nucleon cross-section limits, finding that Solar observations can continue to exceed terrestrial constraints by between 1-5 orders of magnitude for dark matter masses between 2-4 GeV for dark matter annihilation to both neutrinos and long-lived mediators.</p>

<p>2026-02-16, <strong>ABCMB: A Python+JAX Package for the Cosmic Microwave Background Power Spectrum</strong>, Zilu Zhou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15104v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15104v1</a></p>

<p>We present ABCMB, a differentiable Einstein-Boltzmann solver for the cosmic microwave background (CMB). ABCMB is a complete code capturing important effects to linear order in $Λ{\rm CDM}$ cosmology. It computes the CMB power spectrum and includes effects like lensing, polarization, massive neutrinos, and a state-of-the-art treatment of BBN and recombination. ABCMB has sub-percent-level agreement with CLASS and can be run on a GPU with competitive, and sometimes even faster, run times. It is refactored compared to previous codes and takes advantage of object-oriented programming to improve extensibility, meaning new physics can be added to it without the need for modifying source files. ABCMB provides accurate and stable gradients to the user, making Fisher analyses straightforward, and enabling the use of efficient gradient-based sampling methods.</p>

<p>2026-02-16, <strong>Dominant One-Loop Seesaw Contribution Induced by Non-Invertible Fusion Algebra</strong>, Monal Kashav et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14644v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.14644v1</a></p>

<p>The topological classification of the one-loop Weinberg operator at dimension-5 enables a systematic categorization of radiative neutrino mass models. Among these, the category consisting loop-extended seesaw frameworks is theoretically appealing but conventional discrete or continuous symmetries (\emph{e.g.}, $U(1)$ or $\mathbb{Z}_M$) cannot genuinely forbid the corresponding tree-level contributions, making loop dominance difficult to realize. We show that \textit{non-invertible selection rules} (NISRs) naturally enforce the absence of tree-level terms while ensuring a dominant one-loop contribution. Intriguingly, the same non-invertible structure also stabilizes the dark matter candidate, providing a unified radiative origin of neutrino mass and dark sector stability. In particular, we focus on the T4-2-$i$ topology which embodies a type-II one-loop seesaw and demonstrate its natural realization from $Z_{7}$ Tambara–Yamagami (TY) fusion algebra.</p>

<p>2026-02-16, <strong>Rephasing invariant structure of CP phase for simplified mixing matrices in Fritzsch–Xing parametrization</strong>, Masaki J. S. Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14513v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.14513v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we construct an explicit rephasing transformation that converts an arbitrary unitary mixing matrix into the Fritzsch–Xing (FX) parametrization, which is obtained by trivializing arguments of the matrix elements in the third row and third column. We further analyzed the rephasing invariant structure of the FX phase $δ_{\rm FX}$ under the approximation where the 1-3 element of the diagonalization matrix of charged leptons $U^{e}$ is neglected, $U_{13}^{e} = 0$. As a result, in the limit where the 1-3 element of diagonalization of neutrinos $U^ν$ is also neglected,   we obtained a compact expression for the FX phase $δ_{\rm FX} = \arg [ { U^{e}_{11} U^{e}_{12} U^{e}_{33} } { U^{ν<em>}_{11} U^{ν</em>}_{12} U^{ν<em>}_{33} / \det U^{e} \det U^{ν</em>} } ] - \arg [ 1 + ({U^{e *}_{23} U^ν_{23} / U^{e *}_{33} U^ν_{33}} ) ] $. In this limit, the FX phase is controlled by two independent relative phases between $U^{ν, e}$, and the FX phase for finite $U_{13}^ν$ is understood as a generalization to the compact expression.</p>

<p>2026-02-16, <strong>Search for Cosmic-Ray Produced Dark Meson via the $U(1)_\text{D}$ Portal at JUNO</strong>, Zirong Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14355v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.14355v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the atmospheric production and subsequent detection of sub-GeV dark mesons within the framework of a confining dark sector coupled to the Standard Model (SM) via a $U(1)_{\text{D}}$ vector portal. High-energy cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere produce dark quarks through proton bremsstrahlung, rare decay of Standard Model mesons, and Drell-Yan processes, which subsequently hadronize into dark mesons. We adopt a modified Quark Combination Model to describe the non-perturbative dark hadronization process, allowing for a detailed event-level characterization of the dark meson flux. We simulate the flux and the interaction of these relativistic dark mesons in the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) using the GENIE generator, considering both elastic scattering off nuclei and deep inelastic scattering channels. Based on the projected 20 kton$\cdot$year exposure, we derive sensitivity limits on the coupling strength between the dark gauge boson and the SM sector. Our results demonstrate that JUNO can probe substantial unexplored parameter space, particularly for light mediators ($m_{Z^\prime} \lesssim 10$ MeV), where it achieves sensitivities to the portal interaction as low as $2.4 \times 10^{-4}$.</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>Searching for Axion-like particle Dark Matter with Time-domain Polarization: Constraints from a protoplanetary disk</strong>, Kanako Narita et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15611v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15611v1</a></p>

<p>Axion-like particles (ALPs) can induce a birefringence effect that rotates the polarization angle of light, offering a probe of ultralight dark matter. We analyze archival near-infrared polarimetric data of the protoplanetary disk (PPD) around HD 163296. Whereas previous studies considered only single-epoch snapshots, we perform a consistent multi-epoch time-series analysis, extracting the polarization angle and its uncertainty from the polarized images. The resulting six-epoch time series is consistent with a constant polarization angle within the measurement uncertainties, while being sensitive to timescales of $\sim 170-400$ days. The typical polarization angle uncertainties are $1.6$–$6.4$ degrees, partly driven by multiple scattering in the optically thick disk, which broadens the intrinsic polarization angle distribution and introduces additional dispersion in the representative polarization angle. Based on these data, we derive the first upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling from PPD polarization variability, $g_{aγ} \lesssim 7.5 \times 10^{-12} (m_a / 10^{-22}\,{\rm eV})\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$. Furthermore, we forecast that achieving a polarization angle uncertainty of $σ\sim 0.1$ degrees would enable world-leading sensitivity to ALP-induced birefringence.</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>Particle production, absorption, scattering, and geodesics in a Schwarzschild–Hernquist black hole</strong>, N. Heidari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15420v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15420v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate quantum and classical signatures of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a Hernquist dark matter halo. Starting from the exact spherically symmetric solution describing this composite system, we analyze particle production for both bosonic and fermionic fields using semiclassical techniques. Hawking radiation is derived through Bogoliubov transformations and independently via the tunneling method with energy conservation, allowing us to identify the effective temperature, emission spectrum, and the role of dark matter parameters in suppressing particle creation. The evaporation process is examined in the high-frequency regime, leading to modified evaporation times and emission rates relative to the vacuum Schwarzschild case. We further study absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves employing a partial-wave analysis, computing phase shifts, partial and total cross sections, and assessing the impact of the Hernquist scale radius and density on these observables. Finally, null and timelike geodesics are explored to characterize light propagation and particle motion in the presence of the dark matter halo.</p>

<p>2026-02-16, <strong>Understanding the Quantized Angular Momentum of Rotating Q-balls</strong>, Benjamin DeVries et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15196v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15196v1</a></p>

<p>Non-topological solitons, such as Q-balls, may contribute to the cosmological dark matter. The formation and evolution of Q-balls in the early universe requires an understanding of solitons with nonzero angular momentum. We derive (rather than assume) the schematic form of the scalar field configurations that produce rotating Q-balls, which produce their well known quantized angular momentum. This analysis leads to additional insight into the properties of these rotating solitons, including a method for computing their characteristic angular velocity. By considering rotating solitons in two spatial dimensions, we investigate these attributes concretely. We develop analytical approximations for the solitons and their defining quantities. We show that they agree with numerical results and exhibit the general properties of rotating solitons.</p>

<p>2026-02-16, <strong>Enhanced Cosmic-Ray Antinuclei Fluxes with Dark Matter Annihilation into SUEPs</strong>, Mattia Di Mauro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15132v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15132v1</a></p>

<p>Standard-Model (SM) hadronic parton showers initiated by secondary cosmic-ray production or dark matter (DM) annihilations robustly predict very low antinuclei yields and a strong additional suppression for heavier antinuclei. We show that an important exception can arise if DM annihilates into a confining dark sector that produces Soft Unclustered Energy Patterns (SUEPs). The hallmark of SUEPs is the emission of very large multiplicities of soft dark mesons ($π_D$), which can overcome the usual phase-space suppression of antinuclei formation in parton showers, provided that the dark mesons decay promptly into SM quarks, i.e. within a SM hadronization length. We study several benchmark realizations and find that for DM masses $m_{\rm DM}\sim\mathcal{O}(10~\mathrm{TeV})$, dark meson masses $m_{π_D} \sim 400~\mathrm{GeV}$, $π_D$ dominantly decaying to $t\bar t$, and a SUEP temperature $T_{\rm SUEP}\simeq 0.1\,m_{πD}$, DM annihilation into SUEPs can yield tens of antideuterons and a few antihelium–3 events at AMS-02 at kinetic energies of $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{GeV}$/n) and a few antideuterons and antihelium-3 events in GAPS at energies below 0.5 GeV/n. A future confirmation of an antinuclei signal by the AMS-02 or GAPS experiments could provide hints for hidden confining dynamics and would significantly constrain the relevant SUEP parameters.</p>

<p>2026-02-16, <strong>Prospects of Indirect Detection of Dark Matter via Primordial Black Hole Induced Gravitational Waves</strong>, Debarun Paul et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15026v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15026v1</a></p>

<p>Primordial black holes (PBHs), produced in the early Universe, can source a stochastic background of induced gravitational waves (GWs) and provide a non-thermal origin for dark matter (DM). We investigate DM production in a PBH-dominated cosmological framework, including contributions from PBH evaporation, gravitational production, and thermal freeze-in and freeze-out mechanisms, and determine the regions consistent with the observed DM relic abundance. We find that thermal freeze-in can compensate for the underabundance of PBH-sourced DM, while indirect detection remains largely insensitive due to the feeble interaction strength, making future GW observatories such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope (ET) unique probes of this scenario. For freeze-out DM, indirect detection experiments constrain regions with relatively large annihilation cross-sections, whereas GW observations probe complementary regions with heavier DM masses and smaller interaction strengths. Consequently, the same DM parameter space cannot be simultaneously probed by both indirect detection searches and GW missions. These results establish GW observations as a powerful and independent probe of DM production in PBH-dominated cosmologies, opening a new observational window into DM properties and the thermal history of the pre-BBN Universe.</p>

<p>Searches for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds from first-order phase transitions offer a powerful probe of hidden sectors, but quantitative predictions in gauge theories are obstructed by the gauge dependence of the finite-temperature effective potential and the associated tunneling action. We study a minimal gauged $U(1)$ dark sector containing a dark Higgs and a dark photon, optionally supplemented by a vectorlike dark fermion, coupled to the Standard Model through Higgs portal or kinetic mixing. Using the Nielsen identity together with a controlled derivative expansion and power counting, we construct a gauge-independent effective action in the high- and low-temperature limits, enabling model-intrinsic nucleation dynamics and robust gravitational wave predictions. We perform dedicated Monte Carlo scans in both limits and map viable microscopic parameters to detector-facing peak frequencies and amplitudes, spanning bands relevant to pulsar timing arrays and planned space-based interferometers. In our scans, supercooled transitions typically produce the strongest signals, whereas parametrically high-temperature transitions are comparatively rare and tend to be weak. We further connect the phase transition phenomenology to viable dark matter candidates within the same minimal field content, providing benchmark targets for dark photon dark matter and dark fermion dark matter, and highlighting their complementarity with gravitational wave observables. Overall, our results provide an end-to-end, gauge-independent pipeline from a minimal hidden sector Lagrangian to gravitational wave spectra and cosmologically viable dark matter benchmarks, yielding the most reliable and concrete predictions to date for a minimal gauged $U(1)$ dark sector.</p>

<p>2026-02-16, <strong>Exploring Non-minimal coupling using ultra-diffuse galaxies</strong>, Saboura Zamani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14747v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.14747v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate whether a non-minimal coupling between dark matter and gravity can influence the internal dynamics of ultra-diffuse galaxies. Within this framework, the gravitational potential is modified by an additional term that captures the interaction between spacetime curvature and the dark matter with a coupling constant determined by a length scale $L$. Using spherical Jeans modeling, we analyze the kinematic data of three ultra-diffuse galaxies namely: NGC\;1052-DF2, NGC\;1052-DF4, and Dragonfly\;44, which span the observational extremes from dark matter deficient to dark matter dominated systems. For each galaxy we explore several dark matter halo profiles, two orbital anisotropy models, and both with and without Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation scenarios, and we perform a Bayesian parameter inference. Our results show that across all the considered configurations, the constrained astrophysical parameters are consistent with standard ones from General Relativity. The posterior distributions of $L$ show no preference for non-zero values and result only in upper limits, suggesting that any non-minimal coupling contribution must be small and perturbative on this scales. Future high precision velocity measurements will be essential to determine whether non-minimal coupling effects can become observationally distinguishable in low-acceleration systems.</p>

<p>The ReD experiment measured the ionization yield Qy of argon for nuclear recoils in the 2-10 keV range using a dual-phase Time Projection Chamber irradiated with neutrons from a Cf-252 fission source. The measurement extends coverage below 7 keV, confirms consistency with previous data above 7 keV, and indicates a higher Qy at lower energies. These results are relevant for argon-based experiments searching for dark matter in the form of low-mass Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, which are very sensitive to the modeling of the detector response in this energy range.</p>

<p>2026-02-16, <strong>Back to Normal Again: Possible Destinies of JWST overmassive SMBHs and “Little Red Dots” in the View of Shin-Uchuu Simulation</strong>, Haojie Hu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14496v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.14496v1</a></p>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled the discovery of hundreds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at redshifts $z\gtrsim 4-7$. A non-negligible fraction of these SMBHs are hosted in galaxies with BH-to-galaxy mass ratios ($M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$) being excessively larger than that for local SMBHs by $\sim 1-2$ dex. The origin of these <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">overmassive'' BHs remains elusive, demanding either a heavy seed formation scenario or rapid growth of seed BHs. Their deviation from local scaling relations challenges our understanding of how SMBHs and their host galaxies coevolve across cosmic time. In this paper, we apply phenomenological modelings for BHs and galaxies to dark matter halo merger histories from N-body simulations to investigate the subsequent evolution of JWST-discovered</code>overmassive’’ SMBHs. We find that early evolution of ``overmassive’’ SMBHs is dominated by stunted accretion leading to gradual decreases in $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios. In contrast, less massive SMBHs experience super-Eddington accretion during their early evolution, resulting in a slow increase of mass ratios toward $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star \sim 0.01$. Convergence occurs at $M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^8~M_\odot$ with $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star \sim 0.01$. At lower redshift, nearly all SMBHs evolve onto local relations, as expected given that our models adopt empirical relations derived from low-redshift observations. This suggests that the global feedback mechanisms regulating the coevolution of $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios are implicitly encoded in local relations in terms of star-formation rate distribution, black hole accretion rate distribution and their active (quiescent) fractions.</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>Between Plateaus and Slopes: A Data-Driven Exploration of Spectral Diversity Across Type IIP/L Supernovae</strong>, Géza Csörnyei et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15788v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15788v1</a></p>

<p>Type II supernovae (SNe II) have been traditionally separated into several subgroups based on their photometric and spectroscopic properties, but whether these represent distinct progenitors or a continuous distribution remains debated. Over the past decade, growing observational evidence has suggested a possible continuity between slow- (IIP) and fast-declining (IIL) SNe. We investigate the continuity of the SNe IIP/L subclasses through a data-driven statistical analysis of spectral time series, aiming to determine whether significant correlations exist between overall spectral shapes and light-curve decline rates. We introduce a novel standardization method for SN II spectra. After empirically flattening the spectra via continuum normalization, we interpolate the resulting “feature spectra” onto a fixed grid of epochs using Gaussian Process regression. The interpolated spectra are then analyzed using Principal Component Analysis to explore correlations. We find that SNe IIP and IIL form a continuum spectroscopically, though some clustering remains. The spectral diversity is characterized mainly by two components: one continuous group with well-defined P-Cygni profiles and another with “less-regular” features likely driven by enhanced circumstellar material (CSM) interaction. Our results reveal that the spectral diversity of SNe IIP/L diminishes over time. We confirm observational correlations: steeper light-curve declines correspond to weaker spectral features, indicating that SNe IIL tend to show weaker emission and, in some cases, a lack of distinct absorption lines. These trends seemingly break down by enhanced CSM interaction that affects the P-Cygni profiles. Our data-driven method reveals underlying spectral correlations and supports a continuous distribution between IIP and IIL subtypes. This method paves the way for more refined classification algorithms.</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>Aligned and misaligned metallicity gradients in young stars and star-forming regions in the EAGLE discs</strong>, Isha Shailesh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15604v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15604v1</a></p>

<p>Disc galaxies exhibit radial metallicity gradients in both their stellar and gaseous components. The star-forming gas (SFG) in HII regions and young stars (YSs) trace the recent evolutionary history of the galaxy. We aim to assess the extent to which the joint analysis of metallicity gradient alignment in YSs and SFG can constrain the recent evolutionary history of galaxies. Using the high-resolution run of the EAGLE project, we derived radial, azimuthally averaged oxygen abundance profiles for YSs (age &lt; 2 Gyr) and SFG and measured their gradients as the slopes of linear fits to these profiles. We classified galaxies into four groups based on the signs (N for negative and P for positive) of the slopes: NN, NP, PP, and PN (the first letter is for YSs and the second for SFG). We found that galaxies with NN, NP, PP, and PN combinations of metallicity profiles reflect different evolutionary paths over the past ~ 2 Gyr. NN galaxies exhibit sustained inside-out growth accompanied by high star formation efficiency, whereas NP and PP systems show evidence of recent or ongoing feedback-driven disruption, with PP galaxies likely being predominantly shaped by supernova feedback. PN galaxies, by contrast, show evidence of past violent events followed by gradient recovery, highlighting the interplay between inflows, feedback, and gas cooling in shaping metallicity distributions. The degree of alignment between the stellar and gas metallicity gradients provides a way to time the occurrence of significant events in the evolutionary history of galaxies, which contribute through a combination of gas inflows, star formation triggering, and metal mixing. They could also serve as probes of sub-grid physics when observations provide suitable comparison datasets. [Abridged]</p>

<p>An Amplitude-Encoded Quantum Genetic Algorithm (AEQGA) has been developed to minimize $χ^2$ functions of different cosmological probes (Supernovae Type Ia, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation), to find the best-fit value for two cosmological parameters, namely the Hubble Constant and the density matter content of the Universe today. Our main aim is to pave the way to testing the adoption of quantum optimization in the inference of the cosmological parameters that describe the universe evolution. AEQGA computes the merit function classically, and then uses a quantum circuit to entangle the population and perform crossover and mutation operations. The results show consistency with the isocontours of the objective functions. We then tested the general behavior of AEQGA as a function of its hyperparameters and compared it with a second quantum genetic algorithm found in the literature as well as with classical algorithms, finding consistent results.</p>

<p>Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) remain an intriguing topic in supernova (SN) transient astronomy. While the majority of SLSNe are shown to be explained by energy streaming from the newly born magnetar, there are others which are powered by different mechanisms. We analyse the pseudo-bolometric light curve of the nearby helium-rich SLSN 2021bnw. We built models and run hydrodynamics radiative-transfer simulations with STELLA. Our best-fit models include 15-22.5 Msun of ejecta enriched with 1.7 Msun of 56 Ni and carrying energy of 4 foe, and colliding w ith 7 Msun of circumstellar matter which match the observed light curve very well. The early data can be explained as cooling of an expanding shell with the mass of 0.5 Msun and kinetic energy of 0.7 foe. We tend to exclude a pulsational pair-instability (PPISN) origin for SLSN 2021bnw. Instead we conclude that SLSN 2021bnw was preferably a core-collapse explosion of a star with the initial mass of not less than 61 Msun aided by magnetorotational effects.</p>

<p>2026-02-16, <strong>Three-Dimensional Kinematics of the Oxygen-rich Supernova Remnant G292.0+1.8</strong>, Adele L. Plunkett et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15165v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15165v1</a></p>

<p>Studying the remnants of young core-collapse supernovae (SNe) can yield insight into the chemical composition of their progenitors and the geometry of the explosions. The supernova remnant (SNR) G292.0+1.8 is one of only three known oxygen-rich SNRs in the galaxy-remnants of core-collapse for which relatively pure fragments of ejecta can be seen. Several dozen ejecta knots from G292.0+1.8 were the subject of a proper motion analysis, based on [O III] 5007-Angstrom images taken over a 22-year baseline by Winkler et al. 2009 (arXiv:0810.1935). They determined that the transverse velocities of the filaments are linearly proportional to their distances from a common expansion center, thus the O-rich filaments have been traveling with little deceleration since the initial supernova event,about 3000 years ago. In this paper, we use optical spectra of G292.0+1.8, all taken from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), to measure radial velocities for 93 knots. Assuming un-decelerated expansion, as indi- cated by the proper motions, the radial velocity should be proportional to the distance from the center along the line of sight, just as the proper motions are proportional to the transverse distance. Therefore, we can map the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of the SNR. We find that the knots generally follow a broad bi-conical distribution, suggesting that the supernova explosion produced broad jets of ejecta. This structure is similar to that seen in some other young core-collapse supernova remnants.</p>

<p>2026-02-16, <strong>Exploring the magnetic field of the ultraluminous X-ray pulsar NGC 4631 X-8</strong>, Amar Deo Chandra et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14876v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.14876v1</a></p>

<p>NGC 4631 X-8 is an ultraluminous X-ray pulsar (ULXP) having a spin period of about 9.7 s, discovered using XMM-Newton observations in 2025. The pulsar is known to show one of the largest spin-up rates ($\sim 9.6 \times 10^{-8}$ s s$^{-1}$) among the ULXP population. We explore the surface magnetic field of the neutron star in this source using different models, and find that the inferred magnetic field lies in the range of about $0.3-2 \times 10^{14}$G. We study the long-term magnetic field and spin period evolution of the pulsar assuming steady accretion using prevalent theoretical mechanisms and find that the pulsar will evolve to become a millisecond pulsar having decayed magnetic field of about $\sim 10^{9}$G in about a million years. The scenario of the formation of a millisecond pulsar is also probed using an estimate of the super-Eddington duty cycle of about 14% from the literature, which suggests that the neutron star would accrete sufficient matter to become a recycled millisecond pulsar. Exploring the magnetic field as well as the spin period evolution properties of ULXPs may enable us to understand the poorly understood evolutionary features of ULXPs, shed light on one of the pathways of millisecond pulsar formation and also help us to understand transient super-Eddington accretion phases in newborn magnetars, which are believed to power energetic events such as long gamma-ray bursts and Type I superluminous supernovae.</p>

<p>2026-02-16, <strong>Evidence for the merger hypothesis in V4332 Sgr: a low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio and multiple outbursts</strong>, D. P. K. Banerjee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14781v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.14781v1</a></p>

<p>Following the detections of the first extragalactic ``Luminous Red Nova’’ (LRN) M31 RV in 1989, and its first Galactic counterpart V4332~Sgr in 1994, there have been many discoveries of similar, or closely related, objects. They are important because they bridge the luminosity gap between the brightest novae and supernovae, a largely unexplored parameter space. The cause of eruptions in LRNe is still unclear, a stellar merger being the most favored mechanism. However, barring V1309~Sco, there has been no direct evidence for a merger in the other objects. Here we present strong evidence that V4332~Sgr was a merger event. High resolution infrared observations of the CO fundamental band show an unusually small $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of $3.5\pm1$. This indicates that a violent event had occurred, whose effects penetrated deep enough to allow CNO cycle processed $^{13}$C in the inner H burning shell to be brought to the surface. We rule out planetary ingestion, and propose that the eruption was due to a merger between V4332~Sgr and a companion star. It is shown that V4332~Sgr was likely surrounded by an edge-on disk before its eruption. If this disk was a flattened common envelope containing V4332~Sgr and a companion star, then a merger scenario would not be inconsistent. Furthermore, V4332~Sgr had multiple outbursts, previously unreported but an important piece of information, since multiple outbursts are a trait shared by many LRNe.</p>

<p>2026-02-16, <strong>H.E.S.S. detection of the PSR J0855-4644 nebula</strong>, F. Aharonian et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14640v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.14640v1</a></p>

<p>HESS J0852-463 is a TeV γ-ray source located in the Galactic plane. The region consists of a supernova remnant (SNR, RX J0852.0-4622) with a shell-like morphology, commonly referred to as Vela Junior, and a pulsar denoted PSR J0855-4644. Pulsars are among the most efficient leptonic accelerators in our Galaxy, making this region particularly interesting to study. We utilise the most recent data taken by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), to investigate any γ-ray emission associated with the pulsar in this region, PSR J0855-4644. We applied a full forward folding method on the H.E.S.S. data. Utilising 3D modelling techniques, we evaluated the TeV γ-ray emission towards the various components of this complex system. The distinct energy-dependent morphology observed in our data motivates further investigation of this source. We resolved the emission in the Vela Junior region into various components, several of which correspond to the SNR itself. In particular, we find a new extended component which is coincident with the position of PSR J0855-4644. The spectrum follows a power-law distribution with a best-fit index of ΓE = 1.81 \pm 0.07stat which differs from the properties of the surrounding γ-ray emission of the Vela Junior SNR. A one-zone leptonic joint fit between the X-rays (from XMM-Newton) and γ-rays (from H.E.S.S.) leads to a lower limit on the magnetic field of 1.6μG and a spectral index of α = 1.88 \pm 0.01, in line with expectations of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). In this paper, we report the first detection of the PWN of PSR J0855-4644 at TeV energies with the H.E.S.S. experiment at a significance of 12.2σ. This is attributed to the advanced techniques of the 3D analysis. Based on the pulsar’s characteristics, its PWN is consistent with the known TeV PWNe population in the Galaxy.</p>

<p>2026-02-16, <strong>The Physical Properties of PS1-12sk and the Implications to Its Progenitor System</strong>, Kai-Li Mi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14427v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.14427v1</a></p>

<p>PS1-12sk is a type Ibn supernova (SN) found at the host environment showing no obvious ongoing star formation, which challenges the massive star explosion scenario. We use the ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction (CSI) and the CSI plus $^{56}$Ni models in the context of double white dwarf (WD) merger to fit the bolometric light curve (LC) of PS1-12sk, since the He emission lines at the photospheric phases indicated the interaction between the SN ejecta and He-rich CSM. We find that the CSI model failed to explain the LC, but the CSI plus $^{56}$Ni model can account for the bolometric LC. The derived masses of the two WDs and $^{56}$Ni are $\sim 0.70 M_\odot$, $\sim 0.40 M_\odot$, and $\sim 0.09\,M_\odot$, respectively. The facts that the ejecta mass ($\sim 0.984 M_\odot$) is well below the Chandrasekhar limit ($\sim 1.4 M_\odot$) and that the $^{56}$Ni mass is comparable to the $^{56}$Ni yields of the explosions of some sub-Chandrasekhar explosion models support the scenario that PS1-12sk might be from a sub-Chandrasekhar explosion induced by the merger of two low-mass WDs. The derived innermost radius ($\sim 13.81 \times 10^{12}$ cm) and the mass of the CSM ($\sim 0.116 M_\odot$) disfavor the possibility that the CSM was formed in the merger phase. We suggest that the flybys before the merger can account for the position and mass of the CSM.</p>
