<p>2024-02-08, <strong>Explaining the $B^+\to K^+ ν\barν$ excess via a massless dark photon</strong>, E. Gabrielli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05901v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.05901v1</a></p>

<p>The Belle II collaboration has recently observed the rare decay $B^+\to K^+ \nu \bar{\nu}$, finding an excess with respect to the Standard Model prediction. We explore the possibility that the data entails long-distance interactions induced by a massless dark photon, $\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{D}}$. This couples at the tree-level to an invisible, dark sector and to the Standard Model via higher-dimensional operators, such as the chromomagnetic-dipole coupling that we use to explain the excess. As the process $B^+\to K^+ \gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{D}}$ is forbidden by angular momentum conservation, the transition mediated by the off-shell dark photon yields a three-body final state comprising a pair of dark fermions that show as a missing energy continuum in the detector, faking the neutrino signature. We show that the Belle II data is explained for perturbative values of the parameters of the model. This scenario predicts new contributions to the neutral $B$ meson decays $B^0\to K^* \gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{D}}$, in which the emission of a on-shell dark photon is allowed, yielding a monochromatic missing energy signature. Analogously, an excess due to the emission of a dark photon is predicted for the $B^0_s\to \phi + E_{\rm miss}$ decay that could be scrutinized next at the LHCb experiments.</p>

<p>2024-02-08, <strong>Fundamental physics with ESPRESSO: a new determination of the D/H ratio towards PKS1937-101</strong>, Francesco Guarneri et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05586v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.05586v1</a></p>

<p>Primordial abundances of light elements are sensitive to the physics of the early Universe and can directly constrain cosmological quantities, such as the baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta_{10}$, the baryon density and the number of neutrino families. Deuterium is especially suited for these studies: its primordial abundance is sensitive and monotonically dependent on $\eta_{10}$, allowing an independent measurement of the cosmic baryon density that can be compared, for instance, against the Planck satellite data. The primordial deuterium abundance can be measured in high $H_I$ column density absorption systems towards distant quasars. We report here a new measurement, based on high-resolution ESPRESSO data, of the primordial $D_I$ abundance of a system at redshift $z \sim 3.572$, towards PKS1937-101. Using only ESPRESSO data, we find a D/H ratio of $2.638\pm0.128 \times 10^{-5}$, while including the available UVES data improves the precision, leading to a ratio of $2.608 \pm 0.102 \times 10^{-5}$. The results of this analysis agree with those of the most precise existing measurements. We find that the relatively low column density of this system ($\log{N_{\rm H_I}/ {\rm cm}^{-2}}\sim18 $) introduces modelling uncertainties, which become the main contributor to the error budget.</p>

<p>2024-02-08, <strong>Light vector mediators at direct detection experiments</strong>, Valentina De Romeri et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05506v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.05506v1</a></p>

<p>Solar neutrinos induce elastic neutrino-electron scattering in dark matter direct detection experiments, resulting in detectable event rates at current facilities. We analyze recent data from the XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN, and PandaX-4T experiments and we derive stringent constraints on several $U(1)’$ extensions of the Standard Model, accommodating new neutrino-electron interactions. We provide bounds on the relevant coupling and mass of light vector mediators for a variety of models, including the anomaly-free $B-L$ model, lepton flavor-dependent interactions like $L_\alpha - L_{\beta}$, $B-2L_e - L_{\mu, \tau}$, $B-3L_\alpha$, and $B+2L_\mu +2 L_{\tau}$ models. We compare our results with other limits obtained in the literature from both terrestrial and astrophysical experiments. Finally, we present forecasts for improving current bounds with a future experiment like DARWIN.</p>

<p>2024-02-08, <strong>Performance of the Mass Testing Setup for Arrays of Silicon Photomultipliers in the TAO Experiment</strong>, A. Rybnikov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05487v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.05487v1</a></p>

<p>Modern neutrino physics detectors often employ thousands, and sometimes even hundreds of thousands, of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). The TAO experiment is a notable example that utilizes a spherical scintillator barrel with a diameter of 1.8 meters, housing approximately 130,000 SiPMs organized into 4,100 tiles. Each tile with size of 5x5cm^2 consists of a 32-SiPM array functioning as a single detector unit. To achieve an unparalleled energy resolution of 2% at 1 MeV within this volume, the SiPMs must possess cutting-edge parameters, including a photon detection efficiency (PDE) exceeding 50%, cross-talk of approximately 10%, and an extremely low dark count rate (DCR) below 50Hz/mm^2. Maintaining the setup at a negative temperature of -50C is necessary to achieve the desired DCR. This article presents the setup and methods employed to individually characterize the mass of SiPMs across all 4,100 tiles at the specified negative temperature.</p>

<p>2024-02-08, <strong>Probing the small scale structure of the Inter-Galactic Medium with ESPRESSO: spectroscopy of the lensed QSO UM673</strong>, Stefano Cristiani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05896v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.05896v1</a></p>

<p>The gravitationally lensed quasar J014516.6-094517 at z=2.719 has been observed with the ESPRESSO instrument at the ESO VLT to obtain high-fidelity spectra of the two images A and B with a resolving power R=70000. At the redshifts under investigation (2.1 &lt; z &lt; 2.7), the Lyman forests along the two sightlines are separated by sub-kiloparsec physical distances and exhibit a strong correlation. We find that the two forests are indistinguishable at the present level of signal-to-noise ratio and do not show any global velocity shift, with the cross-correlation peaking at $\Delta v = 12 \pm 48$ m/s. The distribution of the difference in velocity of individual Lyman-$\alpha$ features is compatible with a null average and a mean absolute deviation of 930 m/s. Significant differences in NHI column density are not detected, putting a limit to the RMS fluctuation in the baryon density on $\leq 1$ proper kpc scales of $\Delta \rho / \rho &lt; 3$%. On the other hand, metal lines show significant differences both in velocity structure and in column density. A toy model shows that the difference in velocity of the metal features between the two sightlines is compatible with the the motions of the baryonic component associated to dark matter halos of typical mass $M\simeq 2\times 10^{10} M_\odot$, also compatible with the observed incidence of the metal systems. The present observations confirm the feasibility of the Sandage test of the cosmic redshift drift with high-fidelity spectroscopy of the Lyman forest of distant, bright quasars, but also provide an element of caution about the intrinsic noise associated to the usage of metal features for the same purpose.</p>

<p>2024-02-08, <strong>Cosmological Forecast of the Void Size Function Measurement from the CSST Spectroscopic Survey</strong>, Yingxiao Song et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05492v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.05492v1</a></p>

<p>Void size function (VSF) contains the information of the cosmic large-scale structure (LSS), and can be used to derive the properties of dark energy and dark matter. We predict the VSFs measured from the spectroscopic galaxy survey operated by the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), and study the strength of cosmological constraint. We employ a high-resolution Jiutian simulation to get galaxy samples based on an improved semi-analytical model, and then generate a mock galaxy catalog of the CSST spectroscopic survey according to the detection sensitivity. We identify voids from this galaxy catalog using the watershed algorithm without assuming a spherical shape, and estimate the VSFs at different redshift bins from $z=0.5$ to 1.1. To obtain a reliable and accurate fitting result, we propose a void selection method based on the ellipticity, for comparing to the theoretical model with a linear underdensity threshold of void formation $\delta_{\rm v}$ assuming the spherical evolution. We assume $\delta_{\rm v}$ is redshift-dependent and set it as a free parameter in each redshift bin. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is adopted to implement the constraints on the cosmological and void parameters. We find that the VSFs from the selected voids can be well fitted by the theoretical model, and could accurately reserve the cosmological information. Based on our estimation, the VSF measurement of the CSST spectroscopic survey can constrain the cosmological parameters to a few percent level. The best-fit values of $\delta_{\rm v}$ are ranging from $\sim-0.4$ to $-0.1$ as the redshift increases from 0.5 to 1.1, which has a distinct difference from the theoretical calculation with a constant $\delta_{\rm v}\simeq-2.7$ assuming the spherical evolution. Our method can provide a good reference for void identification and selection in the VSF analysis of the spectroscopic galaxy surveys.</p>

<p>2024-02-08, <strong>Robust inference of the Galactic centre gamma-ray excess spatial properties</strong>, Deheng Song et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05449v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.05449v1</a></p>

<p>The gamma-ray Fermi-LAT Galactic centre excess (GCE) has puzzled scientists for over 15 years. Despite ongoing debates about its properties, and especially its spatial distribution, its nature remains elusive. We scrutinize how the estimated spatial morphology of this excess depends on models for the Galactic diffuse emission, focusing particularly on the extent to which the Galactic plane and point sources are masked. Our main aim is to compare a spherically symmetric morphology - potentially arising from the annihilation of dark matter (DM) particles - with a boxy morphology - expected if faint unresolved sources in the Galactic bulge dominate the excess emission. Recent claims favouring a DM-motivated template for the GCE are shown to rely on a specific Galactic bulge template, which performs worse than other templates for the Galactic bulge. We find that a non-parametric model of the Galactic bulge derived from the VVV survey results in a significantly better fit for the GCE than DM-motivated templates. This result is independent of whether a GALPROP-based model or a more non-parametric ring-based model is used to describe the diffuse Galactic emission. This conclusion remains true even when additional freedom is added in the background models, allowing for non-parametric modulation of the model components and substantially improving the fit quality. When adopted, optimized background models provide robust results in terms of preference for a boxy bulge morphology of the GCE, regardless of the mask applied to the Galactic plane.</p>

<p>2024-02-08, <strong>Significant noise improvement in a Kinetic Inductance Phonon-Mediated detector by use of a wideband parametric amplifier</strong>, Karthik Ramanathan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05419v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.05419v1</a></p>

<p>Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) have been demonstrated as capable phonon sensors when coupled to crystalline substrates, and have been proposed as detectors for next-generation rare-event searches such as for the direct detection of dark matter. These Kinetic Inductance Phonon Mediated (KIPM) detector designs, favoring large superconducting absorber volumes and high readout powers, are oftentimes limited in their sensitivity by low temperature amplifier noise introduced in the signal readout chain. We report here an effort to couple a wideband Kinetic Inductance Travelling Wave Parametric Amplifier (KI-TWPA), operated near the Standard Quantum Limit of minimal added amplifier noise, to sensors spanning a 70 MHz bandwidth at 3.5 GHz. This results in a ~5x improvement in the inferred detector energy resolution in the best sensor and highlights the potential of constructing O(100) meV resolving phonon-mediated particle detectors. We detail limitations introduced by lossy passive components, degraded RF responsivity, and microphysical noise sources like two-level systems (TLS), in achieving ultimate quantum-limited system noise levels.</p>

<p>2024-02-08, <strong>The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey. XXXVII. Distant RR Lyrae Stars and the Milky Way Stellar Halo out to 300 kpc</strong>, Yuting Feng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05418v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.05418v1</a></p>

<p>RR Lyrae stars are standard candles with characteristic photometric variability and serve as powerful tracers of Galactic structure, substructure, accretion history, and dark matter content. Here we report the discovery of distant RR Lyrae stars, including some of the most distant stars known in the Milky Way halo, with Galactocentric distances of approximately 300 kpc. We use time-series u*g’i’z’ Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope/MegaCam photometry from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). We employ a template light curve fitting method based on empirical Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 RR Lyrae data to identify RR Lyrae candidates in the NGVS data set. We eliminate several hundred suspected quasars and identify 180 RR Lyrae candidates, with heliocentric distances of approximately 20–300 kpc. The halo stellar density distribution is consistent with an r^(-4.09 +/- 0.10) power-law radial profile over most of this distance range with no signs of a break. The distribution of ab-type RR Lyrae in a period-amplitude plot (Bailey diagram) suggests that the mean metallicity of the halo decreases outwards. Compared to other recent RR Lyrae surveys, like Pan-STARRS1 (PS1), the High Cadence Transient Survey (HiTS), and the Dark Energy Survey (DES), our NGVS study has better single-epoch photometric precision and a comparable number of epochs but smaller sky coverage. At large distances, our RR Lyrae sample appears to be relatively pure and complete, with well-measured periods and amplitudes. These newly discovered distant RR Lyrae stars are important additions to the few secure stellar tracers beyond 150 kpc in the Milky Way halo.</p>

<p>2024-02-08, <strong>The AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project. V: Satellite Galaxy Populations In A Cosmological Zoom-in Simulation of A Milky Way-mass Halo</strong>, Minyong Jung et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05392v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.05392v1</a></p>

<p>We analyze and compare the satellite halo populations at $z\sim2$ in the high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a $10^{12}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ target halo ($z=0$ mass) carried out on eight widely-used astrophysical simulation codes ({\sc Art-I}, {\sc Enzo}, {\sc Ramses}, {\sc Changa}, {\sc Gadget-3}, {\sc Gear}, {\sc Arepo-t}, and {\sc Gizmo}) for the {\it AGORA} High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project. We use slightly different redshift epochs near $z=2$ for each code (hereafter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$z\sim2$') at which the eight simulations are in the same stage in the target halo's merger history. After identifying the matched pairs of halos between the {\it CosmoRun} simulations and the DMO simulations, we discover that each {\it CosmoRun} halo tends to be less massive than its DMO counterpart. When we consider only the halos containing stellar particles at $z\sim2$, the number of satellite {\it galaxies} is significantly fewer than that of dark matter halos in all participating {\it AGORA} simulations, and is comparable to the number of present-day satellites near the Milky Way or M31. The so-called</code>missing satellite problem’ is fully resolved across all participating codes simply by implementing the common baryonic physics adopted in {\it AGORA} and the stellar feedback prescription commonly used in each code, with sufficient numerical resolution ($\lesssim100$ proper pc at $z=2$). We also compare other properties such as the stellar mass$-$halo mass relation and the mass$-$metallicity relation. Our work highlights the value of comparison studies such as {\it AGORA}, where outstanding problems in galaxy formation theory are studied simultaneously on multiple numerical platforms.</p>

<p>2024-02-08, <strong>Dark matter effects of a black hole with nonsingular Yukawa-modified potential in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</strong>, Yassine Sekhmani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05344v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.05344v1</a></p>

<p>This paper investigates the contribution of the nonsingular Yukawa-modified potential in the context of four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity modeling by a static and spherically symmetric black hole solution. These Yukawa-type corrections are essentially described along two parameters, $\beta$ and $\lambda$, affecting Newton’s law of gravity at large distances, and a deformation parameter $\ell_0$, which is essential at short distances. Primarily, the strongest effect is encoded in $\beta$, which alters the total mass of the black hole with additional mass proportional to $\beta\mathcal{M}$, imitating the effects of dark matter at large distances from the black hole. In contrast, the effect due to $\lambda$ is small for astrophysical values. On the other hand, the EGB gravity is ruled by the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling constant $\alpha$, a fundamental parameter of the theory. We pay particular attention to thermodynamic stability, critical orbits, geodesics and quasinormal modes. The results demonstrate stability of the black hole solution for a range of values of the GB coupling constant $\alpha$. Furthermore, this study investigates the null geodesic motion, namely the shadow behavior, providing intriguing results in relation to the size of the black hole shadow.</p>

<p>2024-02-08, <strong>Cosmic-ray induced ionization rates and non-thermal emissions from nuclei of starburst galaxies</strong>, Vo Hong Minh Phan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05915v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.05915v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmic rays are the only agent capable of ionizing the interior of dense molecular clouds and, thus, they are believed to play an essential role in determining the physical and chemical evolution of star-forming regions. In this work, we aim to study cosmic-ray induced ionization rates in starburst environments using non-thermal emissions of cosmic rays from starburst nuclei. To this end, we first revisit cosmic-ray models which could explain data of non-thermal emissions from radio to X-ray and gamma-ray from nuclei of three prototypical starburst galaxies NGC 253, M82, and Arp 220. These models are then applied to predict ionization rates in starburst environments which gives values around $10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$. Such a high value of the ionization rate, which is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than the typical values found in the Milky Way, is probably due to relatively high rates of supernova explosions occurring within the nuclei of these starburst galaxies. We also discuss in more details the case of NGC 253 where our predicted ionization rate is found to be, in most cases, a few times smaller than the values inferred from molecular line observations of clouds in the starburst nucleus. The general framework provided in this work illustrates how the use of non-thermal emission data could help to provide more insights into ionization rates or, more generally, cosmic-ray impact in starburst environments.</p>

<p>The deposition of energy and momentum by supernova explosions has been subject to numerous studies in the past few decades. However, while there has been some work that focused on the transition from the adiabatic to the radiative stage of a supernova remnant (SNR), the late radiative stage and merging with the interstellar medium (ISM) have received little attention. Here, we use three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations, focusing on the evolution of SNRs during the radiative phase, considering a wide range of physical explosion parameters ($n_{\text{H, ISM}} \in \left[0.1, 100\right] \text{cm}^{-3}$ and $E_{\text{SN}} \in \left[1, 14\right]\times 10^{51} \text{erg}$). We find that the radiative phase can be subdivided in four stages: A pressure driven snowplow phase during which the hot overpressurized bubble gas is evacuated and pushed into the cold shell, a momentum conserving snowplow phase which is accompanied by a broadening of the shell, an implosion phase where cold material from the back of the shell is flooding the central vacuum and a final cloud phase, during which the imploding gas is settling as a central, compact overdensity. The launching timescale for the implosion ranges from a few 100 kyr to a few Myr, while the cloud formation timescale ranges from a few to about 10 Myr. The highly chemically enriched clouds can become massive ($M_{\text{cl}} \sim 10^3 - 10^4 \, \text{M}_{\odot}$) and self-gravitating within a few Myr after their formation, providing an attractive, novel pathway for supernova induced star and planet formation in the ISM.</p>
