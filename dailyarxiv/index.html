<p>2025-05-28, <strong>First measurement of neutron capture multiplicity in neutrino-oxygen neutral-current quasi-elastic-like interactions using an accelerator neutrino beam</strong>, T2K Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22547v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.22547v1</a></p>

<p>We report the first measurement of neutron capture multiplicity in neutrino-oxygen neutral-current quasi-elastic-like interactions at the gadolinium-loaded Super-Kamiokande detector using the T2K neutrino beam, which has a peak energy of about 0.6 GeV. A total of 30 neutral-current quasi-elastic-like event candidates were selected from T2K data corresponding to an exposure of $1.76\times10^{20}$ protons on target. The $\gamma$ ray signals resulting from neutron captures were identified using a neural network. The flux-averaged mean neutron capture multiplicity was measured to be $1.37\pm0.33\text{ (stat.)}$$(^{+0.17}_{-0.27})$, which is compatible within $2.3\,\sigma$ than predictions obtained using our nominal simulation. We discuss potential sources of systematic uncertainty in the prediction and demonstrate that a significant portion of this discrepancy arises from the modeling of hadron-nucleus interactions in the detector medium.</p>

<p>2025-05-28, <strong>Opening up New Parameter Space for Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter</strong>, P. S. Bhupal Dev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22463v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.22463v1</a></p>

<p>Sterile neutrinos are compelling dark matter (DM) candidates, yet the minimal production mechanism solely based on active ($\nu_a$)-sterile ($\nu_s$) oscillations is excluded by astrophysical observations. Non-standard self-interactions in either active ($\nu_a-\nu_a$) or sterile ($\nu_s-\nu_s$) sector are known to alter the sterile neutrino DM production in the early Universe, which could alleviate the tension with astrophysical constraints to some extent. Here we propose a novel solution where scalar-mediated non-standard interactions between active and sterile neutrinos ($\nu_a-\nu_s$) generate new production channels for $\nu_s$, independent of the active-sterile mixing and without the need for any fine-tuned resonance or primordial lepton asymmetry. This framework enables efficient sterile neutrino DM production even at vanishingly small mixing angles and opens up new viable regions of parameter space that can be tested with future $X$-ray and gamma-ray observations.</p>

<p>2025-05-28, <strong>IceCube PeV neutrinos from heavy dark matter decay with 12 years HESE data</strong>, Diptarko Mukherjee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22204v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.22204v1</a></p>

<p>The decay of superheavy dark matter from the early universe may undergo decay via QCD cascades and electroweak cascade to produce neutrinos as one of the decay products. We consider the neutrino events in and around PeV region reported by IceCube collaboration are due to the decay of such heavy dark matter. The neutrino spectrum could be from the decay processes via hadronic decay modes and/or leptonic decay modes. Using the numerical evolution of QCD cascades as well as electroweak corrections where use has been made of DGLAP equations, the neutrino fluxes from the heavy dark matter decay have been computed. The mass of the decaying superheavy dark matter and its decay lifetime have then been estimated from a $\chi^2$ analysis of the IceCube 12-year data. The fractional contribution ($f_{\rm lep}$) of the leptonic decay channel in such a decay process is also estimated from the same $\chi^2$ analyses. It is seen that to explain the IceCube 12-year ultrahigh energy (UHE) events the mass of a decaying superheavy dark matter would be $\sim9.4\times 10^6$ GeV and decay time $\tau \simeq 4.2 \times 10^{28}$ second. It is also found that the lepton channel contribution is very small, $f_{\rm lep} \sim 0.001$.</p>

<p>2025-05-28, <strong>Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays</strong>, NoÃ©mie Globus et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21846v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.21846v1</a></p>

<p>Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays, UHECR, are charged particles with energies between $\sim10^{18}\,{\rm eV}$ and $\sim3\times10^{20}\,{\rm eV}\sim50\,{\rm J}$. They exhibit fundamental physics at energies inaccessible to terrestrial accelerators, challenge experimental physics and connect strongly to astronomical observations through electromagnetic, neutrino and even gravitational wave channels. There has been much theoretical and observational progress in the sixty years that have elapsed since the discovery of UHECR, to divine their nature and identify their sources. The highest energy UHECR appear to be heavy nuclei with rigidity extending up to $\sim10\,{\rm EV}$; A significant ($6.9\sigma$) dipole anisotropy has been measured but our poor understanding of the Galactic magnetic fields makes this hard to interpret; The UHECR luminosity density is $\sim 10^{44}$ erg Mpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ which constrains explanations of their origin; The most promising acceleration mechanisms involve diffusive shock acceleration and unipolar induction; The most promising sources include intergalactic accretion shocks, and relativistic jets from stellar-mass or supermassive black holes. We explore the prospects for using the highest energy events, combined with multimessenger astronomy, to help us solve the riddle of UHECR.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>Fragmentation in Collapsar Disks: Migration, Growth, and Emission</strong>, Y. Lerner et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21617v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.21617v1</a></p>

<p>We present a parameter survey of fragmentation in collapsar disks, using a revised version of the Chen &amp; Beloborodov (2007) model that determines the structure of steady state hyperaccretion disks in a general relativistic and neutrino cooled framework. We map out the range of disk conditions leading to gravitational instability alongside an exploration of the dimensionless cooling time $\beta$, which together determine whether fragmentation is likely to occur. We estimate the initial mass and density of fragments, finding that they occupy a unique region in the space of self-gravitating compact objects, with masses $M_{\rm f} \sim 10^{-3} M_\odot -10^{-1} M_\odot$ and densities $\rho_{\rm f}\sim 10^8-10^{11}~{\rm g~cm}^{-3}$. We then calculate their migration and mass growth (via Bondi-Hoyle accretion) as they inspiral through the collapsar disk. During a fragmentâs migration to the central black hole, it can grow its mass up to a range $M_{\rm f}\sim 10^{-1} M_\odot - 1 M_\odot$. In most cases, the final fragment mass is larger than the minimum cold stable neutron star mass but much smaller than any observed neutron star. The fragment briefly achieves peak accretion rates comparable to (or even larger than) that of the central engine. We propose that these bound fragments may give rise to observable astrophysical phenomena, and we approximately model two of these: (i) gamma ray burst variability produced by a secondary, fragment-launched jet; (ii) the generation of non-vacuum gravitational waveforms accompanied by electromagnetic counterparts.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>Modular-symmetry-protected seesaw</strong>, A. Granelli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21405v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.21405v1</a></p>

<p>In the presence of a finite modular flavour symmetry, fermion mass hierarchies may be generated by a slight deviation of the modulus from a symmetric point. We point out that this small parameter governing charged-lepton mass hierarchies may also be responsible for the breaking of lepton number in a symmetry-protected low-scale seesaw, sourcing active neutrino masses and the mass splitting of a pseudo-Dirac pair of heavy neutrinos. We look into the phenomenological implications of this mechanism.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>The UV Laser Calibration System for measuring the Electric field in the SBND</strong>, Shivaraj Mulleria Babu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21151v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.21151v1</a></p>

<p>The Short Baseline Near Detector (SBND) is a LArTPC detector, located 110 meters from the Fermilabâs Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB). It is designed to measure neutrino cross-section and aid in searches for excess electron like neutrino events. The electric field inside the SBND-TPC may have distortions due to a number of reasons, such as the space charge effect. The space charge effect comes from the abundance of cosmic rays that ionize the argon, producing copious positive argon ions. In this case, we need an alternative solution to determine the electric field distortion inside the TPC volume and compensate for the possible distortion in the spatial information. The UV Laser system is one such attempt to determine the electric field distortion. By utilising a high energy ultraviolet laser beam, the system can map the spatial distortions within the TPC volume and provide the necessary corrections to ensure accurate spatial and calorimetric measurements.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>On chirality and chiral neutrino oscillations</strong>, Evgeny Akhmedov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20982v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.20982v1</a></p>

<p>It has been claimed in a number of publications that neutrinos can exhibit chirality oscillations. In this note we discuss the notion of chirality and show that chiral neutrino oscillations in vacuum do not occur. We argue that the incorrect claims to the contrary resulted from a failure to clearly discriminate between quantum fields, states and wave functions. We also emphasize the role played in the erroneous claims on the possibility of chirality oscillations by the widely spread misconceptions about negative energies.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>Parametrizing the reconstruction performance of Super-Kamiokande in the Sub-GeV to TeV neutrino energy range</strong>, C. JesÃºs-Valls et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20812v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.20812v1</a></p>

<p>Super-Kamiokande is a paramount detector for studying atmospheric, astrophysical and accelerator neutrino physics. This work extracts and characterizes the neutrino reconstruction performance of Super-Kamiokande using the public data release from its latest atmospheric neutrino analysis. Energy and zenith angle reconstruction performances are derived and modeled for neutrinos spanning sub-GeV to TeV energies across different event samples and sample-specific and sample-aggregated performances are provided. These metrics enable realistic detector response modeling in phenomenological studies, establish benchmarks for evaluating alternative reconstruction algorithms, facilitate quantitative performance comparisons with other experiments, and provide a baseline performance model for the future Hyper-Kamiokande detector. This study represents the first publicly available comprehensive model to describe neutrino reconstruction in Super-Kamiokande in the Sub-GeV to TeV energies.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>The Extreme Universe Observatory on a Super-Pressure Balloon II: Mission, Payload, and Flight</strong>, James. H. Adams Jr. et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20762v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.20762v1</a></p>

<p>The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) is a pathfinder mission toward a space-based observatory such as the Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA). The aim of POEMMA is the observation of Ultra High Energy COsmic Rays (UHECRs) in order to elucidate their nature and origins and to discover $\gtrsim$ 20 PeV very high energy neutrinos that originate from transient and steady astrophysical sources. EUSO-SPB2 was launched from W=anaka New Zealand on May 13th, 2023 as a NASA Balloon Program Office test flight. The mission goals included making the first near-space altitude observations of the fluorescence emission from UHECR-induced extensive air showers (EASs) and making the first direct Cherenkov light emission from PeV cosmic rays traversing Earthâs atmosphere. In addition, a Target of Opportunity program was developed for selecting and scheduling observations of potential neutrino sources as they passed just below the Earthâs limb. Although a leaky balloon forced termination over the Pacific Ocean after 37 hours, data was collected to demonstrate the successful commissioning and operation of the instruments. This paper includes a description of the payload and the key instruments, pre-flight instrument characterizations in the lab and in the desert, flight operations and examples of the data collected. The flight was too short to catch a UHECR event via fluorescence, however about 10 candidate EAS events from cosmic rays were recorded via Cherenkov light.</p>

<p>2025-05-28, <strong>Attention-based Neural Network Emulators for Multi-Probe Data Vectors Part III: Modeling The Next Generation Surveys</strong>, Yijie Zhu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22574v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.22574v1</a></p>

<p>Machine learning can accelerate cosmological inferences that involve many sequential evaluations of computationally expensive data vectors. Previous works in this series have examined how machine learning architectures impact emulator accuracy and training time for optical shear and galaxy clustering 2-point function. In this final manuscript, we explore neural network performance when emulating Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization power spectra. We maximize the volume of applicability in the parameter space of our emulators within the standard $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter model while ensuring that errors are below cosmic variance. Relative to standard multi-layer perceptron architectures, we find the dot-product-attention mechanism reduces the number of outliers among testing cosmologies, defined as the fraction of testing points with $\Delta \chi^2 &gt; 0.2$ relative to \textsc{CAMB} outputs, for a wide range of training set sizes. Such precision enables attention-based emulators to be directly applied to real data without requiring any additional correction via importance sampling. Combined with pre-processing techniques and optimized activation and loss functions, attention-based models can meet the precision criteria set by current and future CMB and lensing experiments. For each of Planck, Simons Observatory, CMB S4, and CMB HD, we find the fraction of outlier points to be less than $10\%$ with around $2\times10^5$ to $4\times10^5$ training data vectors. We further explore the applications of these methods to supernova distance, weak lensing, and galaxy clustering, as well as alternative architectures and pre-processing techniques.</p>

<p>2025-05-28, <strong>Bayesian reconstruction of primordial perturbations from induced gravitational waves</strong>, Aya Ghaleb et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22534v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.22534v1</a></p>

<p>The formation of primordial black holes or other dark matter relics from amplified density fluctuations in the early universe may also generate scalar-induced gravitational waves (GW), carrying vital information about the primordial power spectrum and the early expansion history of our universe. We present a Bayesian approach aimed at reconstructing both the shape of the scalar power spectrum and the universeâs equation of state from GW observations, using interpolating splines to flexibly capture features in the GW data. The optimal number of spline nodes is chosen via Bayesian evidence, aiming at balancing complexity of the model and the fidelity of the reconstruction. We test our method using both representative mock data and recent Pulsar Timing Array measurements, demonstrating that it can accurately reconstruct the curvature power spectrum as well as the underlying equation of state, if different from radiation.</p>

<p>2025-05-28, <strong>Gravitational wave signatures of primordial black hole accretion during early matter domination</strong>, Rouzbeh Allahverdi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21885v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.21885v1</a></p>

<p>We present a scenario in which primordial black holes (PBHs) form in a post-inflationary radiation-dominated (RD) phase and then experience significant accretion during a phase of early matter dominated (EMD). We show that PBH masses could grow by up to two orders of magnitude. Restricting to the linear perturbation regime, we compute the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum that features two peaks. The high-frequency peak is associated with the PBH formation in the RD phase, while the low-frequency peak is due to the sudden transition from EMD to the later, standard RD phase. We identify a PBH mass range where one or both peaks can be observed by a combination of different GW detectors. Finally, we show the signal-to-noise ratio of the total GW spectrum for PBHs in the asteroid mass window, where they could comprise the totality of dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>Modified Newtonian Dynamics: Observational Successes and Failures</strong>, Harry Desmond et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21638v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.21638v1</a></p>

<p>Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is an alternative to the dark matter hypothesis that attempts to explain the âmissing gravityâ problem in astrophysics and cosmology through a modification to objectsâ dynamics. Since its conception in 1983, MOND has had a chequered history. Some phenomena difficult to understand in standard cosmology MOND explains remarkably well, most notably galaxiesâ radial dynamics encapsulated in the Radial Acceleration Relation. But for others it falls flat â mass discrepancies in clusters are not fully accounted for, the Solar System imposes a constraint on the shape of the MOND modification seemingly incompatible with that from galaxies, and non-radial motions are poorly predicted. An experiment that promised to be decisive â the wide binary test â has produced mainly confusion. This article summarises the good, the bad and the ugly of MONDâs observational existence. I argue that despite its imperfections it does possess ongoing relevance: there may yet be crucial insight to be gleaned from it.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>High-Frequency Gravitational Waves on BREAD</strong>, Rodolfo Capdevilla et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21628v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.21628v1</a></p>

<p>The use of light axion dark matter experiments as high-frequency gravitational wave (HFGW) detectors has garnered increasing attention in recent years. We explore the capabilities of the Broadband Reflector Experiment for Axion Detection (BREAD) in probing the GW parameter space and study the directional dependence of its coverage. This detector can investigate frequencies ranging from 0.05 to 200 THz. We find that employing single photon detectors BREAD is sensitive to GWs with characteristic strains as low as $10^{-21}$ at 0.1 THz and $10^{-25}$ at 200 THz with a year exposure time, making it competitive with other proposals operating at similar frequencies.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>Gravitational waves of quasi-circular, inspiraling black hole binaries in an ultralight vector dark-matter environment</strong>, TomÃ¡s Ferreira Chase et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21383v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.21383v1</a></p>

<p>The gravitational waves emitted by massive black hole binaries can be affected by a variety of environmental effects, which, if detected, could inform astrophysics and cosmology. We here study how gravitational waves emitted by black holes in quasi-circular orbits are affected by the presence of an ultra-light, vector-field, dark-matter environment that is minimally coupled to the binary. This dark-matter environment induces oscillatory gravitational potentials that perturb the orbit of the binary, leaving an imprint in the binaryâs binding energy, and thus, on the gravitational waves emitted. We here compute the effect of this environment on the gravitational-wave phase using the stationary-phase approximation within the post-Newtonian formalism. We then perform a Fisher analysis to estimate the detectability of this environmental effect with a four-year LISA observation, focusing on vector fields with ultra-light masses in the $(10^{-19}, 10^{-16}) \; \rm{eV}$ range. We conclude that the observation of such gravitational waves with space-borne interferometers, like LISA, could yield a measurement or constraint on local, vector dark-matter environments, provided the dark-matter density is larger than roughly $10^{14} \rm{M}_\odot/{\rm{pc}}^3$.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>Concurrent Exploration of Axion-Like Particle Interactions with Gauge Bosons at the LHC</strong>, Shirin Chenarani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21305v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.21305v1</a></p>

<p>Axion-like particles (ALPs) are pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with spontaneously broken global symmetries incorporated in the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian in many models beyond the SM. The existence of a light ALP is plausible due to the long-standing problems that the SM has not been able to address, such as the dark matter (DM) problem and the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. There are many proposals in recent decades considering the ALP as a solution to some of these shortcomings. Motivated by such potential, we search for ALPs with a mass of 1 MeV at the LHC in a model-independent fashion. We explore two complementary production modes: ALP production in association with a pair of electroweak gauge bosons ($ZZ$ or $WW$) and ALP production in association with a single gauge boson ($W$ or $Z$) plus jets. For the $VV+a$ final state, signal and dominant SM backgrounds are generated, and a realistic detector response simulation is performed. A multivariate analysis is employed to discriminate the $VV+a$ signal from background processes, and the expected $95\%$ confidence level (CL) exclusion limits in two-dimensional parameter spaces involving the ALP couplings are subsequently derived. The $V$+jets channel is interpreted using LHC measurements in regimes where the ALP escapes detection, appearing as missing energy. The two analyses are complementary: both the $VV+a$ and the $V$+jets channels probe simultaneously the ALP couplings to gluons and to electroweak gauge bosons. While the $VV+a$ channel offers clean multi-lepton final states and direct reconstruction of the $ZZ$ or $WW$ system, the $V$+jets channel benefits from larger production cross sections, enabling stronger constraints in certain regions of the parameter space.</p>

<p>The axion thermalization rate is a crucial input to determine the hot dark matter bound of axions, resulting from the scattering processes in the thermal bath of early Universe. We demonstrate that the commonly employed axion thermalization rate by including the $a\pi \leftrightarrow \pi\pi$ channel alone is significantly underestimated for the temperature $T$ above 100~MeV. This is obtained through the systematical calculation of the axion-light flavor meson scattering amplitudes within the framework of the chiral unitarization approach, paying special attention to the $a K \leftrightarrow \pi K$ reaction. Hadron resonances appearing in $a K \leftrightarrow \pi K$ amplitudes significantly enlarge the cross sections, which turn out to be much bigger than that of $a\pi \leftrightarrow\pi\pi$. The axion thermalization rate is then substantially enhanced by the $a K \leftrightarrow \pi K$ channel for $T\gtrsim 100$~MeV. Especially at $T\simeq 130$~MeV, the contribution from the $a K \leftrightarrow\pi K$ reaction to the axion thermalization rate exceeds the $a\pi\leftrightarrow\pi\pi$ one. Obviously more stringent constraints on the axion parameters are obtained, when confronting the number of extra relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ from Planck$â$18.</p>

<p>The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. These calculations are usually evaluated at the order-of-magnitude level for stellar populations where the DM density is highest, such as galactic centers. However, if the signature implies the destruction of the host star, their population could have been diminished over a Hubble time in the most DM-dense regions, unless replenished by star formation. This circumstance exemplifies the need for galactic star formation history profiles when deriving DM-induced transient rates, in particular for predicting the host-offset distribution. Here, we combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and efficient framework that permits us to estimate the target population formation rate and mass function within galactocentric radial zones across galaxy stellar masses and cosmic time. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to the hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the ignition of normal type Ia supernovae when colliding with white dwarf stars.</p>

<p>We set up and perform collision rate simulations between dark matter in the form of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) and white dwarf stars. These encounters trigger prompt detonations and could be the key to solving the ignition mystery of type Ia supernovae. Our framework is flexible enough to cover the full range of progenitor white dwarf masses, host galaxy stellar masses, galactocentric radial offsets, and cosmic time. The rate distribution pattern is consistent with exhaustive literature observational determinations for a slightly extended log-normal PBH mass spectrum. Most strikingly, the so far unexplained brightness distribution comes out without finetuning. We find no severe contradictions, except that the inferred PBH mass scale is unpredicted from first principles.</p>

<p>Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables cosmological parameter estimation when closed-form likelihoods or models are unavailable. However, SBI relies on machine learning for neural compression and density estimation. This requires large training datasets which are prohibitively expensive for high-quality simulations. We overcome this limitation with multifidelity transfer learning, combining less expensive, lower-fidelity simulations with a limited number of high-fidelity simulations. We demonstrate our methodology on dark matter density maps from two separate simulation suites in the hydrodynamical CAMELS Multifield Dataset. Pre-training on dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations reduces the required number of high-fidelity hydrodynamical simulations by a factor between $8$ and $15$, depending on the model complexity, posterior dimensionality, and performance metrics used. By leveraging cheaper simulations, our approach enables performant and accurate inference on high-fidelity models while substantially reducing computational costs.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>Optimized quantum sensor networks for ultralight dark matter detection</strong>, Adriel I. Santoso et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21188v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.21188v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter (DM) remains one of the most compelling unresolved problems in fundamental physics, motivating the search for new detection approaches. We propose a network-based quantum sensor architecture to enhance sensitivity to ultralight DM fields. Each node in the network is a superconducting qubit, interconnected via controlled-Z gates in symmetric topologies such as line, ring, star, and fully connected graphs. We investigate four- and nine-qubit systems, optimizing both state preparation and measurement using a variational quantum metrology framework. This approach minimizes the quantum and classical Cramer-Rao bounds to identify optimal configurations. Bayesian inference is employed to extract the DM-induced phase shift from measurement outcomes. Our results show that optimized network configurations significantly outperform conventional GHZ-based protocols while maintaining shallow circuit depths compatible with noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. Sensitivity remains robust under local dephasing noise. These findings highlight the importance of network structure in quantum sensing and point toward scalable strategies for quantum-enhanced DM detection.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>Possible wormholes in generalized geometry-matter coupling gravity induced by the Dekel-Zhao dark matter profile</strong>, A. Errehymy et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21081v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.21081v1</a></p>

<p>In the late 1980s, Morris and Thorne led in theoretical physics by creating solutions to wormholes and formulating the crucial requirements for safe traversability of wormholes. They found that exotic matter must meet the requirement $P_r + \rho &lt; 0$, where $P_r$ is radial pressure and $\rho$ is energy density. This is a rudimentary grasp of our understanding of general relativity. In this paper, we continue their excellent work by looking at how to build traversable wormhole solutions in an extended theory of gravity. We adopt a process of linearly modifying the matter Lagrangian and the energy-momentum tensor with some coupling strengths $\lambda$ and $\chi$. This may be considered as a special case of linear $f(R, T)$ gravity with matter coupling variability or as an additively separable simple $f(R, L_m, T)$ model. We undertake a detailed analysis of static wormhole solutions with a constant redshift function. This allows us to present our results as a first-order approximation in the $f(R, L_m, T)$ scenario. We derive the wormhole shape function from the Dekel-Zhao dark matter distribution in such a way that our solutions satisfy the needed conditions for traversability as well as the requirement of exotic matter. This is particularly exciting as it shows that wormholes in $f(R, L_m, T)$ gravity can sustain both exotic as well as ordinary matter. To ensure that the shape function meets the requirement of flaring-out and is asymptotically flat, we place some constraints on the couplings. We also examine the gravitational lensing effects, which exhibit a repulsive gravitational force that appears in our extended gravity for positive couplings.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>Scalarization and superradiant instability of black hole induced by dark matter halo in the scalar-tensor theory of gravity</strong>, Junya Tanaka et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20919v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.20919v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate whether a black hole(BH) surrounded by a dark matter (DM) halo has scalar hair/superradiant instability in the scalar tensor theory of gravity. In the scalar tensor theory, the coupling of matter and the scalar field creates effective mass, this effective mass causes the hairless BH to have scalar hair (spontaneous Scalarization). In the case of rotating BHs, it is also known that if the sign of the effective mass is positive, superradiant instability can occur instead of scalarization. Our study applies this effect to BHs with dark matter haloes. As a result, we confirmed that scalarization and superradiant instability occur in some of the parameter regions. In the case of small haloes, the size and mass of the halo affect the strength of scalarization, but not for astronomically large haloes, where the dependence on the coupling constant $\alpha$ is stronger. In the case of superradiance, we also confirm that for small haloes, the size and mass of the halo affect the strength of the instability and the number of unstable modes.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>Magnetically arrested transmutation of a compact star</strong>, H. A. Adarsha et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20722v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.20722v1</a></p>

<p>We introduce a novel mechanism â Magnetically Arrested Transmutation (MAT) â to account for the observed absence of ordinary pulsars near the Galactic centre, a longstanding puzzle known as the missing pulsar problem and the over-representation of magnetic white dwarfs in the same region. In this scenario, compact stars capture and accumulate dark matter, eventually forming an endoparasitic black hole (EBH) of initial mass $M_0$ at their core. Although such EBHs generally grow by accreting host matter, we show that sufficiently strong core magnetic fields can establish pressure equilibrium, thereby stalling further accretion and halting the starâs transmutation into a black hole. We derive the conditions for MAT to occur, identifying a critical parameter $\beta$, which encapsulates the interplay between the magnetic field strength, host matter density, and EBH mass. For $0 &lt; \beta \leq 4/27$, the growth of the EBH is arrested, limiting its final mass ($M_{\rm f}$) to $M_0 &lt; M_{\rm f} \leq 3/2 M_0$, whereas for $\beta &gt; 4/27$, full transmutation may ensue. This framework offers a plausible unified explanation for the absence of ordinary pulsars and the survival of the magnetar PSR J1745-2900, and the elevated population of magnetic white dwarfs, in the Galactic centre, and hence could be tested and should have implications for understanding dark matter and compact objects.</p>

<p>We investigate the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) with dark matter in a higher-dimensional AdS black hole spacetime including full back reaction, revealing its role as a diagnostic tool for critical phenomena in strongly coupled systems. By analyzing the HEE, we uncover distinct signatures of the metal/superconductor phase transition, demonstrating that the critical temperature is dynamically tuned by both the dark matter coupling strength and the chemical potential ratio between visible and dark matter sectors. Notably, near the criticality, the HEE exhibits a novel scaling behavior: it grows linearly with the dark matter coupling but displays a nonlinear, accelerated enhancement as the chemical potential ratio between the Maxwell and dark matter sectors increases.</p>

<p>Machine learning can accelerate cosmological inferences that involve many sequential evaluations of computationally expensive data vectors. Previous works in this series have examined how machine learning architectures impact emulator accuracy and training time for optical shear and galaxy clustering 2-point function. In this final manuscript, we explore neural network performance when emulating Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization power spectra. We maximize the volume of applicability in the parameter space of our emulators within the standard $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter model while ensuring that errors are below cosmic variance. Relative to standard multi-layer perceptron architectures, we find the dot-product-attention mechanism reduces the number of outliers among testing cosmologies, defined as the fraction of testing points with $\Delta \chi^2 &gt; 0.2$ relative to \textsc{CAMB} outputs, for a wide range of training set sizes. Such precision enables attention-based emulators to be directly applied to real data without requiring any additional correction via importance sampling. Combined with pre-processing techniques and optimized activation and loss functions, attention-based models can meet the precision criteria set by current and future CMB and lensing experiments. For each of Planck, Simons Observatory, CMB S4, and CMB HD, we find the fraction of outlier points to be less than $10\%$ with around $2\times10^5$ to $4\times10^5$ training data vectors. We further explore the applications of these methods to supernova distance, weak lensing, and galaxy clustering, as well as alternative architectures and pre-processing techniques.</p>

<p>Recently, the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI survey have suggested hints of dynamical dark energy, challenging the standard $\Lambda $CDM model. In this work, we adopt an improved inverse distance ladder approach based on the latest cosmological data to provide a model-independent perspective, employing a global parametrization based on cosmic age (PAge). Our analysis incorporates DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and type Ia supernovae (SNe) observations from either the DESY5 or PantheonPlus datasets. For the DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets, we obtain $H_0 = 67.91 \pm 2.33~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$. This value is consistent with the Planck 2018 result, while shows $2.0 \sigma$ tension with the SH0ES measurement. Furthermore, by mapping specific cosmological models into PAge approximation parameter space $(p_{\mathrm{age}}, \eta)$, our model-independent analysis reveals a notable deviation from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model, as indicated by the DESY5 and DESI DR2 datasets. Finally, DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets provide nearly decisive evidence favoring the PAge model over the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the expansion history to better understand the deviations from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model.</p>

<p>We consider the 21\,cm brightness temperature as a probe of the Hubble tension in the framework of an inhomogeneous cosmological model. Employing Buchertâs averaging formalism to study the effect of inhomogeneities on the background evolution, we consider scaling laws for the backreaction and curvature consistent with structure formation simulations. We calibrate the effective matter density using MCMC analysis using Union 2.1 Supernova Ia data. Our results show that a higher Hubble constant ($\sim73$\,km/s/Mpc) leads to a shallower absorption feature in the brightness temperature versus redshift curve. On the other hand, a lower value ($\sim67$\,km/s/Mpc) produces a remarkable dip in the brightness temperature $T_{21}$. Such a substantial difference is absent in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings indicate that inhomogeneities could significantly affect the 21\,cm signal, and may shed further light on the different measurements of the Hubble constant.</p>

<p>Precise cosmological constraints from type Ia supernovae require adequately accurate corrections for host-galaxy extinction. Modelling these corrections is challenged by the problem of disentangling supernova intrinsic colours from host-galaxy interstellar reddening.The latter is commonly modelled in a probabilistic way assuming an exponential distribution exp(-E(B-V)/\tau) as a universal prior which is applied across all types of supernova host galaxies. We test the robustness of the exponential model and its universality against predictions based on simulating dust and type Ia supernova distributions in host galaxies of different morphological types. We find substantial differences between predicted interstellar reddening in late- and early-type host galaxies, primarily driven by the stellar-to-dust mass ratios. The mean simulated reddening in late-type galaxies matches well those derived from type Ia supernova observations, but it is significantly lower for early-type host galaxies. The reddening distributions exhibit an excess of sight lines with vanishing reddening with respect to the exponential model, although the difference is quite mild for late-type galaxies. On the other hand, the distribution may peak at E(B-V)&gt;0 when considering a population of young type Ia supernovae originating from lower heights within the dust disc. We demonstrate that assuming a universal reddening prior distribution for modeling peak magnitude-colour relation, which is currently a common practice, gives rise to a spurious scatter in the derived extinction properties. It may also bias relative distances between supernovae originating from different host-galaxy populations. The discrepancy between the simulated reddening in average early-type host galaxies and the observed occurrence of reddened supernovae suggests that reddening does not originate from interstellar dust expected in these galaxies.</p>

<p>2025-05-28, <strong>The Kick Velocity Distribution of Isolated Neutron Stars</strong>, Paul Disberg et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22102v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.22102v1</a></p>

<p>Neutron stars (NSs) are thought to receive natal kicks at their formation in supernovae. In order to investigate the magnitude of these kicks, we analyze the proper motions and distance estimates â either through parallax or dispersion measures â of young isolated pulsars and infer their three-dimensional velocities relative to their local standard of rest. We find that the velocities based on parallax distances of pulsars younger than $10$ Myr follow a log-normal distribution with a mean of $\ln\left(v/\text{km}/\text{s}^{-1}\right)=5.60\pm0.12$ and a standard deviation of $0.68\pm0.10$, peaking at ${\sim}150$â$200$ km s$^{-1}$, which we adopt as our fiducial kick distribution. Using a previously established method that infers kick magnitudes through the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories, we also estimate the kick velocities of older pulsars, which we find to be consistent with our fiducial kick distribution. A log-normal fit to all pulsars with ages below $40$ Myr yields a more constraining (but possibly more prone to systematic errors) fit with mean and standard deviation of $5.67\pm0.10$ and $0.59\pm0.08$, respectively. Moreover, we (1) resolve the tension between our results and the Maxwellian distribution found by Hobbs et al. (2005), which has a ${\sim}50\%$ higher median velocity, by showing that their analysis is missing a Jacobian needed to correct for its logarithmic histogram bin sizes, and (2) argue that the bimodality found by others is not statistically significant and that previous results are consistent with our inferred kick distribution, effectively reconciling the literature on observed NS kicks.</p>

<p>Cosmic strings, topological defects predicted by high-energy theories, may contribute to the late-time expansion of the Universe, effectively mimicking dynamical dark energy. We investigate four phenomenological extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model involving a residual string network: (i) a non-relativistic component with positive energy density (Model~1), (ii) a velocity-dependent extension (Model~2), (iii) a non-relativistic string network with energy density allowed to take both positive and negative values (Model~3), and (iv) a general scenario with free energy and velocity parameters (Model~4). These models are constrained using \textit{Planck} CMB data, SDSS or DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae observations. Models~1 and~2 yield strong upper bounds on the string density, for example, $\Omega_{\mathrm{s}} &lt; 0.00901$ at 95\% CL from the CMB+DESI+DESY5 combination for Model~2, and mildly shift the inferred value of $H_0$ upward, though they are not favored by Bayesian evidence. For the same combination, the bulk velocity is bound as $v_{\mathrm{s}} &lt; 0.569$. Models~3 and~4 exhibit a consistent preference for slightly negative values of $\Omega_{\mathrm{s}}$, with CMB-only data yielding $\Omega_{\mathrm{s}} = -0.038^{+0.029}_{-0.022}$ and $v_{\mathrm{s}}&lt; 0.574$ in Model~4, and a best-fit improvement of $\Delta \chi^2 = -6.07$. However, these improvements are not sufficient to overcome the Occam penalty, and the Bayesian evidence continues to favor $\Lambda$CDM. These findings demonstrate the power of current data to constrain exotic energy components and encourage further exploration of string-inspired extensions to $\Lambda$CDM, particularly those involving negative-tension networks.</p>

<p>In Limongi et al. (2024) we presented and discussed the main evolutionary properties and final fate of stars in the mass range 7-15 Msun. The evolutions of those models were computed by means of a medium size nuclear network that guaranteed a proper calculation of the nuclear energy generation and hence a good modeling of the physical evolution of these stars. In the present paper, we extend this study by computing the detailed chemical yields of stars in the mass range 9-15 Msun, i.e., those stars that explode as core collapse supernovae (CCSNe). The explosive nucleosynthesis is then computed in the framework of the thermal bomb induced explosion by means of the HYPERION code (Limongi and Chieffi 2020). We find that: (1) the yields of the intermediate mass elements (i.e., O to P) show a steep decrease as the inital mass decreases; (2) the yields of s-weak component, i.e., those produced by the slow neutron captures from Ga to to the first neutron closure shell, decrease almost linearly as a function of the initial mass with respect to the ones produced by the more massive stars; (3) the global contribution of the stars in the mass range 9.22-13 Msun to the yields of a generation of massive stars averaged over a standard initial mass function is negligible for essentially all the isotopes. In spite of this, however, the models of stars in this mass range can be fundamental to interpret the observations of specific supernovae.</p>

<p>Understanding the evolution of dust in galaxies is crucial because it affects the dynamics and cooling of gas, star formation, and chemical evolution. Recent work on dust removal in galaxies indicates timescales of gigayears, with old stellar populations and AGNs as the primary drivers of this process. However, most statistically significant studies are focused on low redshifts $z &lt; 0.4$. Here, we determine the dust removal timescale in galaxies over a wide range of redshifts, up to $z \sim 5$. We use publicly available catalogue data of infrared-selected galaxies, observed by \textit{Herschel}. Using the inferred dust masses, stellar masses, and stellar ages, we calculate the dust removal timescale in a sample of more than 120,000 galaxies. We find that, with increasing redshift, the dust removal timescale decreases from 1.8 Gyr at redshift $z \sim 0.05$ to less than 500\,Myr at $z &gt; 3$. Galaxies at higher redshifts undergo more efficient dust removal than galaxies at lower redshift, likely driven by AGN activity, supernova shocks, and astration. These findings indicate that dust removal evolves over cosmic time, reflecting the changing mechanisms regulating dust content of galaxies as the Universe evolves.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>Teleparallel dark energy in a nonflat universe</strong>, Rocco DâAgostino et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21359v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.21359v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we investigate the cosmological dynamics of teleparallel dark energy in the presence of nonzero spatial geometry. Extending previous analyses of nonminimal scalar-tensor theories in the torsion-based framework, we consider different scalar field potentials and examine the resulting background evolution and linear perturbations. Adopting a dynamical systems approach, we reformulate the field equations and constrain the model parameters via a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis combining updated datasets from Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae, cosmic chronometers, and growth rate measurements. Our results suggest a mild preference for an open geometry, although all models remain consistent with a flat universe at the $1\sigma$ level. Notably, Bayesian information criteria indicate that the nonflat teleparallel scenario with a vanishing potential is strongly favored over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, all teleparallel scenarios are compatible with local determinations of the Hubble constant and exhibit better agreement with low-redshift structure formation data compared to $\Lambda$CDM. These findings highlight the potential of nonflat teleparallel gravity to address current observational tensions and motivate its further investigation as a viable alternative to standard cosmology.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>Rapid binary mass transfer: Circumbinary outflows and angular momentum losses</strong>, Peter Scherbak et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21264v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.21264v1</a></p>

<p>High rates of stable mass transfer likely occur for some binary star systems, but the resulting flow of mass and angular momentum (AM) is unclear. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a polytropic donor star and a point mass secondary to determine the mass, AM, and velocity of gas that escapes the system, and the dependence on binary parameters such as mass ratio. The simulations use an adiabatic equation of state and do not include any radiative cooling or irradiation of the outflow. Mass transfer is initiated by injecting heat into the stellar envelope, causing it to gradually inflate and overflow its Roche lobe. The transferred mass flows into an accretion disk, but soon begins to escape through the outer Lagrange point (L2), with a lesser amount escaping through the L3 point. This creates an equatorially concentrated circumbinary outflow with an opening angle of 10 to 30 degrees with a wind-like density profile $\rho \propto r^{-2}$. We find that the ratios of the specific AM of the outflowing gas over that of the L2 point are approximately {0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.65} for binary mass ratios $q$ (accretor/donor) of {0.25, 0.5, 1, 2}. The asymptotic radial velocity of the outflowing gas, in units of the binary orbital velocity, is approximately 0.1 to 0.2 for the same mass ratios, except for $q=0.25$ where it might be higher. This outflow, if ultimately unbound from the binary, may be a source of circumstellar material that will interact with ejecta from a subsequent supernova or stellar merger.</p>

<p>The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. These calculations are usually evaluated at the order-of-magnitude level for stellar populations where the DM density is highest, such as galactic centers. However, if the signature implies the destruction of the host star, their population could have been diminished over a Hubble time in the most DM-dense regions, unless replenished by star formation. This circumstance exemplifies the need for galactic star formation history profiles when deriving DM-induced transient rates, in particular for predicting the host-offset distribution. Here, we combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and efficient framework that permits us to estimate the target population formation rate and mass function within galactocentric radial zones across galaxy stellar masses and cosmic time. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to the hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the ignition of normal type Ia supernovae when colliding with white dwarf stars.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>What triggers type Ia supernovae: Prompt detonations from primordial black holes or companion stars?</strong>, Heinrich Steigerwald et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21256v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.21256v1</a></p>

<p>We set up and perform collision rate simulations between dark matter in the form of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) and white dwarf stars. These encounters trigger prompt detonations and could be the key to solving the ignition mystery of type Ia supernovae. Our framework is flexible enough to cover the full range of progenitor white dwarf masses, host galaxy stellar masses, galactocentric radial offsets, and cosmic time. The rate distribution pattern is consistent with exhaustive literature observational determinations for a slightly extended log-normal PBH mass spectrum. Most strikingly, the so far unexplained brightness distribution comes out without finetuning. We find no severe contradictions, except that the inferred PBH mass scale is unpredicted from first principles.</p>

<p>2025-05-27, <strong>A joint analysis of 3D clustering and galaxy \times CMB-lensing cross-correlations with DESI DR1 galaxies</strong>, M. Maus et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20656v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.20656v1</a></p>

<p>The spectroscopic data from DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) galaxies enables the analysis of 3D clustering by fitting galaxy power spectra and reconstructed correlation functions in redshift space. Given low measurements of the amplitude of structure from cosmic shear at $z\sim1$, redshift space distortions (RSD) + Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signals from DESI galaxies combined with weak lensing can break degeneracies and provide a tight alternative constraint on the $z\sim1$ amplitude of structure. In this paper we perform joint analyses that combine full-shape + post-reconstruction information from the DESI DR1 BGS and LRG samples along with angular cross-correlations with Planck PR4 and ACT DR6 CMB lensing maps. We show that adding galaxy-lensing cross-correlations tightens clustering amplitude constraints, improving $\sigma_8$ uncertainties by $\sim 40\%$ over RSD+BAO alone. We also include angular galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-lensing spectra using photometric samples from the DESI Legacy Survey to further improve constraints. Our headline results are $\sigma_8 = 0.803\pm 0.017$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.3037\pm 0.0069$, and $S_8 = 0.808\pm 0.017$. Given DESIâs preference for higher $\sigma_8$ compared to lower values from BOSS, we perform a catalog-level comparison of LRG samples from both surveys. We test sensitivity to dark energy assumptions by relaxing our $\Lambda$CDM prior and allowing for evolving dark energy via the $w_0-w_a$ parameterization. We find our $S_8$ constraints to be relatively unchanged despite a $~3.5\sigma$ tension with the cosmological constant model when combining with the Union3 supernova likelihood. Finally we test general relativity (GR) by allowing the gravitational slip parameter ($\gamma$) to vary, and find $\gamma = 1.17\pm0.11$ in mild ($\sim1.5\sigma$) tension with the GR value of $1.0$.</p>

<p>Using high-precision photometric data from TESS, medium resolution spectroscopic data from LAMOST, and long-term eclipse timings, we provide orbital parameters for two early-type detached eclipsing binary systems: TYC 3740-2072-1 and TYC 2888-780-1, and analyze the orbital period variations and evolutionary status of these two targets. TYC 3740-2072-1, with a spectral type of B1V, consists of a $6.914 M_\odot$ subgiant and a $6.233 M_\odot$ main-sequence component. It is expected to evolve into a semi-detached binary, potentially serving as a progenitor of a Type Ia supernova. TYC 2888-780-1 has a spectral type of A3 and consists of two main-sequence components with masses of $1.682 M_\odot$ and $1.673 M_\odot$, respectively. It is undergoing stable evolution. Through eclipse timing analysis, we find that both targets exhibit apsidal motion effects, with observed AM rates of $\dot{\omega}_{obs} = 0.0412~\text{deg}~\text{cycle}^{-1}$ and $\dot{\omega}_{obs} = 0.0205~\text{deg}~\text{cycle}^{-1}$, respectively. Additionally, TYC 2888-780-1 exhibits orbital period variations, which we attribute to the light travel time effect caused by a third body, the minimum mass of this third body is estimated to be $0.598 M_\odot$.</p>
