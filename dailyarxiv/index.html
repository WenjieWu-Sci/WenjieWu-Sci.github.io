<p>2023-08-24, <strong>Prospects for the detection of transient neutrino sources with PLEnuM</strong>, Lisa Johanna Schumacher et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12759v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.12759v1</a></p>

<p>The discovery of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV range by IceCube marked the start of neutrino astronomy, and the search for their sources continues. Two promising source candidates have been identified by IceCube: NGC 1068 in the 1 TeV-10 TeV range and TXS 0506+056 in the 0.1-1 PeV range. Both sources have gamma-ray counterparts, but additional time information of both neutrinos and gamma rays were essential for the identification of TXS 0506+056. The Planetary Neutrino Monitoring (PLEnuM) concept is an approach for combining the exposures of all current and future neutrino observatories - such as KM3NeT, Baikal-GVD, P-ONE in the Northern Hemisphere, and IceCube-Gen2 in the Southern Hemisphere. Using this PLEnuM approach, we estimate how the detection capability for transient sources candidates like blazars and GRBs improves once the future neutrino observatories come online. In addition, we present how the combined, instantaneous field of view of PLEnuM improves the real-time detection rate of rare, very-high-energy neutrinos across the entire sky.</p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a one-cubic-kilometer-sized neutrino telescope deployed deep in the Antarctic ice at the South Pole. One of IceCube’s major goals is finding the origins of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos. In 2022, IceCube identified the strongest point-like neutrino source so far, the active galaxy NGC 1068. Analyzing 9 years of muon-neutrino data from the Northern Sky recorded between 2011 and 2020, the emission from NGC 1068 is significant at 4.2$\,\sigma$. We present a planned extension to this search with additional years of data. One of these years includes data from 2010 when IceCube was only partially constructed. We discuss the improvement in sensitivity and discovery potential for neutrino point sources across the Northern sky. We show that by building on the established analysis techniques, previous observations could be improved, not only for NGC 1068 but for all possible sources in the Northern sky.</p>

<p>2023-08-24, <strong>Extending SkyLLH software for neutrino point source analyses with 10 years of IceCube public data</strong>, Chiara Bellenghi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12733v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.12733v1</a></p>

<p>Searching for the sources of high-energy cosmic particles requires sophisticated analysis techniques, frequently involving hypothesis tests with unbinned log-likelihood (LLH) functions. SkyLLH is an open-source, Python-based software tool to build these LLH functions and perform likelihood-ratio tests. We present a new easy-to-use and modular extension of SkyLLH that allows the user to perform neutrino point source searches in the entire sky using ten years of IceCube public data. To guide the user, SkyLLH provides tutorials showing how to analyze the experimental data and calculate useful statistical quantities. Here we describe the details of the analysis workflow and illustrate some of the possible methods to work with the IceCube public dataset. Additionally, we show that SkyLLH can reproduce the results from a previous IceCube publication that used the public data release. We obtain a similar local significance for the neutrino emission from a list of candidate sources within a maximum shift of 0.5$\sigma$. Finally, the measured neutrino flux from the most significant source candidate, NGC 1068, shows substantial agreement with the previously published result.</p>

<p>2023-08-24, <strong>Chiral perturbative reconstruction of the complex orthogonal matrix $R$ in Casas–Ibarra parameterization</strong>, Masaki J. S. Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12718v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.12718v1</a></p>

<p>In this letter, we perform a chiral perturbative analysis by singular values $m_{Di}$ of the Dirac mass matrix $m_{D}$ for the type-I seesaw mechanism. In the basis where $m_{D} = V m_{D}^{\rm diag} U^{\dagger}$ is diagonal, the mass matrix of right-handed neutrinos $M_{R}$ is written by $M_{R} = m_{D}^{\rm diag} m^{-1} m_{D}^{\rm diag}$. If the mass matrix of light neutrinos $m$ has an inverse matrix and the singular values $m_{Di}$ are hierarchical ($m_{D1} \ll m_{D2} \ll m_{D3}$), the singular values $M_{i}$ and diagonalization matrix $U$ of $M_{R}$ are obtained perturbatively.   By treating $m_{Di}$ and $V$ as input parameters, $m_{D}$ is represented in the basis where $M_{R}$ is diagonal, and we perturbatively derive the orthogonal matrix $R$ in Casas–Ibarra parameterization. As a result, $R$ is independent of $m_{Di}$ in the leading order, and it is reconstructed as an orthonormal basis $R_{i1} \simeq \pm \sqrt{m_{i} / m_{11} } (U_{\rm MNS}^{T} V^{*})_{i1} \, ,   R_{i2} \simeq \pm \epsilon_{ijk} R_{j3} R_{k1} \, ,   R_{i3} \simeq \pm {(U_{\rm MNS}^{\dagger} V)_{i3} / \sqrt {m_{i} (m^{-1})_{33}} } $. Here, $m_{i}$ is the masses of light neutrinos and $\pm$ denotes the independent degree of freedom for each column vector.</p>

<p>2023-08-24, <strong>The classification and categorisation of Gamma-Ray Bursts with machine learning techniques for neutrino detection</strong>, Karlijn Kruiswijk et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12672v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.12672v1</a></p>

<p>While Gamma-Ray Burst (GRBs) are clear and distinct observed events, every individual GRB is unique. In fact, GRBs are known for their variable behaviour, and BATSE was already able to discover two categories of GRB from the T90 distribution; the short and long GRBs. These two categories match up with the expected two types of GRB progenitors. Nowadays, more features have been found to be able to further distinguish them, such as the hardness ratio or the presence of supernovae. However, that does not mean that it is by any means simple to categorise individual GRBs. Furthermore, more GRB categories have been theorised as well, such as low-luminosity or X-ray-rich GRBs. These different types of GRBs also could indicate a different neutrino spectrum, with different types of GRBs more likely to emit higher amounts of neutrinos. We present an ongoing effort to use machine learning to categorise and classify GRBs, searching for subpopulations that could yield a larger neutrino flux. We specifically use unsupervised learning, as it allows hidden patterns and correlations to come to light. With the help of features such as the T90, hardness, fluence, SNR, spectral index and even the full light curve and spectra, different structures and categories of Gamma-Ray bursts can be found.</p>

<p>2023-08-24, <strong>The gamma-ray burst arising from neutrino pair annihilation in the static and spherically symmetric black-hole-like wormholes</strong>, Yuxuan Shi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12602v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.12602v1</a></p>

<p>We look into the neutrino-antineutrino pair ($\nu+\bar{\nu}\longrightarrow e^{-}+e^{+}$) annihilation in the Damour-Solodukhin wormhole spacetime whose metric component involves a shift in contrast to the similar black hole. The deep analysis of the surface temperature of the accretion disk of static, spherically symmetric black-hole-like wormholes from R. Kh. Karimov et.al. reveals that the accretion disks of the wormholes are hotter than that of comparable black holes, indicating that the wormholes accretion disk can release neutrinos. Further we investigate the energy deposition rate from the neutrino pair annihilation around the Damour-Solodukhin wormhole thought as a mimicker of Schwarzschild black hole. By comparison made between the black-hole-like wormhole and the similar black hole, we demonstrate that the wormhole’s accretion disk drawing the annihilation can become a source of gamma-ray burst although the more significant deviation from the similar black hole reduces the emitted power slightly. The ratio of energy deposition per unit time from the annihilation surrounding the accretion disk of the Damour-Solodukhin wormhole over the emitting power of black hole might alter noticeably depending on how slightly the metrics of the wormhole differ from the black hole spacetime.</p>

<p>2023-08-24, <strong>Sterile Neutrino Portal Dark Matter from Semi-Production</strong>, Ang Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12588v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.12588v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we study the feeble sterile neutrino portal dark matter under the $Z_3$ symmetry. The dark sector consists of one fermion singlet $\chi$ and one scalar singlet $\chi$, which transforms as $\chi\to e^{i2\pi/3}\chi, \phi\to e^{i2\pi/3}\phi$ under the $Z_3$ symmetry. Regarding fermion singlet $\chi$ as the dark matter candidate, the new interaction terms $y_\chi \phi \bar{\chi^c}\chi$ and $\mu\phi^3/2$ could induce various new production channels. For instance, when $m_\phi&gt;2m_\chi$, the pair decay $\phi\to\chi\chi$ could be the dominant channel, rather than the delayed decay $\phi\to\chi\nu$. Another appealing scenario is when the dark sector is initially produced through the scattering process as $NN\to\chi\chi, NN\to\phi\phi,h\nu\to\chi\phi$, then the semi-production processes $N \chi\to\phi\phi, N\phi\to\phi\chi, N\chi\to\chi\chi$ could lead to the exponential growth of dark sector abundances. The phenomenology of sterile neutrino and the cosmological impact of the dark scalar are also considered in the $Z_3$ symmetric model.</p>

<p>2023-08-24, <strong>Test the Weak Cosmic Supervision Conjecture in Dark Matter-Black Hole System</strong>, Liping Meng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12913v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.12913v1</a></p>

<p>There is a possibility that the event horizon of a Kerr-like black hole with perfect fluid dark matter (DM) can be destroyed, providing a potential opportunity for understanding the weak cosmic censorship conjecture of black holes. In this study, we analyze the influence of the intensity parameter of perfect fluid DM on the destruction of the event horizon of a Kerr-like black hole with spinning after injecting test particles and scalar fields. We find that, when test particles are incident on the black hole, the event horizon is destroyed by perfect fluid dark matter for extreme black holes. For nearly extreme black holes, when the dark matter parameter satisfies $\alpha \in \left (-r_{h} , 0\right ) \cup \left ( r_{h} ,+ \infty \right )$ i.e.$(A&lt;0)$, the event horizon of the black hole will not be destroyed; when the dark matter parameter satisfies $\alpha \in\left ( -\infty ,-r_{h} \right ]\cup \left[0,r_{h}\right ]$ i.e.$(A\ge 0)$, the event horizon of the black hole will be destroyed. When a classical scalar field is incident into the black hole in the extremal black hole case, we find that the range of mode patterns of the scalar field that can disrupt the black hole event horizon is different for different values of the ideal fluid dark matter intensity parameter. In the nearly extremal black hole case, through our analysis, we have found when $\alpha\neq0 $ and $\alpha\neq\pm\ r_h$ i.e.$A\neq0$, the event horizon of the black hole can be disrupted. Our research results indicate that dark matter might be capable of breaking the black hole horizon, thus potentially violating the weak cosmic censorship conjecture.</p>

<p>2023-08-24, <strong>Low Fine-Tuning with Heavy Higgsinos in Yukawa Unified SUSY GUTs</strong>, Cem Salih Un et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12862v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.12862v1</a></p>

<p>The work presented considers a class of minimally constructed Yukawa unified SUSY GUTs - NUHM2 - and explore their implications when their soft supersymmetry breaking Lagrangian is generalized by the non-holomorphic terms which provide extra contributions to the Higgsino mass and couple the supersymmetric scalar fields to the wrong Higgs doublets. With such a simple extension, it can be found several regions with interesting implications which cannot be realized in the usual restricted models. It is observed that the Yukawa unification solutions can be compatible with relatively light mass spectrum and acceptable low fine-tuning measurements. In the restricted models such effects can directly be addressed to the non-holomorphic terms. They can provide a slight improvement in the SM-like Higgs boson mass without altering the mass spectrum too much, and they can accommodate relatively lighter sbottom and stau masses, while they do not change the stop sector much. The dark matter can be Higgsino-like or Bino-like, but the experimental relic density measurements favor the Higgsino-like dark matter, while the Bino-like dark matter is predicted with a quite large relic density. Also several coannihilation scenarios are identified in the Higgsino-like dark matter regions, while the Bino-like dark matter do not allow any of such coannihilation processes. The presence of the non-holomorphic terms can weaken the impact from the phenomenological or indirect constraints such as low fine-tuning, Yukawa unification and rare decays of $B-$meson, the direct and model independent constraints still yield a strong strike on the solutions. Such constraints are discussed in regard of the current collider analyses on $\tau\tau$ events and direct detection of dark matter experiments.</p>

<p>2023-08-24, <strong>Dark Mater Interactions From An Extra U(1) gauge symmetry with kinetic mixing and Higgs charge</strong>, Lianyou Shan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12663v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.12663v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate fermionic dark matter interactions with standard model particles from an additional $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{X}$ gauge symmetry, assuming kinetic mixing between the $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{X}$ and $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{Y}$ gauge fields as well as a nonzero $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{X}$ charge of the Higgs doublet. For ensuring gauge-invariant Yukawa interactions and the cancellation of gauge anomalies, the standard model fermions are assigned $Y$-sequential $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{X}$ charges proportional to the Higgs charge. Although the Higgs charge should be small due to collider constraints, it is useful to decrease the effective cross section of dark matter scattering off nucleons by two orders of magnitude and easier evade from direct detection bounds. After some numerical scans performed in the parameter space, we find that the introduction of the Higgs charge can also enhance the dark matter relic density by at least two orders of magnitude. When the observed relic density and the direct detection constraints are tangled, at the case where the resonance effect is important for dark matter freeze-out, the Higgs charge can expand physical windows to some extent by relieving the tension between the relic density and the direct detection.</p>

<p>2023-08-24, <strong>Relic abundance of dark matter with coannihilation in non-standard cosmological scenarios</strong>, Fangyu Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12556v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.12556v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the relic abundance of dark matter from coannihilation in non-standard cosmological scenarios. We explore the effect of coannihilation on the relic density of dark matter and freeze out temperature in quintessence model with kination phase and brane world cosmological scenarios. Since the Hubble expansion rate is enhanced in quintessence and brane world cosmological models, it causes the larger relic density comparing to the standard one. On the other hand, the relic density of dark matter is decreased due to the coannihilation in the standard cosmological scenario. In quintessence or brane world cosmological scenarios, we find the decrease of the relic density of dark matter is slightly slower than that in the standard cosmological scenario.</p>

<p>2023-08-24, <strong>Redback: A Bayesian inference software package for electromagnetic transients</strong>, Nikhil Sarin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12806v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.12806v1</a></p>

<p>Fulfilling the rich promise of rapid advances in time-domain astronomy is only possible through confronting our observations with physical models and extracting the parameters that best describe what we see. Here, we introduce {\sc Redback}; a Bayesian inference software package for electromagnetic transients. {\sc Redback} provides an object-orientated {\sc python} interface to over 12 different samplers and over 100 different models for kilonovae, supernovae, gamma-ray burst afterglows, tidal disruption events, engine-driven transients, X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts driven by millisecond magnetars among other explosive transients. The models range in complexity from simple analytical and semi-analytical models to surrogates built upon numerical simulations accelerated via machine learning. {\sc Redback} also provides a simple interface for downloading and processing data from Swift, Fink, Lasair, the open-access catalogues, and BATSE and fit this or private data. {\sc Redback} can also be used as an engine to simulate transients for telescopes such as the Zwicky Transient Facility and Vera Rubin with realistic cadences, limiting magnitudes, and sky-coverage or a hypothetical user-constructed survey with arbitrary settings. We also provide a more general simulation interface suitable for target of opportunity observations with different telescopes. We demonstrate through a series of examples how {\sc Redback} can be used as a tool to simulate a large population of transients for realistic surveys, fit models to real, simulated, or private data, multi-messenger inference and serve as an end-to-end software toolkit for parameter estimation and interpreting the nature of electromagnetic transients.</p>
