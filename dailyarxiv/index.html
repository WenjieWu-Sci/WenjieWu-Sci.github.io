<p>2025-03-04, <strong>Revolutionizing Command Interface: Maximizing Control Efficiency in INO ICAL Experiment with UDP Protocol</strong>, Yuvaraj Elangovan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02751v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.02751v1</a></p>

<p>Efficient command interface is a critical requirement for experiments employing a large number of front-end DAQ modules and control servers. In the context of the INOICAL (India-based Neutrino Observatory Iron Calorimeter) experiment, this involves 28,800 Resistive Plate Chamber(RPC), charged particle detectors. The acquisition and control of these detectors are facilitated through Front End data acquisition modules known as RPC-DAQs. These modules consists of Ethernet interfaces for data and command connectivity to a server. Each module acts as a network node with a unique IP address. The collective group of hundreds of modules is controlled by a common server over a Local Area Network (LAN). UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is the most commonly used networking protocol which supports Multicast as well as Unicast, can be easily adapted to INO ICAL Experiment. A server can send commands to group of DAQs or any particular DAQ. But UDP may have the problem of packet loss and reliability. To mitigate these issues, this paper suggests a simpler approach that modifies the UDP protocol by implementing a handshaking scheme and checksum, similar to those found in more reliable protocols like TCP. The proposed solution optimizes the use of UDP as a reliable command interface in the INO ICAL experiment, ensuring seamless data acquisition and control. Also, this paper shows the performance study of the custom hybrid UDP Command Interface in the prototype ICAL experiment called Mini Iron Calorimeter (Mini ICAL) which houses 20 units of RPCs and electronics. This work not only addresses the challenges of the INO ICAL experiment but also underscores the adaptability and robustness of the proposed protocol for usage in mini-ICAL and beyond.</p>

<p>2025-03-04, <strong>WIMP-FIMP option and neutrino masses via a novel anomaly-free B-L symmetry</strong>, Sarif Khan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02635v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.02635v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a novel $U(1)_{B-L}$ model with singlet dark matter fermions composed of WIMP and FIMP, which is anomaly-free without a need for introducing right-handed neutrinos. Fermion dark matter masses are generated after the $U(1)_{B-L}$ is broken spontaneously, so the Yukawa couplings for WIMP and FIMP components can be distinguished by the hierarchical values of the vacuum expectation values of the single scalar fields. Moreover, the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson receives a TeV-scale mass for a tiny extra gauge coupling, so it goes out of equilibrium from the rest of the model content in the early Universe. Both the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson and FIMP component are produced from the decays of the bath particles, and the former can decay into FIMP DM and/or WIMP DM before BBN. The WIMP component can reside in the resonance region of the Higgs bosons or dominantly annihilate into a pair of singlet-like scalars. Thus, there is a flexibility to choose a small mixing between the visible and dark sectors, thereby evading all the current direct and indirect detection bounds. Furthermore, we show that WIMP and FIMP components can coexist in suitable fractions, depending on the choice of model parameters, allowing for additional protection for WIMP DM against various experimental bounds. Finally, we identify the dimension-6 and dimension-7 operators for Majorana neutrino masses in our model, being consistent with the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry, and provide a possibility of extending the model with additional singlet fermions for neutrino masses.</p>

<p>2025-03-04, <strong>Constraints on 1-0 texture through neutrino phenomenology and dark matter in minimal inverse seesaw</strong>, Jotin Gogoi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02524v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.02524v1</a></p>

<p>In this work we have realized texture zero structures of neutrino mass matrix through our study of neutrino phenomenology and dark matter. For analysing these processes, we have constructed a model in minimal inverse seesaw, ISS(2,3) by using $A_4$ discrete symmetry. The particle content of ISS(2.3) has been augmented by a scalar triplet $\eta=(\eta_1,\eta_2,\eta_3)$. The probable dark matter candidates for this model are the neutral components of $\eta$. The three mass matices of ISS(2,3), $M_D$, $M_{NS}$ and $M_S$ contribute to the structure of light neutrino mass matrix $m_\nu$. Here we try to examine the impact on texture structures of $m_\nu$ due to different possible 2-0 structures of $M_D$. To examine further possible contraints, we have evaluated the neutrino parameters and calculated relic density of dark matter for the favourable cases. From our analysis we find that out of the fifteen possible 2-0 structures, only two of them ($M_{D3}$ and $M_{D6}$) successfully generates all the mixing angles in the allowed ranges.</p>

<p>2025-03-04, <strong>Anisotropic Lorentz invariance violation in reactor neutrino experiments</strong>, Hai-Xing Lin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02305v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.02305v1</a></p>

<p>Recent reactor neutrino oscillation experiments reported precision measurements of $\sin^2 2\theta_{13}$ and $\Delta m^2_{ee}$ under the standard 3$\nu$ oscillation framework. However, inter-experiment consistency checks through the parameter goodness-of-fit test reveals proximity to the tension boundary, with the Double Chooz, RENO, and Daya Bay ensemble yielding $p_\text{PG}=0.14$ vs threshold $\alpha=0.1$. Anisotropic Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) can accommodate this tension by introducing a location-dependent angle $\theta^\text{LIV}$ relative to the earthâs axis. It is found that anisotropic LIV improve the fit to data up to 1.9$\sigma$ confidence level significance, with the coefficient $\mathcal{A}^{C(0)}_{31} = 2.43\times 10^{-17}\text{ MeV}$ yielding the best fit, while Parameter Goodness-of-fit (PG) is significantly improved within the LIV formalism.</p>

<p>2025-03-04, <strong>Signatures of Einstein-Maxwell dilaton-axion gravity from the observed quasi-periodic oscillations in black holes</strong>, Anirban Dasgupta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02708v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.02708v1</a></p>

<p>String-inspired models are often believed to provide an interesting framework for quantum gravity and force unification with promising prospects to resolve issues like dark matter and dark energy which cannot be satisfactorily incorporated within the framework of general relativity (GR). The goal of the present work is to investigate the role of the Einstein-Maxwell dilaton-axion (EMDA) gravity arising in the low energy effective action of the heterotic string theory in explaining astrophysical observations, in particular, the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed in the power spectrum of black holes. EMDA gravity has interesting cosmological implications and hence it is worthwhile to explore the footprints of such a theory in available astrophysical observations. This requires one to study the stationary, axi-symmetric black hole solution in EMDA gravity, which corresponds to the Kerr-Sen spacetime. Such black holes are endowed with a dilatonic charge while the rotation is sourced from the axionic field. We investigate the orbital and epicyclic frequencies of matter rotating in the Kerr-Sen spacetime and consider eleven well-studied QPO models in this work. We compare the model dependent QPO frequencies with the available observations of five BH sources, namely, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1915+105, H 143+322, GRO J1655-40 and Sgr A*. Our analysis provides constrains on the spins of the aforesaid black holes which when compared with previous estimates enables us to understand the observationally favored QPO models for each of these sources. Further, from the current data the EMDA scenario cannot be ruled out in favor of general relativity. We comment on the implications and limitations of our finding and how the present constrains compare with the existing literature.</p>

<p>2025-03-04, <strong>Tripletino-like WIMP Dark Matter in the Supersymmetric Georgi-Machacek Model</strong>, LiangLiang Shang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02653v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.02653v1</a></p>

<p>The Supersymmetric Custodial Triplet Model (SCTM), a Supersymmetric generalization of the Georgi-Machacek (GM) model, is constructed by extending the Higgs sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model by three triplet chiral Superfields with hypercharge $Y=0,\pm 1$, in order to maintain the holomorphy of the Superpotential and satisfy the requirements of anomaly cancellation. The global $SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R$ symmetry has to be respected for the Superpotential and soft Supersymmetry breaking sector, where the former will only be broken by the Yukawa couplings and the latter one will be broken spontaneously to the custodial $SU(2)_V$ symmetry after Electro-Weak Symmetry Breaking similar as the GM model. The ensuing complicated spectrum not only gives rich collider phenomenology but also provides more available Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) Dark Matter (DM) candidates. In this paper, we explore the viability of WIMP solutions for DM in the SCTM, by considering the increasingly stringent constraints from direct detection DM experiments. Our numerical simulations show that a significant portion of the SCTM parameter space remains viable despite these constraints and will be fully tested in future experiments.</p>

<p>2025-03-04, <strong>Gravitational wave probes of particle dark matter: a review</strong>, Andrew L. Miller et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02607v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.02607v2</a></p>

<p>Various theories of dark matter predict distinctive astrophysical signatures in gravitational-wave sources that could be observed by ground- and space-based laser interferometers. Different candidates-including axions, dark photons, macroscopic dark matter, WIMPs, and dark-matter spikes-may appear in interferometer data via their coupling to gravity or the Standard Model, altering the measured gravitational-wave strain in distinct ways. Despite their differences, these candidates share two key features: (1) they can be probed through their effects on gravitational waves from inspiraling compact objects, isolated black holes, and neutron stars, or via direct interactions with detectors, and (2) their signatures likely persist far longer than the seconds-long mergers detected today, necessitating new data analysis methods beyond matched filtering. This review outlines these dark matter candidates, their observational signatures, and approaches for their detection.</p>

<p>2025-03-04, <strong>Universal Density and Velocity Distributions of Dark Matter around Massive Black Holes</strong>, Zi-Chang Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02573v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.02573v1</a></p>

<p>The distribution of dark matter at the galactic center, crucial for indirect searches, remains uncertain. In particular, in the vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of a galaxy where indirect signals may be stronger, the density of a dark matter spike may undergo redistribution. Here we calculate the density surrounding Schwarzschild black holes that originate from diverse initial dark halos and estimate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. By employing a series of Hernquist and power-law initial dark halos, we obtain a fitting formula between dark matter spikes and black hole masses. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is utilized to approximate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. As an application, taking into account dark matter self-annihilation, we assess the relic densities of dark matter spikes around black holes. We find that the relic spikes for s-wave annihilation are higher than p-wave annihilation, and the relic densities obtained for p-wave annihilation depend on the velocity distribution, varying significantly with distance. The findings shall further provide useful insights for multi-messenger dark matter detections in the future.</p>

<p>2025-03-04, <strong>An rf-SQUID-based traveling-wave parametric amplifier with -84 dBm input saturation power across more than one octave bandwidth</strong>, Victor Gaydamachenko et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02489v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.02489v1</a></p>

<p>Traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) have become an essential tool for the readout of quantum circuits and the search for dark matter. We report on the implementation of an rf-SQUID-based Josephson TWPA with an average saturation power of -84 dBm, while providing an average power gain of 20 dB from 3.5 to 8.5 GHz. This wide bandwidth is enabled by reducing the curvature of the dispersion in the signal band while suppressing detrimental mixing processes. With 2393 rf-SQUIDs our device has a comparable number of nonlinear elements, but achieves ten times higher saturation power than previous works, showing that using rf-SQUIDs results in a more favorable trade-off between device length and saturation power. Harnessing wideband characterization techniques we determine the TWPAâs excess noise above the quantum limit to be 0.8 to 1.5 photons. In addition, we validate signal-to-noise ratio improvement as a practical measure for tuning the TWPA to minimize the total system noise, and demonstrate that its optimum does not coincide with the highest gain.</p>

<p>2025-03-04, <strong>Searching for mirror neutrons and dark matter with cold neutron interferometry</strong>, Antonio Capolupo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02479v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.02479v1</a></p>

<p>We report a novel neutron interferometry scheme aimed at probing the potential existence of mirror neutrons, which have been proposed as viable dark matter candidates. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that if mirror neutrons exist, ordinary neutrons would acquire a measurable geometric phase as a result of their mixing with these mirror counterparts.</p>

<p>2025-03-04, <strong>Late Time Cosmic Acceleration in Modified Gravity and Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology</strong>, Santosh V. Lohakare et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02467v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.02467v1</a></p>

<p>This thesis focuses on late-time cosmic acceleration within modified theories of gravity, using various observational data sets and statistical analysis. The Universe is assumed to be spatially homogeneous and isotropic and is described by the Friedmann Lema\^{i}tre Robertson Walker metric. The late-time acceleration of the Universe has posed a significant challenge to contemporary cosmology. General relativity addresses this by introducing the cosmological constant, forming the basis of the standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM). However, this model has limitations, leading cosmologists to explore alternative explanations for late-time acceleration. These alternatives range from models involving a dynamic dark fluid known as dark energy, to large-scale modifications of gravitational interaction, known as modified gravity. The formulation of general relativity fundamentally changed our understanding of gravitation, redefining gravity as a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime rather than a force as described by Newton. Despite its success, general relativity has shown incompatibilities with observations, necessitating the introduction of dark matter and dark energyâ¦.</p>

<p>2025-03-04, <strong>Residual test to search for microlensing signatures in strongly lensed gravitational wave signals</strong>, Eungwang Seo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02186v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.02186v1</a></p>

<p>When a gravitational wave signal encounters a massive object, such as a galaxy or galaxy cluster, it undergoes strong gravitational lensing, producing multiple copies of the original signal. These strongly lensed signals exhibit identical waveform morphology in the frequency domain, allowing analysis without the need for complex lens models. However, stellar fields and dark matter substructures within the galactic lens introduce microlensing effects that alter individual signal morphologies. Identifying these microlensing signatures is computationally challenging within Bayesian frameworks. In this study, we propose a novel residual test to efficiently search for microlensing signatures by leveraging the fact that current Bayesian inference pipelines are optimized solely for the strong lensing hypothesis. Using cross-correlation techniques, we investigate the microlensing-induced deviations from the strong hypothesis, which are imprinted in the residuals. Our simulated signals from realistic microlensing populations reveal that while most events exhibit small mismatches, a fraction exhibit significant deviations. We find that 31% (55%) and 45% (65%) of microlensed events with mismatch &gt; 0.03 and &gt; 0.1, respectively, can be discerned with O4 (O5) detector sensitivities, which demonstrates that high-mismatch events are more likely to be identified as microlensed. Including all events from a realistic population, 12% (21.5%) are identifiable with O4 (O5) sensitivity using our approach.</p>

<p>2025-03-04, <strong>Super-enhanced Nuclear Fusion in Metal-like Systems and in Condensed Plasmas of Supernova Progenitors</strong>, Hidetsugu Ikegami et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02787v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.02787v1</a></p>

<p>In the scheme of chemonuclear reaction, bulk of itinerant s-electrons revealing the thermodynamical liquid activity in metallic systems undergo contact interaction with atomic nuclei and therein nucleons, inducing contagiously thermodynamical liquid activity among the bulk of nuclei under the irreversible action of Nature towards the chemical potential minimum resulting in the united spontaneous, irreversible atomic and nuclear reactions. The chemonuclear reaction, moreover, is enhanced with astronomical figures besides the enhancement of few particle processes (e.g., in the electron-screened pycnonuclear fusion). In the systems of metal-like hydride/deuteride and electron donor mixtures, self-sustained H-H and D-D chemonuclear fusion may take place. In these systems, however, some unforeseen phenomena are induced, e.g., radiation-less fusion and $\gamma$-ray missing positron annihilation.</p>

<p>2025-03-04, <strong>Inferring Galactic Parameters from Chemical Abundances with Simulation-Based Inference</strong>, Tobias Buck et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02456v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.02456v1</a></p>

<p>Galactic chemical abundances provide crucial insights into fundamental galactic parameters, such as the high-mass slope of the initial mass function (IMF) and the normalization of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rates. Constraining these parameters is essential for advancing our understanding of stellar feedback, metal enrichment, and galaxy formation processes. However, traditional Bayesian inference techniques, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), are computationally prohibitive when applied to large datasets of modern stellar surveys. We leverage simulation-based-inference (SBI) as a scalable, robust, and efficient method for constraining galactic parameters from stellar chemical abundances and demonstrate its the advantages over HMC in terms of speed, scalability, and robustness against model misspecifications. We combine a Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) model, CHEMPY, with a neural network emulator and a Neural Posterior Estimator (NPE) to train our SBI pipeline. Mock datasets are generated using CHEMPY, including scenarios with mismatched nucleosynthetic yields, with additional tests conducted on data from a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy. SBI results are benchmarked against HMC-based inference, focusing on computational performance, accuracy, and resilience to systematic discrepancies. SBI achieves a $\sim75,600\times$ speed-up compared to HMC, reducing inference runtime from $\gtrsim42$ hours to mere seconds for thousands of stars. Inference on $1,000$ stars yields precise estimates for the IMF slope ($\alpha_{\rm IMF} = -2.298 \pm 0.002$) and SN Ia normalization ($\log_{10}(N_{\rm Ia}) = -2.885 \pm 0.003$), deviating less than 0.05% from the ground truth.

<p>2025-03-04, <strong>SN 2021hpr: A Normal Type Ia Supernova Showing Excess Emission in the Early Rising Phase</strong>, Abdusamatjan Iskandar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02257v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.02257v1</a></p>

<p>We present extensive optical observations of a nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), SN 2021hpr, located in the spiral galaxy NGC 3147 at a distance of $\sim$ 45 Mpc. Our observations cover a phase within $\sim 1-2$ days to $\sim 290$ days after the explosion. SN 2021hpr is found to be a spectroscopically normal SN Ia, with an absolute B-band peak magnitude of $M_{max}(B) \approx -19.16 \pm 0.14$ mag and a post-peak decline rate of $\Delta m_{15}(B)= 1.00 \pm 0.01 $ mag. Early-time light curves showed a $\sim 7.0 \%$ excess emission compared to a homogeneously expanding fireball model, likely due to SN ejecta interacting with a companion or immediate circumstellar matter. The optical spectra of SN 2021hpr are overall similar to those of normal SNe Ia, but characterized by prominent detached high-velocity features (HVFs) of Si {\sc ii} and Ca {\sc ii} in the early phase. After examining a small sample of well-observed normal SNe Ia, we find that the HVFs are likely common for the subgroup with early-excess emission. The association of early bump feature with the HVFs could be attributed to density or abundance enhancement at the outer layer of the exploding star, likely as a result of interactions with companion$/$CSM or experiencing more complete burning. Nevertheless, the redshifted Fe {\sc ii} and Ni {\sc ii} lines in the nebular-phase spectra of SN 2021hpr, contrary to the blueshift trend seen in other SNe Ia showing early bump features, indicate its peculiarity in the explosion that remains to be understood.</p>

<p>Observations of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) are crucial to understanding supernova explosion mechanisms and their impact on our Galaxyâs evolution. SNRs are usually identified by searching for extended, circular structures in all-sky surveys. However, the resolution and sensitivity of any given survey results in selection biases related to the brightness and angular scale of a subset of the total SNR population. As a result, we have only identified 1/3 of the expected number of SNRs in our Galaxy. We used data collected by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) to perform a visual search for SNR candidates over 285deg &lt; l &lt; 70deg and |b| &lt; 16deg. We then used the Widefield Infrared Survey Explorer to eliminate likely HII regions from our SNR candidate sample. By exploiting the resolution and sensitivity of MWA data, we have successfully detected 10 new candidates using our proposed method. In addition, our method has also enabled us to detect and verify 10 previously known but unconfirmed candidates. The 20 SNR candidates described in the paper will increase the known SNR population in the Galaxy by 7{\%}.</p>
