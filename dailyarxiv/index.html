<p>2024-12-09, <strong>Dark Matter Freeze-In during Warm Inflation and the Seesaw Mechanism</strong>, Rayff de Souza et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06778v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.06778v1</a></p>

<p>A compelling way to address the inflationary period is via the warm inflation scenario, where the interaction of the inflaton field with other degrees of freedom affects its dynamics in such a way that slow-roll inflation is maintained by dissipative effects in a thermal bath. In this context, if a dark matter particle is coupled to the bath due to non-renormalizable interactions, the observed dark matter abundance may be produced during warm inflation via ultra-violet freeze-in. In this work, we propose applying this scenario in the framework of a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge extension of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, where we also employ the seesaw mechanism for generating neutrino masses.</p>

<p>2024-12-09, <strong>Determining Absolute Neutrino Mass using Quantum Technologies</strong>, A. A. S. Amad et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06338v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.06338v1</a></p>

<p>Next generation tritium decay experiments to determine the absolute neutrino mass require high-precision measurements of $\beta$-decay electron energies close to the kinematic end point. To achieve this, the development of high phase-space density sources of atomic tritium is required, along with the implementation of methods to control the motion of these atoms to allow extended observation times. A promising approach to efficiently and accurately measure the kinetic energies of individual $\beta$-decay electrons generated in these dilute atomic gases, is to determine the frequency of the cyclotron radiation they emit in a precisely characterised magnetic field. This cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy (CRES) technique can benefit from recent developments in quantum technologies. Absolute static-field magnetometry and electrometry, which is essential for the precise determination of the electron kinetic energies from the frequency of their emitted cyclotron radiation, can be performed using atoms in superpositions of circular Rydberg states. Quantum-limited microwave amplifiers will allow precise cyclotron frequency measurements to be made with maximal signal-to-noise ratios and minimal observation times. Exploiting the opportunities offered by quantum technologies in these key areas, represents the core activity of the Quantum Technologies for Neutrino Mass (QTNM) project. Its goal is to develop a new experimental apparatus that can enable a determination of the absolute neutrino mass with a sensitivity on the order of 10~meV/$c^2$.</p>

<p>2024-12-09, <strong>Ultralight axion or axion-like particle dark matter and 21-cm absorption signals in new physics</strong>, C. R. Das et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06213v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.06213v1</a></p>

<p>A hypothetical particle known as the axion holds the potential to resolve both the cosmic dark matter riddle and particle physics’ long-standing, strong CP dilemma. An unusually strong 21-cm absorption feature associated with the initial star formation era, i.e., the dark ages, may be due to ultralight axion dark matter ($\sim 10^{-22}$ eV) at this time. The radio wave observation’s 21-cm absorption signal can be explained as either anomalous baryon cooling or anomalous cosmic microwave background photon heating. Shortly after the axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) thermalize among themselves and form a Bose-Einstein condensate, the cold dark matter ALPs make thermal contact with baryons, cooling them. ALPs are thought to be the source of some new evidence for dark matter, as the baryon temperature at cosmic dawn was lower than predicted based on presumptions. The detection of baryon acoustic oscillations is found to be consistent with baryon cooling by dark matter ALPs. Simultaneously, under the influence of the primordial black hole and/or intergalactic magnetic fields, the dark radiation composed of ALPs can resonantly transform into photons, significantly heating up the radiation in the frequency range relevant to the 21-cm tests. When examining the 21-cm cosmology at redshifts $z$ between 200 and 20, we see that, when taking into account both heating and cooling options at the same time, heating eliminated the theoretical excess number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, from the cooling effect.</p>

<p>2024-12-09, <strong>Can decaying vacuum solve the H_0 Tension?</strong>, L. S. Brito et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06756v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.06756v2</a></p>

<p>In the present work we analyze two different models of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, also known as vacuum decay models or $\Lambda(t)$CDM models. In both models, when the $H_0$ parameter is constrained by the Planck distance priors, its value is compatible with a higher value of $H_0$, in agreement with SH0ES data, while simultaneously reducing the values of $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_b$. In both models, we find $H_0=73.1\pm0.86$ at 68\% c.l. by combining Planck+SH0ES data. We also find the decay parameter to be $\varepsilon=0.0197^{+0.0032}_{-0.0027}$ for one model and $\varepsilon=0.0203\pm0.0034$ for the other one. From these analyses, a noninteracting model is excluded at least at $6\sigma$ c.l.! This shows that these types of models are promising in solving or at least alleviating the $H_0$ tension problem. Our analysis also shows a preference for the decay of vacuum into dark matter, in agreement to thermodynamic analyses.</p>

<p>2024-12-09, <strong>$f$-mode oscillations of dark matter admixed quarkyonic neutron star</strong>, D. Dey et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06739v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.06739v1</a></p>

<p>We systematically investigate $f-$mode oscillations ($\ell$ = 2) in quarkyonic neutron stars with dark matter, employing the Cowling approximation within the framework of linearized general relativity. The relativistic mean-field approach is used to compute various macroscopic properties of neutron stars. The analysis focuses on three key free parameters in the model: transition density, QCD confinement scale, and dark matter (DM) Fermi momentum, all of which significantly affect the properties of $f-$mode oscillations. The inclusion of dark matter in quarkyonic equations of state leads to notable variations in $f-$mode frequencies. Despite these changes, several universal relations among the oscillation properties are found to hold, demonstrating their robustness in the presence of dark matter.</p>

<p>2024-12-09, <strong>A note on the gravitational dark matter production</strong>, Jaume de Haro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06626v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.06626v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter, one of the fundamental components of the universe, has remained mysterious in modern cosmology and particle physics, and hence, this field is of utmost importance at present moment. One of the foundational questions is the origin of dark matter which directly links with its creation. In the present article we study the gravitational production of dark matter in two distinct contexts: firstly, when reheating occurs through the gravitational particle production, and secondly, when it is driven by the inflaton’s decay. We establish a connection between the reheating temperature and the mass of dark matter, and from the reheating bounds, we determine the range of viable dark matter mass values.</p>

<p>2024-12-09, <strong>Constraints of Cosmic Expansion Using an MSF</strong>, Goratamang Gaedie et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06523v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.06523v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we propose a modified scale factor (MSF) that allows us to explore the accelerating expansion of the universe without invoking the traditional dark-energy model, as described in the Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. Instead, the MSF model introduces parameters that encapsulate the effects traditionally attributed to dark energy. To test the viability of this MSF, we constrained the model using the observational Hubble parameter (OHD), distance modulus measurements (SNIa), and their combined datasets (OHD + SNIa). We implement a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulation to find the best-fit values of the model parameters. The MSF model produced best-fit values for the parameter $p$ associated with the power law of the matter-dominated era and $\beta$, the exponential parameter for the darkenergy-dominated era. For our MSF, these values are $p$ = 0.28 and $\beta$ = 0.52 when using SNIa data, $p$ = 0.63 and $\beta$ = 0.30 for OHD data and $p$ = 0.45 and $\beta$ = 0.53 for a combination of datasets (OHD + SNIa). The numerical results and plots of the deceleration parameter, fractional energy density, Hubble parameter, and luminosity distance are presented which are the key parameters for studying the accelerated expansion of the universe. We compare the results of our model with that of the $\Lambda$CDM model and reconcile them with astronomical observational data. Our results indicate that the MSF model shows promise, demonstrating good compatibility with current astronomical observations and performing comparably to the $\Lambda$CDM model across various datasets, particularly in predicting the accelerating expansion of the universe, while providing a unified framework that incorporates the simultaneous influence of matter and dark energy components.</p>

<p>2024-12-09, <strong>Revise the Dark Matter-Phantom Scalar Field Interaction</strong>, Andronikos Paliathanasis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06501v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.06501v2</a></p>

<p>The cosmological history and evolution are examined for gravitational models with interaction in the dark sector of the universe. In particular, we consider the dark energy to be described by a phantom scalar field and the dark matter $\rho _{m}$ as a pressureless ideal gas. We introduce the interacting function $Q=\beta \left( t\right) \rho_{m}$, where the function $% \beta \left( t\right) $ is considered to be proportional to $\dot{\phi}, \dot{\phi}^{2}H^{-1},~H$, or a constant parameter with dimensions of $\left[H_{0}\right] $. For the four interacting models, we study in details the phase space by calculating the stationary points. The latter are applied to reconstruct the cosmological evolution. Compactified variables are essential to understand the complete picture of the phase space and to conclude about the cosmological viability of these interacting models. The detailed analysis is performed for the exponential potential $V\left( \phi \right) =V_{0}e^{\lambda \phi }$. The effects of other scalar field potential functions on the cosmological dynamics are examined.</p>

<p>2024-12-09, <strong>Feedback from intermediate mass black holes on dwarf galaxy morphology at z=2</strong>, Da Bi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06495v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.06495v2</a></p>

<p>This study investigates the influence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) on galactic morphology, focusing on their evolution within dwarf galaxies at high redshift (z~2). Using high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations, we explore how IMBH properties, including seed masses, formation times, and feedback mechanisms, shape the morphology and properties of central dwarf galaxies. The simulations analyze galaxies in both high- and low-spin dark matter halos, under varying conditions of AGN feedback and black hole seeding methods, to assess their effects on gas fractions, star formation, and structural characteristics.   Results indicate that AGN feedback, particularly wind strength, significantly impacts galactic properties. Strong feedback results in lower stellar masses, flatter morphologies, and intermediate rotational support, along with prominent central structures and low Sersic indices (n &lt; 2). These findings challenge the applicability of low-redshift diagnostics like Gini-M20 at high redshift. Synthetic JWST observations reveal that pixelation effects may overestimate galaxy sizes, highlighting the complexity of linking IMBH evolution with dwarf galaxy formation and morphology. This study provides new insights into the typical environments of IMBHs in dwarf galaxies and their role in shaping early galactic structures.</p>

<p>2024-12-09, <strong>Dark-matter induced neutron-antineutron oscillations</strong>, Théo Brugeat et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06434v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.06434v1</a></p>

<p>If dark matter carries a baryon number of two, neutron-antineutron oscillations could require its presence to manifest themselves. If it is in addition very light, in the micro-eV range or up to a few orders of magnitude below, these oscillations could even exhibit a Rabi resonance. Though the magnetic tuning required to convert a macroscopic number of neutrons into antineutrons is not realistic, sizeable enhancements remain possible. Building on this observation, axionic realizations for this scenario are systematically analyzed. For true QCD axion models, we find that the Goldstone boson nature of the axion imposes the presence of axionless n-nbar mixing effects, either in vacuum or in decays, which are sufficiently constrained experimentally to leave no room for axion-induced oscillations. Thus, a generic scalar or axion-like dark matter background would have to exist to induce resonant n-nbar oscillations. Yet, if Nature has taken that path to relate dark matter and baryon number violation, the experimental signature would be striking and certainly worth pursuing.</p>

<p>2024-12-09, <strong>Prompt searches for feebly interacting particles at the LHC</strong>, Joscha Knolle for the ATLAS et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06297v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.06297v1</a></p>

<p>Recent results from the ATLAS and CMS experiments in searches for prompt signatures of feebly interacting particles are presented. All presented results are based on the 2015-2018 data set of $13\,\mathrm{TeV}$ proton-proton collisions, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about $140\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The discussed models include dark mesons, heavy neutral leptons, dark matter, and dark photons. The obtained exclusion limits significantly extend the probed parameter space and, in some cases, provide the first collider-based constraints for the considered models.</p>

<p>2024-12-09, <strong>Demystifying shock breakout spectra</strong>, Christopher M. Irwin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06734v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.06734v1</a></p>

<p>The spectrum of the first supernova light (i.e., the shock breakout and early cooling emission) is an important diagnostic for the state of the progenitor star just before explosion. We consider a streamlined model describing the emergent shock breakout spectrum, which enables a straightforward classification of the possible observed spectra during the early planar phase. The overall spectral evolution is determined by a competition between three important time-scales: the diffusion time $t_{\rm{bo}}$ of the shell producing the breakout emission, the light-crossing time of this shell $t_{\rm{lc}}$, and the time $t_{\rm{eq}}$ at which the observer starts to see layers of the ejecta where the gas and radiation are in thermal equilibrium. There are five allowed orderings of these time-scales, resulting in five possible scenarios with distinct spectral behaviours. Within each scenario, the spectrum at a given time is one of five possible types, which are approximately described by broken power-laws; we provide the spectral and temporal indices of each power-law segment, and the time evolution of the break frequencies. If high-cadence multi-wavelength observations can determine the relevant breakout scenario in future events, strong constraints can be placed on the physical conditions at the site of shock breakout.</p>

<p>2024-12-09, <strong>An unexplored regime of shock breakout with a distinct spectral signature</strong>, Christopher M. Irwin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06733v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.06733v1</a></p>

<p>The first light that escapes from a supernova explosion is the shock breakout emission, which produces a bright flash of UV or X-ray radiation. Standard theory predicts that the shock breakout spectrum will be a blackbody if the gas and radiation are in thermal equilibrium, or a Comptonized free-free spectrum if not. Using recent results for the post-breakout evolution which suggest that lower-temperature ejecta are probed earlier than previously thought, we show that another scenario is possible in which the gas and radiation are initially out of equilibrium, but the time when thermalized ejecta are revealed is short compared to the light-crossing time of the system. In this case, the observed spectrum differs significantly from the standard expectation, as the non-negligible light travel time acts to smear the spectrum into a complex multi-temperature blend of blackbody and free-free components. For typical parameters, a bright multi-wavelength transient is produced, with the free-free emission being spread over a wide frequency range from optical to hard X-rays, and the blackbody component peaking in soft X-rays. We explore the necessary conditions to obtain this type of unusual spectrum, finding that it may be relevant for bare blue supergiant progenitors, or for shocks with a velocity of $v_{\rm bo} \sim 0.1c$ breaking out from an extended medium of radius $R_{\rm env}$ with a sufficiently high density $\rho_{\rm bo} \gtrsim 4\times 10^{-12}\text{ g cm}^{-3} (R_{\rm env}/10^{14} \text{cm})^{-15/16}$. An application to low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts is considered in a companion paper.</p>

<p>2024-12-09, <strong>StarWhisper Telescope: Agent-Based Observation Assistant System to Approach AI Astrophysicist</strong>, Cunshi Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06412v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.06412v1</a></p>

<p>With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have introduced convenient and user-friendly methods for leveraging tools across various domains. In the field of astronomical observation, the construction of new telescopes has significantly increased astronomers’ workload. Deploying LLM-powered agents can effectively alleviate this burden and reduce the costs associated with training personnel. Within the Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey (NGSS) project, which encompasses eight telescopes across three observation sites, aiming to find the transients from the galaxies in 50 mpc, we have developed the \textbf{StarWhisper Telescope System} to manage the entire observation process. This system automates tasks such as generating observation lists, conducting observations, analyzing data, and providing feedback to the observer. Observation lists are customized for different sites and strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage of celestial objects. After manual verification, these lists are uploaded to the telescopes via the agents in the system, which initiates observations upon neutral language. The observed images are analyzed in real-time, and the transients are promptly communicated to the observer. The agent modifies them into a real-time follow-up observation proposal and send to the Xinglong observatory group chat, then add them to the next-day observation lists. Additionally, the integration of AI agents within the system provides online accessibility, saving astronomers’ time and encouraging greater participation from amateur astronomers in the NGSS project.</p>
