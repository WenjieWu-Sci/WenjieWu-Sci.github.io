<p>2025-10-16, <strong>Invisible neutron decay and light BSM particles</strong>, J. C. Helo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14940v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.14940v1</a></p>

<p>In Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) invisible neutron   decay arises from $d=12$ operators. Adding new, light particles to   the field content of the SM, such as right-handed neutrinos, allows   to construct operators for invisible neutron decay at much lower   dimensions. Observing invisible neutron decay, if nucleon decays   with charged leptons remain absent, would therefore point towards the   existence of new neutral degrees of freedom. Here, we discuss four   cases: (i) Adding right-handed neutrinos to the SM; (ii) a   right-handed neutrino and an axion-like particle; (iii) a   right-handed neutrino and a (nearly) massless singlet scalar; and   (iv) a right-handed neutrino and a light $Z’$. We give the general   tree-level decomposition for the resulting $d=(7-9)$ operators for   invisible neutron decay. We also briefly discuss LHC searches   related to the exotic states found in these UV completions.</p>

<p>2025-10-16, <strong>General-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers: The influence of spin on the multi-messenger picture</strong>, Anna Neuweiler et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14850v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.14850v1</a></p>

<p>The rich phenomenology of binary neutron star mergers offers a unique opportunity to test general relativity, investigate matter at supranuclear densities, and learn more about the origin of heavy elements. As multi-messenger sources, they emit both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation across several frequency bands. The interpretation of these signals relies heavily on accurate numerical-relativity simulations that incorporate the relevant microphysical processes. Using the latest updates of the BAM code, we perform general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star mergers with two different spin configurations. We adopt a state-of-the-art equation of state based on relativistic mean-field theory developed for dense matter in neutron star mergers. To capture both dynamical ejecta and secular outflows from magnetic and neutrino-driven winds, we evolve the systems up to $\sim 100\ \rm ms$ after the merger at considerably high resolution with a grid spacing of $\Delta x \approx 93\ \rm m$ across the neutron stars. Our results show that the non-spinning configuration undergoes a more violent merger, producing more ejecta with lower electron fraction and higher velocities, while the spinning configuration forms a larger disk due to its higher angular momentum. Although the initial magnetic field amplification within $\lesssim 10\ \rm ms$ after merger is similar in both systems, the non-spinning system reaches stronger magnetic fields and higher energies at later times. For a detailed view of the multi-messenger observables, we extract the gravitational-wave signal and compute nucleosynthesis yields, the expected kilonova and afterglow light curves from our ejecta profiles.</p>

<p>2025-10-16, <strong>Performance of the Prototype Station of the IceCube Surface Array Enhancement</strong>, S. Shefali for the IceCube Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14636v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.14636v1</a></p>

<p>The prototype station of the Surface Array Enhancement at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has been taking data in its final design since 2023. This station is part of the planned extension within the footprint of the existing surface array, IceTop. One station consists of 8 scintillator detectors, 3 radio antennas, and a central DAQ. The final upgrade of the scintillation detectors and their firmware at the prototype station has extended the dynamic range and increased the data-taking up-time, thereby expanding the observation window for air showers. This contribution will discuss the performance of the upgraded prototype station after commissioning and its angular resolution capabilities when observing air showers with the scintillation detectors and in coincidence with IceTop. Furthermore, the integration of additional stations during the most recent deployment will be discussed.</p>

<p>2025-10-15, <strong>Axisymmetric hydrodynamics in numerical relativity: treating coordinate singularity, artificial heating and modeling MHD instabilities</strong>, Pavan Chawhan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14127v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.14127v1</a></p>

<p>Two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnant are a cheap alternative to 3D simulations. To maintain realism for secular timescales, simulations must avoid accumulated errors from drifts in conserved quantities and artificial heating, and they must model turbulent transport in a way that remains plausible throughout the evolution. It is also crucial to avoid numerical artifacts due to the polar coordinate axis singularity. Methods that behave well near the axis often break flux-conservative form of the hydrodynamic equations, resulting in significant drifts in conserved quantities. We present a flux-conservative scheme that maintains smoothness near the axis without sacrificing conservative formulation of the equations or incurring drifts in conserved global quantities. We compare the numerical performance of different treatments of the hydrodynamic equations when evolving a hypermassive neutron star resembling the remnant of a BNS merger. These simulations demonstrate that the new scheme combines the axis smoothness of non-conservative methods with the mass and angular momentum conservation of other conservative methods on $\sim$ $10^2$ ms timescales of viscous and neutrino-driven evolution. Because fluid profiles remain smooth in the remnant interior, it is possible to remove artificial heating by evolving the entropy density. We show how physical heating and cooling terms can be easily calculated from source terms of the conservative evolution variables and demonstrate our implementation. Finally, we discuss and implement improvements to the effective viscosity scheme to better model the effect of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities as the remnant evolves.</p>

<p>2025-10-15, <strong>The Good Qualities of the Weak Axion</strong>, Giacomo Cacciapaglia et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14104v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.14104v1</a></p>

<p>The presence of a topological susceptibility in the electroweak sector of the Standard Model motivates the existence of a good quality weak axion $a_W$, associated with the spontaneous breaking of $B!+!L$. Its anomalous couplings and tiny mass, generated from electroweak instantons, render $a_W$ photophobic. We find that the strongest bound on the associated decay constant, $f_W$, stems from a loop-induced coupling to electrons, leading to $f_W \gtrsim 1000$ TeV from stellar cooling. Spontaneous breaking of the abelian ${B!+!L}$ symmetry induces proton decay via higher dimensional operators controlled by a new physics scale, $\Lambda$. Existing Super-Kamiokande limits on these decay channels constrain the new physics scale to be $\Lambda \gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV. The characteristic channel $p\to e^+ a_W$ and other possible operators mediating interactions with the Standard Model fields yield signals which are not detectable within the allowed parameter space. Future proton decay searches at the next-generation of neutrino experiments offer the most promising avenues to test the good qualities of the weak axion paradigm.</p>

<p>2025-10-15, <strong>Prospects for Exploring Non-Standard Neutrino Properties with Argon-Based CEvNS Experiments</strong>, Sam Carey et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14015v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.14015v1</a></p>

<p>Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) provides a powerful framework for testing the Standard Model (SM) and searching for new physics at low energies. In this work, we examine the prospects for argon-based CEvNS experiments at stopped-pion sources to perform precision measurements of weak interactions and probe non-standard neutrino properties. Our study focused on the CENNS-10 and CENNS-750 detectors at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Coherent Captain Mills (CCM) detector at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the proposed PIP2-BD detector at Fermilabs Facility for Dark Matter Discovery (F2D2). Using realistic neutrino fluxes and detector configurations corresponding to these facilities, we evaluate event rates and sensitivities to a range of observables. Within the SM, argon-based CEvNS detectors enable precision tests of electroweak parameters, including the weak mixing angle, at momentum transfers well below the electroweak scale. We also investigate the sensitivity of these experiments to neutrino electromagnetic properties, such as the magnetic moment and effective charge radius, as well as to possible non-standard neutrino interactions with quarks. Together, these studies highlight the potential of argon-based CEvNS experiments as a clean and versatile platform for precision exploration of non-standard neutrino properties.</p>

<p>2025-10-15, <strong>MHDuet : a high-order General Relativistic Radiation MHD code for CPU and GPU architectures</strong>, Carlos Palenzuela et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13965v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.13965v1</a></p>

<p>We present MHDuet, an open source evolution code for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with neutrino transport. The code solves the full set of Einstein equations coupled to a relativistic, magnetized fluid with an M1 neutrino radiation scheme using advanced techniques, including adaptive mesh and large eddy simulation techniques, to achieve high accuracy. The Simflowny platform generates the code from a high-level specification of the computational system, producing code that runs with either the SAMRAI or AMReX infrastructure. The choice of AMReX enables compilation and execution on GPUs, running an order of magnitude faster than on CPUs at the node level. We validate the code against benchmark tests, reproducing previous results obtained with the SAMRAI infrastructure, and demonstrate its capabilities with simulations of neutron stars employing realistic tabulated equations of state. Resolution studies clearly demonstrate convergence faster than second order in the grid spacing. Scaling tests reveal excellent strong and weak scaling performance when running on GPUs. The goal of the code is to provide a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of compact objects within multi-messenger astrophysics.</p>

<p>2025-10-15, <strong>Large Neutrino “Collider”</strong>, Yang Bai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13948v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.13948v1</a></p>

<p>We propose using current and future large-volume neutrino telescopes as ``Large Neutrino Colliders” (L$\nu$Cs) to explore TeV-scale physics beyond the Standard Model. Cosmic neutrinos with energies above 100 PeV colliding with nucleons in the detector reach center-of-mass energies beyond the 14 TeV limit of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Using recently predicted and measured high-energy and ultra-high-energy neutrino fluxes from IceCube and KM3NeT, we estimate mass-scale sensitivities for representative new physics scenarios at 1–30 km$^3$ L$\nu$Cs. Our results demonstrate that L$\nu$Cs provide a novel avenue to probe multi-TeV particles with sensitivities comparable to, or even surpassing, those of the LHC.</p>

<p>2025-10-15, <strong>Unified Origin of Dirac Neutrino and Asymmetric Dark Matter Masses via a Dirac-Type Leptogenesis</strong>, Megumi Ishida et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13723v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.13723v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a simple and unified framework that simultaneously explains the origins of light Dirac neutrino masses, asymmetric dark matter (ADM), and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. The model is based on an extended $U(1)_X$ Froggatt-Nielsen–like mechanism, which naturally generates suppressed Yukawa couplings and realizes a Dirac seesaw for neutrino masses. An additional $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry stabilizes the dark sector, where chiral fermions charged under $\mathbb{Z}_4$ serve as ADM candidates. Leptogenesis occurs through the out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy Dirac neutrinos, where the generated asymmetry is shared between the visible and dark sectors due to exact lepton-number conservation. The same suppression mechanism that explains the smallness of neutrino masses also determines the GeV-scale ADM mass. Numerical studies demonstrate that a fully asymmetric DM scenario is realized, consistent with relic abundance, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and direct detection constraints. This framework provides an experimentally testable connection between neutrino physics, dark matter, and baryogenesis within an anomaly-free setup.</p>

<p>2025-10-15, <strong>Hyperons and $Δ$’s in rotating protoneutron stars: Local properties</strong>, Franciele M. da Silva et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13574v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.13574v1</a></p>

<p>The structural evolution of rotating protoneutron stars encodes essential information about their observable signatures, while microscopic properties provide complementary knowledge to advance observational investigations. Using a relativistic mean-field model with density-dependent couplings that account for temperature and particle composition, we investigate rotation, neutrino-emission-driven changes in angular momentum, particle distributions, temperature profiles, and sound speed to probe the internal dynamics of protoneutron star matter. Additionally, we track the evolution of macroscopic quantities such as energy distribution and gravitational mass and establish direct links between microphysics and global evolution. Extending the framework of Phys. Rev. D 112, 023007 (2025), which focuses on the global properties of rotating protoneutron star evolution, our results reveal that protoneutron star deformation and thermal evolution are governed by angular momentum, mass, and composition. Exotic matter (hyperons and $\Delta$-resonances) and rapid rotation enhance deformation leading to a reduction in core temperature, whereas slowly rotating stars like PSR J0740$+$6620 remain nearly spherical. Our predicted equatorial radii for PSR J0740$+$6620, $13.0\ \mathrm{km} &lt; R_e &lt; 13.5\ \mathrm{km}$, are consistent with NICER measurements. These findings constrain the EoS, requiring a self-consistent treatment of rotation, mass-dependent compression, and composition-driven modeling to accurately model protoneutron star evolution in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics.</p>

<p>2025-10-15, <strong>Evidence for Neutrino Emission from X-ray Bright Active Galactic Nuclei with IceCube</strong>, R. Abbasi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13403v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.13403v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, IceCube reported neutrino emission from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. Using 13.1 years of IceCube data, we present a follow-up search for neutrino sources in the northern sky. NGC 1068 remains the most significant neutrino source among 110 preselected gamma-ray emitters while also being spatially compatible with the most significant location in the northern sky. Its energy spectrum is characterized by an unbroken power-law with spectral index $\gamma = 3.4 \pm 0.2$. Consistent with previous results, the observed neutrino flux exceeds its gamma-ray counterpart by at least two orders of magnitude. Motivated by this disparity and the high X-ray luminosity of the source, we selected 47 X-ray bright Seyfert galaxies from the Swift/BAT spectroscopic survey that were not included in the list of gamma-ray emitters. When testing this collection for neutrino emission, we observe a 3.3$\sigma$ excess from an ensemble of 11 sources, with NGC 1068 excluded from the sample. Our results strengthen the evidence that X-ray bright cores of active galactic nuclei are neutrino emitters.</p>

<p>2025-10-15, <strong>Coscattering Dark Matter in Scotogenic Models</strong>, Ang Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13231v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.13231v1</a></p>

<p>The Scotogenic mechanism is an appealing pathway to naturally explain the common origin of dark matter and tiny neutrino mass. However, the conventional scotogenic dark matter usually suffers stringent constraints from the non-observation of lepton flavor violation and direct detection. To generate the non-zero neutrino masses, at least two generations of dark particles are required. For example, two real scalar singlets $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are involved in the scotogenic inverse model, which are odd under the $Z_2$ symmetry. In this paper, we consider the masses of dark scalars are nearly degenerate $m_{\phi_1}\lesssim m_{\phi_2}$, which opens new viable pathway for the generation of dark matter $\phi_1$, such as the coscattering process $\phi_1\text{SM}\to \phi_2 \text{SM}$ and coannihilation processes $\phi_1 \phi_2 \to \text{SM SM}$ via the Higgs portal or Yukawa portal interactions. We explore the parameter space to produce the correct relic density through coscattering, as well as the contrastive coannihilation channel. We then comprehensively study the constraints of dark matter from Higgs decay, direct detection, and indirect detection. For the heavier dark scalar, the three-body decay $\phi_2\to\phi_1 f\bar{f}$ not only alerts the predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background, but also leads to the observable displaced vertex signature at colliders.</p>

<p>The BUTTON-30 detector is a 30-tonne technology demonstrator designed to evaluate the potential of hybrid event detection, simultaneously exploiting both Cherenkov and scintillation light to detect particle produced in neutrino interactions. The detector is installed at a depth of 1.1 km in the Boulby Underground Laboratory allowing to test the performance of this new technology underground in a low background environment. This paper describes the design and construction of the experiment.</p>

<p>Protons and neutrons are the building blocks of matter, glued together in nuclei by strong interactions. They can be excited by pions, real and virtual photons, neutrinos and other probes. These excitations are referred to as light baryon resonances. A short, pedagogical overview of the field is presented including experimental progress, interpretation of light baryon resonances, and a focus on analysis methods to extract the resonance spectrum from data.</p>

<p>2025-10-16, <strong>Phantom Mirage from Axion Dark Energy</strong>, Rayne Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14957v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.14957v1</a></p>

<p>Supernova (SN) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measures have recently provided hints that the dark energy is not only dynamical but apparently evolves from normal to phantom dark energy between redshifts $0&lt;z&lt;1$. A normal axion dark energy component in the mass range just below the Hubble scale can mimic a phantom component by appearing as dark energy at $z=1$ and dark matter at $z=0$, raising the possibility of a phantom mirage. We show that there is a wide range of axion dark energy contributions that can resolve the SN-BAO tension as well as thawing quintessence does, leaving BAO tension with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) for the distance measures from $z\sim 1$ to recombination to be resolved at high redshifts. With axions, raising the optical depth to reionization to $\tau \approx 0.1$ works essentially as well as $w_0-w_a$ phantom dark energy for all but the lowE CMB data, with a remaining $\Delta\chi^2\sim -16$ compared with $\Lambda$CDM, whereas a small spatial curvature of $\Omega_K \sim 0.003$ can largely relax the full SN-BAO-CMB tension with a total $\Delta\chi^2 \sim -12$.</p>

<p>Gravitational lensing is an invaluable probe of the nature of dark matter, and the structures it forms. Lensed gravitational waves in particular allow for unparalleled sensitivity to small scale structures within the lenses, due to the precise time resolution in combination with the continuous monitoring of the entire sky. In this work, we show two distinct ways of using strongly lensed gravitational waves to identify the presence of dark matter subhalos: \emph through higher order caustics generating high relative magnification ($\mu_r &gt; 2$), short time delay image pairs that break the caustic universality relations of single dark matter halos, which occur for $\sim 1-10$ percent of strongly lensed events in our cold dark matter models, and \emph{ii)} through the presence of more than three highly magnified images, which occur for $\sim 0.01-1$ percent of the same simulated events. We find that these results are highly sensitive to the concentrations of subhalos in our simulations, and more mildly to their number densities. The presence of low-mass subhalos increases the probability of observing wave-optics lensing in lensed gravitational waves, which is studied by solving the diffraction integral with the stationary phase approximation, as well as numerically. We also report distinct quantitative and qualitative differences in the distributions of relative magnifications and time delays for subhalo populations with increased number densities or concentrations. With the upcoming detection of strongly lensed events by ground- and space- based detectors, comparisons against these simulated distributions will provide insight into the nature of dark matter.</p>

<p>The 21-cm signal is a powerful probe of the early Universe’s thermal history and could provide a unique avenue for constraining exotic physics. Previous studies have forecasted stringent constraints on energy injections from exotic sources that heat, excite, and ionize the background gas and thereby modify the 21-cm signal. In this work, we quantify the substantial impact that astrophysical uncertainties have on the projected sensitivity to exotic energy injection. In particular, there are significant uncertainties in the minimum star-forming dark matter halo mass, the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, and the X-ray emission, whose values characterize the fiducial astrophysical model when projecting bounds. As a case study, we investigate the energy injection of accreting primordial black holes of mass $\sim 1~M_\odot-10^3~M_\odot$, also taking into account uncertainties in the accretion model. We show that, depending on the chosen fiducial model and accretion uncertainties, the sensitivity of future 21-cm data could constrain the abundance of primordial black holes to be either slightly stronger, or significantly weaker, than current limits from the Cosmic Microwave Background.</p>

<p>In this article, we investigate asymptotically flat non-exotic traversable wormhole geometries within the King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter halos in the framework of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity. Two functional forms of the theory are considered: Model-I: $f(R, L_m)=(R/2) + L_m^{\alpha}$ and Model-II: $f(R, L_m)=(R/2) + (1 + \lambda R)L_m$. For both models, wormhole solutions are obtained and analyzed using the King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter density profiles, allowing us to explore how the underlying matter distribution influences the wormhole structures. The energy conditions are examined to verify the feasibility of sustaining the wormhole geometries with non-exotic matter, while embedding surfaces, proper radial distance, and total gravitational energy are studied to illustrate the wormhole’s physical viability and traversability. Moreover, we test the strong deflection angle and its implications for gravitational lensing and show possible observational signatures of such wormhole configurations. Our results indicate that within $f(R, L_m)$ gravity, and for appropriate parameter choices, dark matter environments can sustain physically consistent non-exotic traversable wormhole geometries with distinct gravitational lensing signatures, providing new insights into the interplay between modified gravity, dark matter, and astrophysical observations.</p>

<p>JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy enables dynamical mass measurements for typical star-forming galaxies only a billion years after the Big Bang. We model the H$\alpha$ morpho-kinematics of 163 galaxies at redshift $z\approx4$-6 from FRESCO and CONGRESS (with JADES imaging), using the $\texttt{geko}$ code, and infer rotational velocities and dispersions within $r_{\rm e}$. Our sample spans $\log M_{\star}\approx7$-10 and $\log M_{\rm dyn}\approx9$-11. Gas masses are estimated via scaling relations, yielding baryonic masses and dark-matter (DM) fractions $f_{\rm DM}(r&lt;r_{\rm e})$ within the H$\alpha$ half-light radius. We find high median fractions of $\langle f_{\rm gas}\rangle=0.77$ and $\langle f_{\rm DM}\rangle=0.73$, where $f_{\rm gas}$ is measured with respect to the baryonic mass and $f_{\rm DM}$ with respect to the DM+baryonic mass. About two-thirds of systems are DM-dominated within $r_{\rm e}\sim0.5-1$ kpc. Both $f_{\rm gas}$ and $f_{\rm DM}$ decrease with stellar mass, consistent with simulations. The stellar Tully-Fisher relation shows a tentative offset to higher $v_{\rm circ}$ at fixed $M_{\star}$ and substantial intrinsic scatter, suggesting that the relation is only beginning to emerge at $z\sim5$. We measure a negative correlation between $f_{\rm DM}$ and baryonic surface density $\Sigma_{\rm bar}$, weaker but broadly consistent with trends at cosmic noon and at $z\sim0$. Qualitatively comparing with modified NFW profiles coupled to an empirical stellar-to-halo mass relation suggests that the lowest $f_{\rm DM}$ ($\lesssim0.4$) require cored inner DM profiles, while the highest fractions favour cuspier profiles, potentially reflecting adiabatic contraction. Overall, the elevated $f_{\rm gas}$ and $f_{\rm DM}$ at $z\gtrsim4$ are compatible with progenitors of baryon-dominated systems at $z\sim2$ and naturally anticipate overmassive black holes at fixed $M_{\star}$.</p>

<p>Strong gravitational lensing provides a powerful tool to directly infer the dark matter (DM) subhalo mass function (SHMF) in lens galaxies. However, comparing observationally inferred SHMFs to theoretical predictions remains challenging, as the predicted SHMF can vary significantly between galaxies - even within the same cosmological model - due to differences in the properties and environment of individual galaxies. We present a machine learning framework to infer the galaxy-specific predicted SHMF from galaxy images, conditioned on the assumed inverse warm DM particle mass $M^{-1}_{\rm DM}$. To train the model, we use 1024 high-resolution hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations from the DREAMS suite. Mock observations are generated using Synthesizer, excluding gas particle contributions, and SHMFs are computed with the Rockstar halo finder. Our neural network takes as input both the galaxy images and the inverse DM mass. This method enables scalable, image-based predictions for the theoretical DM SHMFs of individual galaxies, facilitating direct comparisons with observational measurements.</p>

<p>2025-10-15, <strong>No cosmological constraints on dark photon dark matter from resonant conversion: Impact of nonlinear plasma dynamics</strong>, Anson Hook et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13956v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.13956v1</a></p>

<p>We revisit and invalidate all dark photon dark matter constraints from resonant conversion of dark photons into photons (plasmons) in the early universe. These constraints rely on the resonant transfer of a substantial portion of the dark photon energy density into the SM plasma, heating the plasma in the process. We demonstrate that this resonant transfer saturates because of plasma nonlinearities. Dark photon dark matter resonantly converts into $k \simeq 0$ Langmuir waves in the early universe electron-ion plasma. Once the Langmuir-wave energy approaches the thermal energy of the plasma, nonlinear effects driven by the ponderomotive force become significant. In particular, we show using dedicated Particle-in-Cell simulations that large-amplitude $k = 0$ Langmuir waves excite higher-k Langmuir and ion acoustic waves, producing strong spatial variations in density and plasma frequency. These inhomogeneities suppress further resonant conversion, limiting the deposited energy to about the thermal energy of the electrons at the time of conversion, orders of magnitude below observable cosmological thresholds. Consequently, the dark photon dark matter constraints are weaker by factors of $3000$ to $10^7$ across ten orders of magnitude in dark photon mass.</p>

<p>Ultralight dark matter may couple quadratically to Standard Model particles. Such quadratic interactions give rise to both coherent and stochastic signals in pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. In this work, we characterize these signals, including the effects of dark matter propagation in a finite-density medium, and assess the sensitivity of current and upcoming PTA observations to their detection. For coherent signals, we find that the sensitivity of current PTA observations competes with and sometimes exceeds that of other probes, such as equivalence principle tests and atomic clocks. For stochastic signals, we find that PTA sensitivities underperform equivalence principle constraints for both existing and upcoming PTA data sets.</p>

<p>An analysis of baryogenesis and stochastic gravitational wave production is presented for an extension of the standard model where the dark sector consists of dark matter particles charged under a $U(1)_x$ gauge symmetry, while a subset of dark fields also carry lepton number but no $U(1)_x$ charge. We demonstrate that with CP violation induced by Yukawa couplings, equal and opposite lepton asymmetries are generated in the visible and hidden sectors. Subsequent evolution preserves lepton number separately in each sector, and sphaleron interactions partially convert the lepton asymmetry into baryon asymmetry near the temperature of the first-order phase transition. Further, we discuss stochastic gravitational wave background production for the first-order phase transition using a gauge-independent bubble nucleation dynamics which yields spectra also valid in the supercooled low-temperature regime with {$T_p/m_{A_x} \ll 1$} where $T_p$ is the percolation temperature and $m_{A_x}$ is the dark photon mass. A parameter-space scan identifies regions that simultaneously account for cogenesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter and predict stochastic gravitational wave signals within reach of current (NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA) and future detectors at higher frequencies, providing a unified framework for cogenesis and associated gravitational wave production.</p>

<p>In extreme/intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (E/IMRIs) embedded in dark-matter (DM) spikes, the secondary black hole can accrete collisionless particles from the surrounding halo. We study how the companion’s spin controls this process, and the ensuing back-reaction on the magnitude and direction of the companion’s spin vector. We find that higher spin suppresses the mass accretion rate but enhances the accretion-induced torques, driving spin-down and secular alignment of the companion’s spin with the orbital plane. Collisionless DM accretion generically imprints a near-universal mass-spin correlation characterized by a spin-evolution parameter $s \simeq 2.8$, much larger than is the case for typical astrophysical environments, and largely independent of the local DM density and the spike slope. The associated spin-down proceeds on astrophysically relevant timescales, thus observations of rapidly spinning IMRI companions would disfavor the presence of dense DM environments, providing constraints complementary to those arising from dynamical friction.</p>

<p>The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), arising from the incoherent superposition of numerous compact binary coalescences, serves as a powerful probe of both astrophysical populations and fundamental physics. In this work, we investigate the influence of gravitational lensing on the SGWB, focusing on primordial black holes (PBHs) as potential lenses. Assuming PBHs as dark matter candidates with a broad cosmic distribution, we show that their lensing optical depth can be significantly enhanced, producing pronounced effects with relative deviations at the 10^-1 level. By systematically varying the PBH mass (M_PBH) and abundance (f_PBH), we demonstrate that the mass predominantly determines the frequency-dependent diffraction features of the spectrum, while the abundance primarily amplifies the overall lensing-induced deviation. Although the SGWB from binary black holes has not yet been observed, our analytical results provide theoretical insight into the possible imprint of lensing on its spectrum and suggest that future detections could offer a novel avenue to constrain dark matter scenarios.</p>

<p>2025-10-15, <strong>Examining a new form of non-standard dark matter using DESI DR2 data</strong>, Yan-Hong Yao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13436v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.13436v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we propose a non-standard dark matter (NSDM) model in which the equation of state (EoS) of dark matter (DM) is parameterized as $w_{\rm dm} = w_2 a^2$, and this DM model is motivated by the idea that DM must become cold dark matter (CDM) in the neighborhood of the scale factor $a = 0$, which implies that both the EoS of DM, $w_{\rm dm}$, and its derivative with respect to the scale factor, ${\rm d}w_{\rm dm}/{\rm d}a$, vanish at $a = 0$. By incorporating the latest cosmological datasets – including the Planck2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), together with three independent Type Ia Supernova datasets, namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus sample – we constrain the $\Lambda w_2$DM, $ww_2$DM, and $w_0w_aw_2$DM models, which are constructed by replacing CDM with NSDM in the $\Lambda $CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM models, respectively. We find that there is a preference for a negative DM EoS at more than the $3\sigma$ confidence level for the data combinations CMB+DESI+Union3 and CMB+DESI+DESY5. Moreover, for all data combinations, replacing CDM with NSDM in the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM models significantly reduces the probability of violating the null energy condition. Furthermore, both $ww_2$DM and $w_0w_aw_2$DM are favored over $\Lambda $CDM with a significance comparable to that of the $w_0w_a$CDM model.</p>

<p>Dark matter (DM) plays a crucial role in explaining the observed astrophysical anomalies, galaxy rotation curves, and other fundamental characteristics of the Universe. Many extensions of the Standard Model (SM), such as the dark hidden-sector model, provide an attractive framework in which DM can couple to SM particles via various portals. These portals give rise to several possible new particles beyond the SM, such as light Higgs bosons, dark photons, and axion-like particles. Furthermore, the origin of DM and the observed asymmetry between visible matter and antimatter may be connected through the introduction of a dark baryon. If the masses of these hypothetical particles lie in the few-GeV range, they can be explored at high-intensity $e^+e^-$ collider experiments, such as the BESIII experiment. This report presents a review of recent BESIII results related to searches for dark-sector particles.</p>

<p>Bars are among the most prominent structures in disk galaxies. While the widely accepted swing-amplification theory provides a qualitative framework for their formation, the detailed physical processes remain incompletely understood. Previous studies have shown that the bar formation timescale in isolated galaxies depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction (the so-called “Fujii relation”) and linearly on disk hotness and thickness. However, the influence of dark matter halo spin on bar formation has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we construct a suite of $N$-body models of disk and halo with varying disk mass fractions and amounts of random motions. By introducing prograde and retrograde spins in the dark matter halo, we explore how halo spin modifies the established empirical relations governing bar formation timescales. We find that these relations remain valid in both prograde and retrograde halo spin models. For rapid bar formation (short timescale), the effect of halo spin is nearly negligible. In contrast, for moderately slow bar formation, prograde (retrograde) halo spin tends to accelerate (suppress) bar onset. In cases of extremely slow bar formation, halo spin introduces a stronger but more stochastic influence. These trends might arise from the exchange of angular momentum between the stellar disk and the dark matter halo.</p>

<p>In these lecture notes, we describe the current state-of-the-art for numerical simulations of large-scale structure and galaxy formation. Numerical simulations play a central role in the preparation and the exploitation of large-scale galaxy surveys, in which galaxies are the fundamental observational objects. We first describe basic methods for collisionless N-body dynamics that enable us to model dark matter accurately by solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations. We then discuss simple methods to populate dark matter halos with galaxies, such as Halo and Sub-halo Abundance Matching techniques and baryonification techniques for capturing baryonic effects on the matter distribution. We finally describe how to model the gas component by solving the Euler-Poisson equations, focusing on the foundational assumptions behind these equations, namely local thermo-dynamical equilibrium, and the nature of the truncation errors of the numerical scheme, namely numerical diffusion. We show a few examples of simulations of a Milky-Way-like halo without cooling, with cooling and with star formation. We finally describe different subgrid prescriptions recently developed to model star formation, supernovae feedback and active galactic nuclei and how they impact cosmological simulations.</p>

<p>Supernova (SN) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measures have recently provided hints that the dark energy is not only dynamical but apparently evolves from normal to phantom dark energy between redshifts $0&lt;z&lt;1$. A normal axion dark energy component in the mass range just below the Hubble scale can mimic a phantom component by appearing as dark energy at $z=1$ and dark matter at $z=0$, raising the possibility of a phantom mirage. We show that there is a wide range of axion dark energy contributions that can resolve the SN-BAO tension as well as thawing quintessence does, leaving BAO tension with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) for the distance measures from $z\sim 1$ to recombination to be resolved at high redshifts. With axions, raising the optical depth to reionization to $\tau \approx 0.1$ works essentially as well as $w_0-w_a$ phantom dark energy for all but the lowE CMB data, with a remaining $\Delta\chi^2\sim -16$ compared with $\Lambda$CDM, whereas a small spatial curvature of $\Omega_K \sim 0.003$ can largely relax the full SN-BAO-CMB tension with a total $\Delta\chi^2 \sim -12$.</p>

<p>We analyze a model of quintessence governed by an exponential potential and non-minimally coupled to gravity, in light of recent datasets, including cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations, and supernovae distance moduli observations. Mainly focusing on the Palatini formulation of gravity, a phase space analysis reveals the existence of a late-time stable de Sitter attractor as long as the non-minimal coupling constant is negative, regardless of the value of the slope of the exponential. Fitting to CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we find strong evidence for our model over $\Lambda$CDM, with a Bayes factor $\log B = 5.52$. Furthermore, the data seem to prefer dynamical dark energy at $&gt;3\sigma$ C.L. and a phantom crossing in the barotropic parameter of dark energy at $2-3\sigma$ C.L.. We find that the scalar field dynamics in the Palatini formalism provides marginally better agreement to the data compared to the metric formalism.</p>

<p>For the first time, we show in MHD simulations with cosmological initial conditions that bi-lobed gamma-ray outflows similar to the Fermi bubbles can form from star formation and supernova feedback, without involvement from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We use simulations run with full MHD and dynamical, on-the-fly multi-species cosmic ray transport in MeV-TeV energy bins to model gamma-ray emission in Milky Way-mass spiral galaxies from neutral pion decay, relativistic non-thermal Bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton scattering. We find that these gamma-ray outflows are present in all three Milky-Way mass simulated galaxies. The amplitude, shape, and the composition of the gamma-ray spectrum of these bubbles fluctuates over time, with lepton-dominated and hadron-dominated phases. Spectra in which there is O(1) more gamma-ray flux from inverse Compton scattering than neutral pion decay are a good fit to the measured Fermi-LAT spectrum. Additionally, these simulations predict multi-wavelength features in soft x-rays and synchrotron radio, potentially providing new observational signatures that can connect the circumgalactic medium to cosmic ray physics and activity in the galactic center.</p>

<p>Recent observations have revealed a surprisingly large fraction of hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) interacting with dense confined circumstellar material (CSM), whose origin is heavily debated. Exploiting our recent implementation of a sophisticated radiation transport scheme in the moving-mesh code AREPO, we perform full-sphere 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of red supergiant envelopes. For $10\, M_\odot$ and $20\, M_\odot$ core-carbon-burning stars, we find that large-amplitude radial pulsations lift the surface material of density $10^{-14}$-$10^{-12}\; \mathrm{g\; cm^{-3}}$ to the circumstellar environment up to $3\times10^{14}$ cm, consistent with the inferred density for the interacting SN 2013fs. There, radiation acts on dust to drive highly anisotropic outflows of $10^{-6}$-$10^{-5}\, M_\odot\, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. The total CSM masses for both simulations are $\sim 0.01\, M_\odot$. Due to convection, the CSM density structure has order-of-magnitude angular variations, dominated by large-scale asymmetries. We suggest that (1) the CSM around the progenitor is bound material instead of a widely-assumed steady wind, (2) highly aspherical CSM is common and can be created by surface convection rather than only from binary interactions, and (3) 3D effects need to be incorporated in 1D SN modeling, potentially via effective clumping. Based on our simulations, we propose a 1D analytical CSM model to be directly used for SN observable modeling. We predict that progenitor pulsations (seen in SN 2023ixf) and highly-confined CSM (seen in SN 2013fs) should be common among most hydrogen-rich SNe. This can be tested with progenitor monitoring using Rubin Observatory and near-future high-cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT and UVEX.</p>

<p>We provide a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenology of axion-like particles (ALPs) produced in core-collapse supernovae (ccSNe) through interactions with electrons and muons, both of which have a non-negligible abundance in the SN plasma. We identify and calculate six significant ALP-production channels, two of which are loop-level processes involving photons. We then examine several observational constraints on the ALP-electron and ALP-muon parameter spaces. Those include the bounds on anomalous cooling, energy deposition, decay into photons, diffuse gamma rays, and the 511 keV line. Our results provide updated and robust constraints on ALP couplings to electrons and muons from an improved treatment of production and absorption processes. Furthermore, we quantify the uncertainties of the results by using three state-of-the-art supernova models based on two independent simulation codes, finding that constraints vary by factors of O(2-10).</p>

<p>Hubble constant tension, together with the recent indications of dynamical dark energy proposed from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, poses significant challenges to the standard cosmological model. In this work, we perform a model-independent reconstruction of the dark-energy equation of state $w(z)$, jointly with an evolving Hubble constant $H_0(z)$. Using the DESI DR2 data combined with multiple type Ia supernova samples, we find that $w(z)$ varies with redshift and exhibits two potential phantom crossings at $z\sim0.5$ and $z\sim1.5$. Meanwhile, $H_0$ decreases continually from local to high redshift, alleviating the Hubble constant tension effectively. The joint $w(z)$-$H_0(z)$ model is strongly favored over the $w$CDM ($\Lambda$CDM) framework, with a logarithmic Bayes factor $\ln \boldsymbol{\mathcal B}= 5.04~(8.53)$. Across various prior assumptions and dataset combinations, we obtain consistent, data-driven reconstructions of both $w(z)$ and $H_0(z)$. Future BAO measurements from Euclid and next-generation CMB experiments will provide critical tests of these results and bring deeper insights into the nature of dark energy and the evolution of cosmic expansion.</p>

<p>Time domain surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory are projected to annually discover millions of astronomical transients. This and complementary programs demand fast, automated methods to constrain the physical properties of the most interesting objects for spectroscopic follow up. Traditional approaches to likelihood-based inference are computationally expensive and ignore the multi-component energy sources powering astrophysical phenomena. In this work, we present a hierarchical simulation-based inference model for multi-band light curves that 1) identifies the energy sources powering an event of interest, 2) infers the physical properties of each subclass, and 3) separates physical anomalies in the learned embedding space. Our architecture consists of a transformer-based light curve summarizer coupled to a flow-matching regression module and a categorical classifier for the physical components. We train and test our model on $\sim$150k synthetic light curves generated with $\texttt{MOSFiT}$. Our network achieves a 90% classification accuracy at identifying energy sources, yields well-calibrated posteriors for all active components, and detects rare anomalies such as tidal disruption events (TDEs) through the learned latent space. This work demonstrates a scalable joint framework for population studies of known transients and the discovery of novel populations in the era of Rubin.</p>

<p>Photometric classification of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is critical for cosmological studies but remains difficult due to class imbalance and observational noise. While deep learning models have been explored, they are often resource-intensive and lack interpretability. We present a computationally efficient and interpretable classification framework that maintains high performance on imbalanced datasets. We emphasize the use of PR-AUC and F1-score as more informative metrics than ROC-AUC in severely imbalanced settings. Using an XGBoost ensemble optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, we classified light curves from the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge (SPCC), comprising 21,318 events with a 3.19 imbalance ratio (non-Ia to Ia). Our model achieved a PR-AUC of $0.993^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, an F1-score of $0.923 \pm 0.008$, and a ROC-AUC of $0.976 \pm 0.004$, matching or exceeding deep learning performance on precision-recall trade-offs while using fewer resources. Despite slightly lower overall accuracy, our method balances false positives and false negatives, improving the efficiency of spectroscopic follow-up. We show that optimized ensemble models offer a reproducible and lightweight alternative to complex architectures, particularly for large-scale surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) where transparency and efficiency are essential.</p>

<p>A long-lived central engine embedded in expanding supernova ejecta can alter the dynamics and observational signatures of the event, producing an unusually luminous, energetic, and/or rapidly-evolving transient. We use two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations to study the effect of a central energy source, varying the amount, rate, and isotropy of the energy deposition. We post-process the results with a time-dependent Monte Carlo radiation transport code to extract observational signatures. The engine excavates a bubble at the centre of the ejecta, which becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. Sufficiently powerful engines are able to break through the edge of the bubble and accelerate, shred, and compositionally mix the entire ejecta. The breakout of the engine-driven wind occurs at distinct rupture points, and the outflowing high-velocity gas may eventually give rise to radio emission. The dynamical impact of the engine leads to faster rising optical light curves, with photon escape facilitated by the faster expansion of the ejecta and the opening of low-density channels. For models with strong engines, the spectra are initially hot and featureless, but later evolve to resemble those of broad-line Ic supernovae. Under certain conditions, line emission from ionized, low-velocity material near the centre of the ejecta may be able to escape and produce narrow emission similar to that seen in interacting supernovae. We discuss how variability in the engine energy reservoir and injection rate could give rise to a heterogeneous set of events spanning multiple observational classes, including the fast blue optical transients, broad-line Ic supernovae, and superluminous supernovae.</p>

<p>2025-10-15, <strong>The Supernova 1987A system and its recent evolution - a review</strong>, Michael J. Barlow et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13629v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.13629v1</a></p>

<p>Supernova 1987A was the closest supernova event to be observed in nearly 400 years. The outflowing ejecta from the explosion continues to interact with extended circumstellar material and with the equatorial ring (ER) in the triple ring system, while observations of the system have continued across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. This review mainly focuses on works published over the past ten years on Supernova 1987A and its remnant. These include (a) submillimetre, infrared and X-ray studies of molecules, ions and dust in the ejecta, and (b) infrared, optical and X-ray studies of dust and ionized gas in the ER and in the surrounding circumstellar medium, including their time evolution as the ER is shocked and eroded by the impact of high velocity ejecta. Since 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope has become available for high angular resolution infrared observations of Supernova 1987A and has made significant contributions to both (a) and (b) above. Its discovery of redshifted narrow-line emission from multiple ion species located at the centre of the ejecta strongly requires the presence there of either a cooling hot neutron star, or a pulsar wind nebula, to power the emission.</p>

<p>2025-10-15, <strong>Examining a new form of non-standard dark matter using DESI DR2 data</strong>, Yan-Hong Yao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13436v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.13436v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we propose a non-standard dark matter (NSDM) model in which the equation of state (EoS) of dark matter (DM) is parameterized as $w_{\rm dm} = w_2 a^2$, and this DM model is motivated by the idea that DM must become cold dark matter (CDM) in the neighborhood of the scale factor $a = 0$, which implies that both the EoS of DM, $w_{\rm dm}$, and its derivative with respect to the scale factor, ${\rm d}w_{\rm dm}/{\rm d}a$, vanish at $a = 0$. By incorporating the latest cosmological datasets – including the Planck2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), together with three independent Type Ia Supernova datasets, namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus sample – we constrain the $\Lambda w_2$DM, $ww_2$DM, and $w_0w_aw_2$DM models, which are constructed by replacing CDM with NSDM in the $\Lambda $CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM models, respectively. We find that there is a preference for a negative DM EoS at more than the $3\sigma$ confidence level for the data combinations CMB+DESI+Union3 and CMB+DESI+DESY5. Moreover, for all data combinations, replacing CDM with NSDM in the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM models significantly reduces the probability of violating the null energy condition. Furthermore, both $ww_2$DM and $w_0w_aw_2$DM are favored over $\Lambda $CDM with a significance comparable to that of the $w_0w_a$CDM model.</p>

<p>2025-10-15, <strong>Some problems associated with the standardization of the light curve of type 1a supernovae</strong>, A. P. Mahtessian et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13187v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.13187v1</a></p>

<p>We show that the parameters used to standardize the luminosity of Type 1a supernovae in the SALT2 and SiFTO models are strongly dependent on the redshift z. Consequently, when standardized with increasing z, the average absolute magnitudes of Type 1a supernovae are artificially increased. This means that for a given apparent magnitude they are, on average, assigned larger distances than they actually are, creating the appearance of their recession with acceleration and requiring the introduction of the concept of antigravity (dark energy) to explain it. We also show that after standardization, Type 1a supernovae cease to be standard candles. We therefore argue that such a standardization is not suitable for measuring the distances to Type 1a supernovae, and hence the accelerating expansion of the Universe is called into question.</p>

<p>In these lecture notes, we describe the current state-of-the-art for numerical simulations of large-scale structure and galaxy formation. Numerical simulations play a central role in the preparation and the exploitation of large-scale galaxy surveys, in which galaxies are the fundamental observational objects. We first describe basic methods for collisionless N-body dynamics that enable us to model dark matter accurately by solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations. We then discuss simple methods to populate dark matter halos with galaxies, such as Halo and Sub-halo Abundance Matching techniques and baryonification techniques for capturing baryonic effects on the matter distribution. We finally describe how to model the gas component by solving the Euler-Poisson equations, focusing on the foundational assumptions behind these equations, namely local thermo-dynamical equilibrium, and the nature of the truncation errors of the numerical scheme, namely numerical diffusion. We show a few examples of simulations of a Milky-Way-like halo without cooling, with cooling and with star formation. We finally describe different subgrid prescriptions recently developed to model star formation, supernovae feedback and active galactic nuclei and how they impact cosmological simulations.</p>

<p>2025-10-15, <strong>Strong Progenitor Age-bias in Supernova Cosmology. II. Alignment with DESI BAO and Signs of a Non-Accelerating Universe</strong>, Junhyuk Son et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13121v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.13121v1</a></p>

<p>Supernova (SN) cosmology is based on the key assumption that the luminosity standardization process of Type Ia SNe remains invariant with progenitor age. However, direct and extensive age measurements of SN host galaxies reveal a significant (5.5{\sigma}) correlation between standardized SN magnitude and progenitor age, which is expected to introduce a serious systematic bias with redshift in SN cosmology. This systematic bias is largely uncorrected by the commonly used mass-step correction, as progenitor age and host galaxy mass evolve very differently with redshift. After correcting for this age-bias as a function of redshift, the SN dataset aligns more closely with the w0waCDM model recently suggested by the DESI BAO project from a combined analysis using only BAO and CMB data. This result is further supported by an evolution-free test that uses only SNe from young, coeval host galaxies across the full redshift range. When the three cosmological probes (SNe, BAO, CMB) are combined, we find a significantly stronger (&gt; 9{\sigma}) tension with the {\Lambda}CDM model than that reported in the DESI papers, suggesting a time-varying dark energy equation of state in a currently non-accelerating universe.</p>

<p>2025-10-15, <strong>Galactic chemical evolution with the short-lived isotopes Mn-53, Fe-60, Hf-182, and Pu-244</strong>, Benjamin Wehmeyer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13070v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.13070v1</a></p>

<p>We run a three-dimensional Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model to follow the propagation of Mn-53 from supernovae of type Ia (SNIa), Fe-60 from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), Hf-182 from intermediate mass stars (IMSs), and Pu-244 from neutron star mergers (NSMs) in the Galaxy. We compare the GCE of these short-lived radioactive isotopes (SLRs) to recent detections on the deep-sea floor. We find that although these SLRs originate from different sites, they often arrive conjointly on Earth.</p>
