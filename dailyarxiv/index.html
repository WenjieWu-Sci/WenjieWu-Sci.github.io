<p>2024-01-23, <strong>A non-unitary solar constraint for long-baseline neutrino experiments</strong>, Andres Lopez Moreno et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12829v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.12829v1</a></p>

<p>Long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments require external constraints on $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ and $\Delta m_{21}^2$ to make precision measurements of the leptonic mixing matrix. These constraints come from measurements of the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) mixing in solar neutrinos. Here we develop an MSW large mixing angle approximation in the presence of heavy neutral leptons which adds a single new parameter ($\alpha_{11}$) representing the magnitude of the mixing between the $\nu_e$ state and the heavy sector. We use data from the Borexino, SNO and KamLAND collaborations to find a solar constraint appropriate for heavy neutral lepton searches in long-baseline oscillation experiments. Solar data limits the magnitude of the non-unitary parameter to $(1-\alpha_{11}) &lt; 0.046$ at the $99\%$ credible interval and yields a strongly correlated constraint on the solar mass splitting and the magnitude of $\nu_e$ non-unitary mixing.</p>

<p>2024-01-23, <strong>Multi-wavelength spectral modelling of the candidate neutrino blazar PKS 0735+178</strong>, Athira M Bharathan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12680v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.12680v1</a></p>

<p>The BL Lac object PKS 0735+178 was in its historic $\gamma$-ray brightness state during December 2021. This period also coincides with the detection of a neutrino event IC211208A, which was localized close to the vicinity of PKS 0735+178. We carried out detailed $\gamma$-ray timing and spectral analysis of the source in three epochs (a) quiescent state ($E_{1}$), (b) moderate activity state ($E_{2}$) and (c) high activity state ($E_{3}$) coincident with the epoch of neutrino detection. During the epoch of neutrino detection ($E_{3}$), we found the largest variability amplitude of 95%. The $\gamma$-ray spectra corresponding to these three epochs are well fit by the power law model and the source is found to show spectral variations with a softer when brighter trend. In the epoch $E_{3}$, we found the shortest flux doubling/halving time of 5.75 hrs. Even though the spectral energy distribution in the moderate activity state and in the high activity state could be modeled by the one-zone leptonic emission model, the spectral energy distribution in the quiescent state required an additional component of radiation over and above the leptonic component. Here we show that a photo-meson process was needed to explain the excess $\gamma$-ray emission in the hundreds of GeV which could not be accounted for by the synchrotron self-Compton process.</p>

<p>2024-01-23, <strong>Scale Invariant Extension of the Standard Model: A Nightmare Scenario in Cosmology</strong>, Mayumi Aoki et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12442v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.12442v1</a></p>

<p>Inflationary observables of a classically scale invariant model, in which the origin of the Planck mass and the electroweak scale including the right-handed neutrino mass is chiral symmetry breaking in a QCD-like hidden sector, are studied. Despite a three-field inflation the initial-value-dependence is strongly suppressed thanks to a river-valley like potential. The model predicts the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of cosmological perturbations smaller than that of the $R^2$ inflation, i.e., $ 0.0044 \gsim r \gsim 0.0017$ for e-foldings between $50$ and $60$: The model will be consistent even with a null detection at LiteBird/CMB-S4. We find that the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{NL}$ is $O(10^{-2})$, the same size as that of single-field inflation. The dark matter particles are the lightest Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with chiral symmetry breaking, which are decay products of one of the inflatons and are heavier than $10^9$ GeV with a strongly suppressed coupling with the standard model, implying that the dark matter will be unobservable in direct as well as indirect measurements.</p>

<p>2024-01-23, <strong>A new binning method to choose a standard set of Quasars</strong>, Maria Giovanna Dainotti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12847v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.12847v1</a></p>

<p>Although the Lambda Cold Dark Matter model is the most accredited cosmological model, information at intermediate redshifts (z) between type Ia Supernovae (z = 2.26) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (z = 1100) is crucial to validate this model further. Here, we present a detailed and reliable methodology for binning the quasars (QSO) data that allows the identification of a golden sample of QSOs to be used as standard candles. This procedure has the advantage of being very general. Thus, it can be applied to any astrophysical sources at cosmological distances. This methodology allows us to avoid the circularity problem since it involves a flux-flux relation and includes the analysis of removing selection biases and the redshift evolution. With this method, we have discovered a sample of 1253 quasars up to z = 7.54 with reduced intrinsic dispersion of the relation between Ultraviolet and X-ray fluxes, with $\delta_{int} = 0.096\pm 0.003$ (56\% less than the original sample where $\delta_{int} =0.22$). Once the luminosities are corrected for selection biases and redshift evolution, this `goldâ sample allows us to determine the matter density parameter to be $\Omega_M=0.240 \pm 0.064$. This value is aligned with the results of the $\Lambda CDM$ model obtained with SNe Ia.</p>

<p>2024-01-23, <strong>Research on the knee region of cosmic ray by using a novel type of electron-neutron detector array</strong>, Bing-Bing Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12754v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.12754v1</a></p>

<p>By accurately measuring composition and energy spectrum of cosmic ray, the origin problem of so called âkeenâ region (energy &gt; 1 PeV) can be solved. However, up to the present, the results of the spectrum in the knee region obtained by several previous experiments have shown obvious differences, so they cannot give effective evidence for judging the theoretical models on the origin of the knee. Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has reported several major breakthroughs and important results in astro-particle physics field. Relying on its advantages of wide-sky survey, high altitude location and large area detector arrays, the research content of LHAASO experiment mainly includes ultra high-energy gamma-ray astronomy, measurement of cosmic ray spectra in the knee region, searching for dark matter and new phenomena of particle physics at higher energy. The electron and Thermal Neutron detector (EN-Detector) is a new scintillator detector which applies thermal neutron detection technology to measure cosmic ray extensive air shower (EAS). This technology is an extension of LHAASO. The EN-Detector Array (ENDA) can highly efficiently measure thermal neutrons generated by secondary hadrons so called âskeletonâ of EAS. In this paper, we perform the optimization of ENDA configuration, and obtain expectations on the ENDA results, including thermal neutron distribution, trigger efficiency and capability of cosmic ray composition separation. The obtained real data results are consistent with those by the Monte Carlo simulation.</p>

<p>2024-01-23, <strong>Development of the fully Geant4 compatible package for the simulation of Dark Matter in fixed target experiments</strong>, B. Banto Oberhauser et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12573v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.12573v1</a></p>

<p>The search for new comparably light (well below the electroweak scale) feebly interacting particles is an exciting possibility to explain some mysterious phenomena in physics, among them the origin of Dark Matter. The sensitivity study through detailed simulation of projected experiments is a key point in estimating their potential for discovery.   Several years ago we created the DMG4 package for the simulation of DM (Dark Matter) particles in fixed target experiments. The natural approach is to integrate this simulation into the same program that performs the full simulation of particles in the experiment setup. The Geant4 toolkit framework was chosen as the most popular and versatile solution nowadays.   The simulation of DM particles production by this package accommodates several possible scenarios, employing electron, muon or photon beams and involving various mediators, such as vector, axial vector, scalar, pseudoscalar, or spin 2 particles. The bremsstrahlung, annihilation or Primakoff processes can be simulated.   The package DMG4 contains a subpackage DarkMatter with cross section methods weakly connected to Geant4. It can be used in different frameworks.   In this paper, we present the latest developments of the package, such as extending the list of possible mediator particle types, refining formulas for the simulation and extending the mediator mass range. The user interface is also made more flexible and convenient.   In this work, we also demonstrate the usage of the package, the improvements in the simulation accuracy and some cross check validations.</p>

<p>2024-01-23, <strong>Radio Emission from SN 1181 Hosting a White Dwarf Merger Product</strong>, Takatoshi Ko et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12487v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.12487v1</a></p>

<p>The remnant of the historical supernova 1181 has recently been claimed to be associated with a white dwarf merger remnant J005311. The supernova remnant (SNR) shock, and a termination shock expected to be formed by the intense wind of J005311, are potential sites for radio emission via synchrotron emission from shock-accelerated electrons. In this paper, we estimate the radio emission from these two shocks, and find the peak radio flux to be 0.1â10 mJy (at 0.01â1 GHz) in the outer SNR shock and 0.01â0.1 mJy (at 1â10 GHz) in the inner termination shock. We also search for radio emission from this source in the archival data of the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey at 3 GHz, NRAO VLA Sky Survey at 1.4 GHz and the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey at 408 MHz, resulting in no significant detection. While targeted observations with higher sensitivity are desired, we particularly encourage those at higher frequency and angular resolution, such as the Jansky VLA in X-band (10 GHz), to probe the inner termination shock and its evolution.</p>

<p>2024-01-23, <strong>Impulsive Gas Fueling to Galactic Center in a Barred Galaxy Due to Falls of Gas Clouds</strong>, Hidenori Matsui et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12484v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.12484v1</a></p>

<p>We have studied the evolution of the central hundred pc region of barred galaxies by performing numerical simulations realizing multi-phase nature of gas. Our simulations have shown that a stellar bar produces an oval gas ring namely the $x$-2 ring within $1~{\rm kpc}$ as the bar grows. The ring is self-gravitationally unstable enough to trigger formations of gas clouds. Although the gas clouds initially rotate in the $x$-2 ring, cloud-cloud collisions and/or energy injections into the gas ring by Type II supernovae deviate some of the clouds from the ring orbit. After the deviation, the deviated clouds repeat collisions with the other clouds, which rotate in the $x$-2 ring, during several rotations. These processes effectively reduce the angular momentum of the deviated gas cloud. As a result, the gas cloud finally falls into the galactic center, and episodic gas supply to the galactic center takes place.</p>
