<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Features of Charged Lepton Flavor Violation in an $A_4$ Symmetric Neutrino Mass Model</strong>, Pravesh Chndra Awasthi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23747v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23747v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino flavour oscillations imply that there must be charged lepton flavour violation (CLFV) also. Different neutrino mass models predict different patterns of CLFV decays. Neutrino mass generation through standard see-saw mechanisms leads to the prediction that the branching ratios of meson CLFV decays will always be smaller than the corresponding radiative CLFV decays. In this work, we analyse an interesting neutrino mass model, based on $A_4$ symmetry, in which the symmetry and the symmetry-breaking pattern lead the neutrino mixing matrix to be of tri-bimaximal (TBM) form. In this model, we find that the meson CLFV decay amplitudes are not correlated to the corresponding radiative CLFV amplitudes, unlike in the case of see-saw models. The branching ratios of radiative CLFV decays are predicted to be negligibly small in this model, but those of the meson CLFV decays can be large enough to be observable in the near future.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Accretion Regimes of Neutrino-Cooled Flows onto Black Holes</strong>, Javiera Hernández-Morales et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23691v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23691v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino-cooled accretion disks can form in the aftermath of neutron-star mergers as well as during the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars (collapsars) and the accretion-induced collapse of rapidly rotating white dwarfs. Due to Pauli blocking as electrons become degenerate at sufficiently high accretion rates $\dot{M}$, the resulting ‘self-neutronization’ of the dissociated accreting plasma makes these astrophysical systems promising sources of rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis (the r-process). We present a one-dimensional general-relativistic, viscous-hydrodynamic model of neutrino-cooled accretion disks around black holes. With collapsars, super-collapsars and very massive star collapse in mind, we chart the composition of the accretion flow and systematically explore different radiatively efficient and inefficient accretion regimes with increasing $\dot M$, across a vast parameter space of $\dot{M}\sim 10^{-6}-10^6 M_\odot \,\text{s}^{-1}$, black hole masses of $M_\bullet\sim 1 - 10^4 M_\odot$ and dimensionless spins of $\chi_\bullet \in [0,1)$, as well as $\alpha$-viscosity values of $\alpha\sim 10^{-3}-1$. We show that these accretion regimes are separated by characteristic thresholds $\dot{M}_{\rm char}$ that follow power laws $\dot M_{\rm char}\propto M_{\bullet}^\alpha \alpha^\beta$ and that can be understood based on analytic approximations we derive. We find that outflows from such disks are promising sites of r-process nucleosynthesis up to $M_\bullet \lesssim 3000 M_\odot$. These give rise to lanthanide-bearing ‘red’ super-kilonovae transients mostly for $M_\bullet \lesssim 200-500 M_\odot$ and lanthanide suppressed ‘blue’ super-kilonovae for larger $M_\bullet$. Proton-rich outflows can develop specifically for large black hole masses ($M_\bullet \gtrsim 100 M_\odot$) in certain accretion regimes, which may give rise to proton-rich isotopes via the $\nu$p-process.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Latest neutrino results from the FASER experiment and their implications for forward hadron production</strong>, FASER Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23552v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23552v1</a></p>

<p>The muon puzzle – an excess of muons relative to simulation predictions in ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray air showers – has been reported by many experiments. This suggests that forward particle production in hadronic interactions is not fully understood. Some of the scenarios proposed to resolve this predict reduced production of forward neutral pions and enhanced production of forward kaons (or other particles). The FASER experiment at the LHC is located 480 m downstream of the ATLAS interaction point and is sensitive to neutrinos and muons, which are the decay products of forward charged pions and kaons. In this study, the latest measurements of electron and muon neutrino fluxes are presented using the data corresponding to 9.5 $\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ and 65.6 $\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ of proton-proton collisions with $\sqrt{s}=13.6~\mathrm{TeV}$ by the FASER$\nu$ and the FASER electronic detector, respectively. These fluxes are compared with predictions from recent hadronic interaction models, including EPOS-LHCr, SIBYLL 2.3e, and QGSJET 3. The predictions are generally consistent with the measured fluxes from FASER, although some discrepancies appear in certain energy bins. More precise flux measurements with additional data will follow soon, enabling validation of pion, kaon, and charm meson production with finer energy binning, reduced uncertainties, and multi-differential analyses.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Consistent $N_{\rm eff}$ fitting in big bang nucleosynthesis analysis</strong>, Sougata Ganguly et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23354v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23354v1</a></p>

<p>The effective number of neutrino species, $N_{\rm eff}$, serves as a key fitting parameter extensively employed in cosmological studies. In this work, we point out a fundamental inconsistency in the conventional treatment of $N_{\rm eff}$ in big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), particularly regarding its applicability to new physics scenarios where $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, the deviation of $N_{\rm eff}$ from the standard BBN prediction, is negative. To ensure consistent interpretation, it is imperative to either restrict the allowed range of $N_{\rm eff}$ or systematically adjust neutrino-induced reaction rates based on physically motivated assumptions. As a concrete example, we consider a simple scenario in which a negative $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ arises from entropy injection into the electromagnetic sector due to the decay of long-lived particles after neutrino decoupling. This process dilutes the neutrino density and suppresses the rate of neutrino-driven neutron-proton conversion. Under this assumption, we demonstrate that the resulting BBN constraints on $N_{\rm eff}$ deviate significantly from those obtained by the conventional, but unphysical, extrapolation of dark radiation scenarios into the $\Delta N_{\rm eff} &lt; 0$ regime.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Simulation-based inference for Precision Neutrino Physics through Neural Monte Carlo tuning</strong>, A. Gavrikov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23297v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23297v1</a></p>

<p>Precise modeling of detector energy response is crucial for next-generation neutrino experiments which present computational challenges due to lack of analytical likelihoods. We propose a solution using neural likelihood estimation within the simulation-based inference framework. We develop two complementary neural density estimators that model likelihoods of calibration data: conditional normalizing flows and a transformer-based regressor. We adopt JUNO - a large neutrino experiment - as a case study. The energy response of JUNO depends on several parameters, all of which should be tuned, given their non-linear behavior and strong correlations in the calibration data. To this end, we integrate the modeled likelihoods with Bayesian nested sampling for parameter inference, achieving uncertainties limited only by statistics with near-zero systematic biases. The normalizing flows model enables unbinned likelihood analysis, while the transformer provides an efficient binned alternative. By providing both options, our framework offers flexibility to choose the most appropriate method for specific needs. Finally, our approach establishes a template for similar applications across experimental neutrino and broader particle physics.</p>

<p>2025-07-30, <strong>Search for Neutrinos from the Galactic 4FGL Sources with the Pion-bump Signature with IceCube</strong>, Alejandra Granados et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23040v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23040v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the South Pole, covers a cubic kilometer of Antarctic ice, and is designed to detect astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range. While IceCube has recently identified a diffuse flux of neutrinos originating from the Galactic Plane, specific sources of astrophysical neutrinos within the Milky Way remain elusive. Hadronic gamma-rays, produced through the decay of neutral pions, are expected to display a characteristic “pion bump” or “spectral break” around 200 MeV. Recent studies by the Fermi-LAT Collaboration highlight 56 sources from the 4FGL Catalog exhibiting a spectral break in the MeV energy range. Detecting astrophysical neutrinos from these sources would provide compelling evidence for cosmic-ray acceleration in their vicinity. In this analysis, we search for astrophysical neutrino emission from 56 sources showing characteristics of a pion bump using 13 years of IceCube data. Our findings could enhance our understanding of potential cosmic-ray acceleration sites in the galaxy.</p>

<p>2025-07-30, <strong>Lepton number crossings are insufficient for flavor instabilities</strong>, Damiano F. G. Fiorillo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22987v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.22987v1</a></p>

<p>In dense neutrino environments, the mean field of flavor coherence can develop instabilities. A necessary condition is that the flavor lepton number changes sign as a function of energy and/or angle. Whether such a crossing is also sufficient has been a longstanding question. We construct an explicit counterexample: a spectral crossing without accompanying flavor instability, with an even number of crossings being key. This failure is physically understood as Cherenkov-like emission of flavor waves. If flipped-lepton-number neutrinos never dominate among those kinematically allowed to decay, the waves cannot grow.</p>

<p>2025-07-30, <strong>When First Beats Fast: Early Neutrino-Mass-Driven Flavor Instabilities in Supernovae</strong>, Damiano F. G. Fiorillo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22985v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.22985v1</a></p>

<p>Collective neutrino flavor conversions in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) begin with instabilities, initially triggered when the dominant $\nu_e$ outflow concurs with a small flux of antineutrinos with the opposite lepton number, with $\overline{\nu}_e$ dominating over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$. When these “flipped” neutrinos emerge in the energy-integrated angular distribution (angular crossing), they initiate a fast instability. However, before such conditions arise, spectral crossings typically appear within $20~\mathrm{ms}$ of collapse, i.e., local spectral excesses of $\overline{\nu}_e$ over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ along some direction. Therefore, post-processing SN simulations cannot consistently capture later fast instabilities because the early slow ones have already altered the conditions.</p>

<p>2025-07-30, <strong>Hidden Sector Custodial Naturalness</strong>, Thede de Boer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22980v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.22980v1</a></p>

<p>Custodial Naturalness is a recently introduced idea that combines conformal and scalar-sector custodial symmetry to address the electroweak (EW) scale hierarchy problem of the Standard Model (SM). We introduce a new model that realizes Custodial Naturalness without extension of the SM gauge group. The number of new dynamical degrees of freedom is minimized and the custodial symmetry is reduced to $\mathrm{SO}(5)$. This requires a new scalar singlet field that automatically is a good Dark Matter (DM) candidate, produced via freeze-in with moderate couplings. The most minimal scenario allows the quantum critical generation of the EW scale in a phenomenologically viable way requiring a UV completion at around $10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$. Including ingredients for neutrino mass generation can push this scale to $M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$.</p>

<p>2025-07-30, <strong>Characterization of mini-CryoCube detectors from the Ricochet experiment commissioning at the Institut Laue-Langevin</strong>, Antoine Armatol et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22751v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.22751v1</a></p>

<p>The Ricochet experiment aims to measure the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering process from antineutrinos emitted by a research nuclear reactor operated by the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France). This article presents a description of the Ricochet experimental installation and the detector performance achieved during its commissioning with a mini-CryoCube module consisting of three 42-gram germanium cryogenic calorimeters. The baseline resolutions and background levels are reported both during reactor-on and reactor-off periods, and as noise mitigation techniques were improved. A baseline resolution of 40 eV electron equivalent was achieved for the ionization channel after setup improvements, and the phonon channel resolutions ranged from 50 to 80 eV of total phonon energy. In the energy region from 2 to 7 keV, a nuclear recoil rate of 15(2) events/(kg day keV) is measured during the reactor-off period selecting events in coincidence with muon veto signals. This rate is in agreement with the cosmogenic neutron rate calculated from GEANT4 simulations. After the rejection of events in coincidence with signals in the muon veto detectors, a combined 90% C.L. limit on the nuclear recoil background of &lt; 9 events/(kg day keV) is obtained in that energy region during the reactor-on period, which is compatible with our GEANT4 model calculation corresponding to a total rate of 5 events/(kg day keV). The sensitivity of this analysis was however found to be limited by a surface event contamination which is currently being addressed by the Ricochet Collaboration with upgraded detectors.</p>

<p>2025-07-30, <strong>RENE experiment for the sterile neutrino search using reactor neutrinos</strong>, Byeongsu Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22376v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.22376v1</a></p>

<p>This paper summarizes the details of the Reactor Experiment for Neutrinos and Exotics (RENE) experiment. It covers the detector construction, Monte Carlo (MC) simulation study, and physics expectations. The primary goal of the RENE project is to investigate the sterile neutrino oscillation at $\Delta{m}^{2}_{41}\sim 2\,{\rm{eV}^{2}}$. which overlap with the allowed region predicted by the Reactor Antineutrino Anomaly (RAA). On the other hand, the STEREO and PROSPECT experiments have excluded certain regions of the parameter space with 95 \% confidence level (C.L.), while the joint study conducted by RENO and NEOS suggests possible indications of sterile neutrinos at $\Delta{m}^{2}_{41}\sim2.4\,{\rm{eV}^{2}}$ and $\sim{1.7}{\,\rm{eV}^{2}}$ with sin$^{2}\theta_{41} &lt; 0.01$. Accordingly, a more meticulous investigation of these remaining regions continues to be a scientifically valuable endeavor. This paper reports the technical details of the detector and physics objectives.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>High-redshift Galaxies from JWST Observations in More Realistic Dark Matter Halo Models</strong>, Saeed Fakhry et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23742v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23742v1</a></p>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled unexpectedly massive galaxy candidates at high redshifts, challenging standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological predictions. In this work, we study the predictions of more realistic dark matter halo models combined with modified matter power spectra for interpreting JWST observations of high-redshift galaxies. We employ three halo mass functions: the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) model and two physically motivated alternatives introduced by Del Popolo (DP1 and DP2). Our analysis of cumulative stellar mass densities at $z \simeq 8$–$10$ reveals that the standard ST mass function systematically underpredicts JWST observations, achieving marginal consistency only with high star formation efficiencies. In contrast, the DP1 and DP2 models demonstrate significantly improved agreement with observations even within standard $\Lambda$CDM, with statistical consistency within $1$–$2\sigma$ for moderate star formation efficiencies. When combined with modified power spectra, these refined halo models achieve suitable agreement with JWST data across broad parameter ranges, particularly for steeper spectral indices that amplify high-mass halo formation. Crucially, we find that moderate star formation efficiencies coupled with small-scale power enhancements provide robust reconciliation between theory and observations, eliminating the need for extreme astrophysical assumptions. Our results demonstrate that incorporating realistic halo collapse physics, often neglected in standard analyses, can substantially alleviate apparent tensions between JWST observations and $\Lambda$CDM predictions, highlighting the critical importance of small-scale structure formation physics in early cosmic epochs.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Quantum-enhanced dark matter detection using Schrödinger cat states</strong>, Pan Zheng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23538v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23538v1</a></p>

<p>Quantum metrology enables sensitive dark matter detection, particularly using nonclassical states, such as Schr"odinger cat states featuring sub-Planck interference structures in microwave cavities. Here, we report the first experimental application of four-component Schr"odinger cat states within a high-quality superconducting microwave cavity to detect dark photons, a potential dark matter candidate. We demonstrate an 8.1-fold enhancement in the signal photon rate and constrain the dark photon kinetic mixing angle to an unprecedented $\epsilon &lt; 7.32 \times 10^{-16}$ near 6.44~GHz (26.6~$\mu$eV). By employing a parametric sideband drive to actively tune the cavity frequency, we achieve dark photon searches and background subtraction across multiple frequency bins, yielding a sensitivity at the $10^{-16}$ level within a 100~kHz bandwidth. Our Schr"odinger’s cat-assisted detection (SCaD) scheme demonstrates a substantial improvement over previous results, promising potential implications in quantum-enhanced searches for new physics.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Probing Cosmic Ray Composition and Muon-philic Dark Matter via Muon Tomography</strong>, Cheng-en Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23458v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23458v1</a></p>

<p>This work presents a novel cosmic-ray scattering experiment employing a Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) muon tomography system. By introducing the scattering angle between incident and outgoing cosmic-ray tracks as a key observable, this approach enables simultaneous studies of secondary cosmic-ray composition and searching for new physics. During a 63-day campaign, 1.18 million cosmic ray scattering events were recorded and analyzed. By performing combined template fits to the observed angular distribution, particle abundances are measured, for example, resolving the electron component at $\sim 2\%$ precision. Furthermore, constraints are established on elastic muon-dark matter (DM) scattering cross-sections for muon-philic dark matter. At the 95\% confidence level, the limit reaches 1.62 $\times$ $10^{-17}$ $\rm{cm}^{2}$ for 1 GeV slow DM, demonstrating sensitivity limit to light muon-coupled slow DM.</p>

<p>Simulated galaxy catalogues have become an essential tool for preparing and exploiting observations from galaxy surveys. They constitute a key ingredient in modelling the systematic uncertainties present in the analysis. However, in order to reach the large volume and high precision required for galaxy surveys, we generally populate dark matter haloes with galaxies following certain theoretical recipes. Such recipes contain free parameters that are calibrated comparing the simulations against observations, but the creation of galaxy mocks is a stochastic process with a large number of free parameters to calibrate. We present a new pipeline, based on the differential evolution algorithm, that can calibrate galaxy mocks in a fully automated way for realistic scenarios with a large parameter space. We apply the pipeline to galaxy mocks built on a combination of halo occupation distribution and sub-halo abundance matching techniques. We show that our pipeline can properly calibrate the galaxy mocks against observations for both $\Lambda$CDM and modified gravity halo catalogues. This type of calibration pipeline provides a new tool for automating the calibration of future massive galaxy mocks.</p>

<p>The values of the Hubble constant inferred from local measurements and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) exhibit an approximately 5 sigma tension. Some have suggested this tension is alleviated if matter is converted to dark radiation via dark matter decay. As it is not clear that dark matter decays, we instead examine the effects of converting matter to gravitational radiation via black hole mergers. We consider mergers of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), mergers of stellar-mass black holes, and the formation of SMBHs from mergers of smaller black holes. We find that these processes cannot alleviate the tension, as an unrealistically large merger rate, or an overproduction of SMBHs is required. We also consider whether one can use the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect to constrain mechanisms that form SMBHs from mergers of smaller black holes. We find that this is also too small to be viable.</p>

<p>Recent observations by JWST reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of rapidly growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe, underscoring the need for improved models for their origin and growth. Employing new full radiative transfer hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, we investigate the local and intergalactic feedback of SMBH progenitors for the Population III.1 scenario, i.e., efficient formation of supermassive stars from pristine, undisturbed dark matter minihalos. Our cosmological simulations capture the R-type expansion phase of these Pop III.1 stars, with their H-ionizing photon luminosities of $\sim10^{53}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ generating HII regions that extend deep into the intergalactic medium, reaching comoving radii of $r_{\rm HII}\sim 1\,{\rm cMpc}$. We vary both the Pop III.1 ionization flux and cosmological formation environments, finding the former regulates their final $r_{\rm HII}$, whereas the latter is more important in setting their formation redshift. We use the results from our radiation-hydrodynamics simulations to estimate the cosmic number density of SMBHs, $n_{\rm SMBH}$, expected from Pop III.1 progenitors. We find $n_{\rm SMBH}\sim10^{-1}\,{\rm cMpc}^{-3}$, consistent with the results inferred from recent observations of the local and high redshift universe. Overall, this establishes Pop III.1 progenitors as viable candidates for the formation of the first SMBHs, and emphasises the importance of exploring heavy mass seed scenarios.</p>

<p>2025-07-30, <strong>Characterization of spurious-electron signals in the double-phase argon TPC of the DarkSide-50 experiment</strong>, DarkSide-50 Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23003v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23003v1</a></p>

<p>Spurious-electron signals in dual-phase noble-liquid time projection chambers have been observed in both xenon and argon Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). This paper presents the first comprehensive study of spurious electrons in argon, using data collected by the DarkSide-50 experiment at the INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS). Understanding these events is a key factor in improving the sensitivity of low-mass dark matter searches exploiting ionization signals in dual-phase noble liquid TPCs.   We find that a significant fraction of spurious-electron events, ranging from 30 to 70% across the experiment’s lifetime, are caused by electrons captured from impurities and later released with delays of order 5-50 ms. The rate of spurious-electron events is found to correlate with the operational condition of the purification system and the total event rate in the detector. Finally, we present evidence that multi-electron spurious electron events may originate from photo-ionization of the steel grid used to define the electric fields. These observations indicate the possibility of reduction of the background in future experiments and hint at possible spurious electron production mechanisms.</p>

<p>2025-07-30, <strong>Gamma-Rays and Gravitational Waves from Inelastic Higgs Portal Dark Matter</strong>, Dan Hooper et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22975v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.22975v1</a></p>

<p>We explore a simple and predictive dark matter scenario involving a complex scalar field, $\phi$, coupled to the Higgs portal with no additional field content. In the UV, the field possesses a global $U(1)$ symmetry which is broken by mass terms and Higgs portal interactions. In the mass basis, the complex field splits into a pair of real scalars with a small mass splitting (in analogy to pseudo-Dirac fermions), such that the Higgs portal acquires both diagonal and off-diagonal terms with respect to these eigenstates. In the parameter space where the off-diagonal interaction predominates, this scenario is safe from direct detection constraints. Moreover, this model provides a viable explanation for the longstanding Galactic Center gamma-ray excess. Additionally, this model influences the Higgs potential in a way that could facilitate a strong first-order electroweak phase transition in the early universe, potentially leading to a stochastic gravitational wave background that could fall within the reach of upcoming space-based detectors.</p>

<p>2025-07-30, <strong>From Capture to Collapse: Revisiting Black Hole formation by Fermionic Asymmetric Dark Matter in Neutron Stars</strong>, Sandra Robles et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22881v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.22881v1</a></p>

<p>Fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) can be captured in neutron stars (NSs) via scatterings with the star constituents. The absence of dark matter annihilation due to its asymmetric nature leads to ADM accumulation in the NS core, potentially reaching densities sufficient to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit and trigger its gravitational collapse into a black hole (BH), eventually consuming the NS from within. Therefore, the existence and observation of old neutron stars provides a means to constrain the properties of ADM. We revisit previous constraints on the mass and scattering cross section off neutrons of fermionic ADM across a class of models. We critically examine common simplifying approximations used in the literature to derive these limits. Our analysis includes improved treatments of dark matter capture, thermalization, BH formation, accretion, and evaporation. We find that previous results can be relaxed by a few orders of magnitude once these effects are properly accounted for.</p>

<p>The large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe is an important probe for deviations from the canonical cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. A statistically significant detection of any deviations would signify the presence of new physics or the breakdown of any number of the underlying assumptions of the standard cosmological model or possible systematic errors in the data. In this paper, we quantify the ability of the LSS data products of the spectroscopic survey of the Euclid mission, together with other contemporary surveys, to improve the constraints on deviations from $\Lambda$CDM in the redshift range $0&lt;z&lt;1.75$. We consider both currently available growth rate data and simulated data with specifications from Euclid and external surveys, based on $\Lambda$CDM and a modified gravity (MoG) model with an evolving Newton’s constant (denoted $\mu$CDM), and carry out a binning method and a machine learning reconstruction, based on genetic algorithms (GAs), of several LSS null tests. Using the forecast Euclid growth data from the spectroscopic survey in the range $0.95&lt;z&lt;1.75$, we find that in combination with external data products (covering the range $0&lt;z&lt;0.95$), Euclid will be able to improve on current constraints of null tests of the LSS on average by a factor of eight when using a binning method and a factor of six when using the GAs. Our work highlights the need for synergies between Euclid and other surveys, but also the usefulness of statistical analyses, such as GAs, in order to disentangle any degeneracies in the cosmological parameters. Both are necessary to provide tight constraints over an extended redshift range and to probe for deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model.</p>

<p>Modern large scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations require robust tools capable of analysing their data outputs in a parallel and efficient manner. We introduce SOAP (Spherical Overdensity and Aperture Processor), a Python package designed to compute halo and galaxy properties from SWIFT simulations after being post-processed with a subhalo finder. SOAP takes a subhalo catalogue as input and calculates a wide array of properties for each object. SOAP offers parallel processing capabilities via mpi4py for efficient handling of large datasets, and allows for consistent property calculation across multiple halo finders. SOAP supports various halo definitions, including spherical overdensities and fixed physical apertures, providing flexibility for diverse observational comparisons. The package is compatible with both dark matter-only and full hydrodynamic simulations, producing HDF5 catalogues that are integrated with the swiftsimio package for seamless unit handling.</p>

<p>The MAGIC telescopes, located at Observatorio El Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma, Spain) are two Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes observing the Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays. They are run by an international collaboration composed of over 40 institutions from 12 countries. The first telescope was inaugurated in October 2003. The commissioning of the second finished in 2008. The MAGIC telescopes were designed to lower the energies to which ground based telescopes had access as well as to be able to point to any direction in the sky in less than 25 seconds. The former required the large reflective surface of 17 meters as well as an effort to optimise the mirror reflectivity and photo sensor sensitivity. The latter was achieved by minimising the weight of the full instrument using for instance carbon fibre reinforced plastic tubes for the mirror frame. The sensitivity of the MAGIC telescopes have been improving over the years thanks to hardware upgrades as well as new analysis techniques, which allowed the collaboration to keep a rich scientific program. The discovery of VHE emission from Gamma Ray Bursts and pulsars have called for a revision of the models that explain the production of gamma rays there. Both the observation of sources in flaring state as well as a systematic monitoring of sources have provided valuable data to better understand astrophysical sources both in our Galaxy and outside it. Relevant constraints on fundamental quantities like dark matter cross-section, quantum gravity scale and density of extragalactic background light have also been extracted from the observations.</p>

<p>2025-07-30, <strong>Darksuite: an Algorithm for Dark Matter-Admixed Neutron Stars</strong>, Nguyen Thi Lan Anh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22415v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.22415v1</a></p>

<p>Gravitational-wave observations provide a unique window into the fundamental nature of massive objects. In particular, neutron star equations of state have been constrained due to the success of gravitational wave observatories. Recently, the possibility of detecting dark matter-admixed neutron stars via ground-based laser interferometry has been explored. Dark matter would impact the gravitational waveform of an inspiraling neutron star system through tidal parameters, namely the tidal deformability ($\lambda$, incurring a phase shift to the frequency evolution of the signal. This phase shift would depend both on the percentage of dark matter within the star and its particle nature, e.g., bosonic or fermionic. Indirect detection of dark matter through admixture within neutron stars can provide insight into the neutron equation of state, as well as constraints on the density of dark matter in the universe. In this work, we introduce \texttt{Darksuite}, a proposed extension of the \lal{} software framework, designed to model the gravitational wave signatures of dark-matter-admixed neutron stars. This framework employs simulations from the two-fluid, generally relativistic Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, wherein one fluid is ordinary nuclear matter and the other is dark matter. We demonstrate interpolation of values from a bank of simulations, enabling the study of binary systems where at least one component may be a dark-matter-admixed neutron star. By leveraging existing methodologies within \lal{} for tidal phase corrections and supplementing them with dark matter effects, \texttt{Darksuite} provides a means to generate and analyze gravitational waveforms for these exotic systems.</p>

<p>2025-07-30, <strong>Streams and Shells Decoded: A Density-Driven Approach to Stellar Clustering in Galactic Halos with AstroLink</strong>, Viraj Ekanayaka et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22333v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.22333v1</a></p>

<p>We present a novel method to differentiate stream-like and shell-like tidal remnants of stellar systems in galactic halos using the density-based approach of the clustering algorithm AstroLink. While previous studies lean on observation, phase-space, and action-space based criteria for stream and shell determination, we introduce AstroLink’s ordered-density plot and cluster identification as a viable tool for classification. For a given data set, the AstroLink ordered-density plot reveals the density-based hierarchical clustering structure from which the resultant clusters are identified as being statistically significant overdensities. Using simulations of sub-halo disruptions in an external potential to generate samples of tidal structures, we find that the curvature of the ordered-density plot is positive for stream-like structures and negative for shell-like structures. Comparisons with more standard classification techniques reveal strong agreement on which structures typically fit into stream-like and shell-like categories. Furthermore, we investigate the properties of clustered stream and shell samples in radial phase space and energy-angle space. Given the sensitivity of stellar tidal structures to their host dark matter halos, the identification and subsequent classification of these structures provide exciting avenues of investigation in galactic evolution dynamics and dark matter structure formation.</p>

<p>2025-07-31, <strong>Jet-Driven Formation of Bipolar Rings in Planetary Nebulae: Numerical Simulations Inspired by NGC 1514</strong>, Muhammad Akashi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23670v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.23670v1</a></p>

<p>We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of jets launched into a dense shell, reproducing two rings in a bipolar structure that resemble the two dusty rings of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 1514. The scenario we simulate assumes that a strong binary interaction enhanced the mass loss rate from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar progenitor of NGC 1514, and shortly thereafter, the main-sequence companion accreted mass from the AGB star, launching a pair of jets. We find that adiabatic flows, where radiative losses are negligible, produce prominent rings, as observed in the infrared in NGC 1514. In contrast, when radiative cooling is significant, the rings are thin and faint. Our results reinforce the prevailing notion that jets play a substantial role in shaping planetary nebulae (PNe). More generally, as the binary companion to the central star of NGC 1514 avoided common envelope evolution, our results suggest that jets play a major role in many binary systems experiencing stable mass transfer at high rates. This conclusion complements the view that jets play a significant role in unstable mass transfer, specifically in common envelope evolution. Studies of strongly interacting binary systems, whether stable or not, should include jets. If jets continue to be active after ring formation, the outcomes are circum-jet rings, as observed in some other PNe and core-collapse supernova remnants.</p>

<p>The Thomas-Fermi approximation is a powerful method that has been widely used to describe atomic structures, finite nuclei, and nonuniform matter in supernovae and neutron-star crusts. Nonuniform nuclear matter at subnuclear density is assumed to be composed of a lattice of heavy nuclei surrounded by dripped nucleons, and the Wigner-Seitz cell is commonly introduced to simplify the calculations. The self-consistent Thomas–Fermi approximation can be employed to study both a nucleus surrounded by nucleon gas in the Wigner-Seitz cell and an isolated nucleus in the nuclide chart. A detailed comparison is made between the self-consistent Thomas-Fermi approximation and the relativistic mean-field approach for the description of finite nuclei, based on the same nuclear interaction. These results are then examined using experimental data from the corresponding nuclei.</p>

<p>We present 115 compact radio point sources in three galaxies, NGC 5474, NGC 4631 and M51, taken in the most extended (A-)configuration of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 10GHz. Several of these compact radio point sources have diffuse counterparts identified in previous multi-band studies of resolved radio continuum emission. We find compact counterparts to eight star forming regions, four anomalous microwave emission candidates, and one supernova remnant (SN 2011dh). Nine of the compact radio sources match X-ray counterparts, the majority of which are background galaxies. These AGN are all within the D25 (isophotal diameter) of the host galaxy and might act as contaminants for X-ray binary population studies, highlighting the need for high-resolution multi-band imaging. This study showcases the broad number of science cases that require sensitive radio facilities, like the upcoming Square Kilometre Array and the planned next generation Very Large Array.</p>

<p>The young neutron star X-ray binary, Cir X-1, resides within its natal supernova remnant and experiences ongoing outbursts every 16.5 days, likely due to periastron passage in an eccentric orbit. We present the deepest ever radio image of the field, which reveals relativistic jet-punched bubbles that are aligned with the mean axis of the smaller-scale jets observed close to the X-ray binary core. We are able to measure the minimum energy for the bubble, which is around $E_{min}$ = $10^{45} $ erg. The nature and morphological structure of the source were investigated through spectral index mapping and numerical simulations. The spectral index map reveals a large fraction of the nebula’s radio continuum has a steep slope, associated with optically thin synchrotron emission, although there are distinct regions with flatter spectra. Our data are not sensitive enough to measure the spectral index of the protruding bubbles. We used the PLUTO code to run relativistic hydrodynamic simulations to try and qualitatively reproduce the observations with a combined supernova-plus-jet system. We are able to do so using a simplified model in which the asymmetrical bubbles are best represented by supernova explosion which is closely followed (within 100 years) by a phase of very powerful jets lasting less than 1000 years. These are the first observations revealing the initial breakout of neutron star jets from their natal supernova remnant, and further support the scenario in which Cir X-1 is a younger relation of the archetypal jet source SS433.</p>

<p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will soon survey the southern sky, delivering a depth and sky coverage that is unprecedented in time domain astronomy. As part of commissioning, Data Preview 1 (DP1) has been released. It comprises a ComCam observing campaign between November and December 2024 with multi-band imaging of seven fields, covering roughly 0.4 square degree each, provides a first glimpse into the data products that will become available once the Legacy Survey of Space and Time begins. In this work, we search three fields for extragalactic transients. We identify six new extragalactic transients, and three known ones from a sample of 369,644 difference image analysis objects. Photometric classification using \texttt{Superphot+} indicates that this sample likely comprises six type Ia, two type II, two type Ibc and one type IIn supernovae. Our findings are in slight tension with supernova detection rate predictions from the literature of $12\pm3$ SN Ia and $3\pm1$ core-collapse supernovae likely due to the lack of suitable templates. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates the quality of the data products delivered in DP1 and indicates that Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey and Space and Time (LSST) is well placed to fulfill its discovery potential in time domain astronomy.</p>

<p>2025-07-30, <strong>Is this the fall of the $Λ$CDM throne? Evidence for dynamical dark energy rising from combinations of different types of datasets</strong>, Mustapha Ishak et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22856v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.22856v1</a></p>

<p>We derive multiple constraints on dark energy and compare dynamical dark energy models with a time-varying equation of state ($w_0 w_a$CDM) versus a cosmological constant model ($\Lambda$CDM). We use Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) from DESI and DES, Cosmic Microwave Background (Planck) with and without lensing from Planck and ACT (noted CMB and CMBL, respectively), supernova (SN), and cross-correlations between galaxy positions and galaxy lensing from DES. First, we use pairs or trios of datasets where we exclude one type of datasets each time and categorize them as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NO SN",</code>NO CMB” and ``NO BAO” combinations. In all cases, we find that the combinations favor the $w_0 w_a$CDM model over $\Lambda$CDM, with significance ranging from 2.3$\sigma$ to 3.3$\sigma$. For example, DESI+DESY6BAO+CMB yields 3.2$\sigma$ without SN, DESI+DESY6BAO+DESY5SN yields 3.3$\sigma$ without CMB, and CMB+DESY5SN+DES3x2pts yields 2.6$\sigma$ without BAO. The persistence of this pattern across various dataset combinations even when any of the dataset is excluded supports an overall validation of this trending result regardless of any specific dataset. Next, we use larger combinations of these datasets after verifying their mutual consistency within the $w_0 w_a$CDM model. We find combinations that give significance levels $\sim$4$\sigma$, with DESI+DESY6BAO+CMBL+DESY5SN reaching 4.4$\sigma$. In sum, while we need to remain prudent, the combination of the first step that supports a validation of the pattern of these results beyond any single type of datasets and their associated systematics, together with the second step showing high-significance results when such datasets are combined, presents a compelling overall portrait in favor of a dynamical dark energy with a time-evolving equation of state over a cosmological constant, and constitutes a serious challenge to the $\Lambda$CDM model’s reign.

<p>Context: SN 2024ggi is a Type II supernova (SN) discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 (D $\approx6.7\pm0.d$ Mpc) on 2024 April 03.21 UT. Its proximity enabled a detailed investigation of the SN’s properties and its progenitor star. This work focuses on the optical evolution of SN 2024ggi at the nebular phase. Aims: We investigate the progenitor properties and possible asymmetries in the ejecta by studying the nebular phase evolution between days 287 and 400 after the explosion. Methods: We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi during the nebular phase, obtained with the Las Campanas and Gemini South Observatories. Four nebular spectra were taken at 287, 288, 360, and 396 days post-explosion, supplemented by late-time $uBVgri$-band photometry spanning $320-400$ days. The analysis of the nebular emission features is performed to probe ejecta asymmetries. Based on the [O I] flux and [O I]/[Ca II] ratio, and comparisons with spectra models from the literature, we arrive to an estimate of the progenitor mass. Additionally, we construct the bolometric light curve from optical photometry and near-infrared data to derive the synthesized nickel mass. Results: Our analysis suggests a progenitor zero-age-main-sequence mass between $12-15 M_\odot$. The late-time bolometric light curve is consistent with a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.05-0.06 M_\odot$. The line profiles exhibit only minor changes over the observed period and suggest a roughly symmetrical ejecta, with a possible clump of oxygen-rich material moving towards the observer. No signatures of circumstellar material interaction are detected up to 400 days after the explosion.</p>

<p>2025-07-30, <strong>Confined Circumstellar Material as a Dust Formation Site in Type II Supernovae</strong>, Yuki Takei et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22763v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.22763v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a model for dust formation in Type II supernovae (SNe) interacting with confined circumstellar material (CSM), motivated by recent time-domain surveys that have revealed a substantial fraction of SN progenitors to be surrounded by CSM ejected shortly before core-collapse. We simulate the pre-SN mass eruption and the resulting confined CSM using the open-source code CHIPS, and follow the subsequent evolution of the SN ejecta and its interaction with the CSM. We show that a cold dense shell (CDS) is formed at the radiative shock under a wide range of conditions and later undergoes rapid adiabatic cooling during free expansion, leading to efficient dust condensation. The resulting dust mass ranges from $\sim10^{-3}\,M_\odot$ to $0.1\,M_\odot$, depending on the mass and spatial extent of the CSM. We further calculate the infrared (IR) emission from the newly formed dust and find broad consistency with observations of SN~1998S. Notably, the IR light curve exhibits a rapid rise within $\lesssim10\,{\rm d}$, closely resembling that of kilonovae (KNe). This suggests that dust emission powered by confined CSM interaction may be also discovered in KN searches. Moreover, the high-density environment of the CDS may allow dust grains to grow to larger sizes, enhancing their survivability against destruction by reverse shocks propagating from the interstellar medium at later times.</p>

<p>We revisit the evolution of cosmic acceleration in a spatially flat $w_0w_a$CDM universe, in which the equation of state of dark energy takes the CPL parametrization, using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), in combination with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and several type Ia supernova datasets, including PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5. We analyze the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ and the jerk parameter $j(z)$ and further validate our results using the $Om(z)$ diagnostic. Our findings indicate significant deviations from the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Specifically, DESI BAO, DESI BAO + CMB, DESI BAO + CMB + Union3, and DESI BAO + CMB + DESY5 all provide strong evidence for a slowing down of cosmic acceleration at late times, as indicated by $j(0) &lt; 0$ at more than 1$\sigma$ confidence level, within the framework of $w_0w_a$CDM model. These results suggest that in the $w_0w_a$CDM universe cosmic acceleration has already peaked and is now in a phase of decline.</p>

<p>2025-07-30, <strong>The Binary Fraction of B-type Runaway Stars from LAMOST DR8</strong>, Kun Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22569v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.22569v1</a></p>

<p>Runaway stars are defined as stars that depart from their birth clusters at high peculiar velocities. There are two main mechanisms for the formation of runaway stars, i.e., the binary-supernova scenario (BSS) and the dynamical ejection scenario (DES). Investigating the binary fraction of runaway stars is an important step in further exploring the relative significance of the two mechanisms. We analyzed the binary fraction of 203 Galactic B-type runaway stars identified in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope Data Release 8 database. Our analysis of radial velocity variations in the runaway star sample reveals an observed spectroscopic binary fraction of $5.4\%\pm 1.6\%$, representing the proportion of objects that exhibit statistically significant variations in radial velocity with amplitudes larger than $\rm 16~km~s^{-1}$. We employed a Monte Carlo method to correct for observational biases and determined an intrinsic binary fraction of $27\%\pm 8\%$. The period and mass ratio distributions that best reproduce the observation are $f(P)\propto P^{-5.7}$ for $1\leq P\leq 1000$ days, and $f(q)\propto q^{-3.6}$ for $0.1\leq q\leq 1.0$, indicating a preference for binaries with shorter periods and less massive companions compared to a uniform distribution. The intrinsic binary fraction, in combination with previous studies on the binary fractions of runaway stars formed by the BSS and the DES, implies that both scenarios contribute comparably to the formation of Galactic B-type runaway stars, where the ratio of the BSS to the DES is 0.86.</p>
