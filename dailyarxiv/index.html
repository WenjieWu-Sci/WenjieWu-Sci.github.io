<p>2025-11-04, <strong>Progress on Constraining the Strange Quark Contribution to the Nucleon Spin</strong>, S. F. Pate et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02575v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.02575v1</a></p>

<p>We report on a global fit of neutral-current elastic (NCE) neutrino-scattering data and parity-violating electron-scattering (PVES) data with the goal of determining the strange quark contribution to the vector and axial form factors of the proton. Knowledge of the strangeness contribution to the axial form factor, $G_A^s(Q^2)$, at low $Q^2$ will reveal the strange quark contribution to the nucleon spin, as $G_A^s(Q^2=0)=\Delta s$. Previous fits [1,2] of this form included data from a variety of PVES experiments (PVA4, HAPPEx, G0, SAMPLE) and the NCE neutrino and anti-neutrino data from BNL E734. These fits did not constrain $G_A^s(Q^2)$ at low $Q^2$ very well because there was no NCE data for $Q^2&lt;0.45$ GeV$^2$. Our new fit includes for the first time MiniBooNE NCE data from both neutrino and anti-neutrino scattering; this experiment used a hydrocarbon target and so a model of the neutrino interaction with the carbon nucleus was required. Three different nuclear models have been employed; a relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) model, the SuperScaling Approximation (SuSA) model, and a spectral function (SF) model [3]. We find a tremendous improvement in the constraint of $G_A^s(Q^2)$ at low $Q^2$ compared to previous work, although more data is needed from NCE measurements that focus on exclusive single-proton final states, for example from MicroBooNE [4]. This work has been published in Physical Review D [5]. [1] S.F. Pate, D. McKee, V. Papavassiliou, Phys. Rev. C78, 015207 (2008) [2] S.F. Pate, D.

<p>2025-11-04, <strong>Searches for heavy neutrinos at 3 TeV CLIC in fat jet final states</strong>, Yao-Bei Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02557v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.02557v1</a></p>

<p>The type-I seesaw mechanism provides an elegant explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses via the introduction of heavy Majorana neutrinos (N), which also constitute a well-motivated extension of the Standard Model. In this work, we explore the production and detection prospects of TeV-scale heavy neutrinos ($m_N \gtrsim 1$ TeV) at a future 3 TeV Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). We focus on two distinct decay topologies: (i) $N \to \ell^\pm W^\mp$ with hadronic $W$ boson decay, leading to a final state with one charged lepton, a hadronic fat-jet $J_W$, and missing transverse energy ($1\ell + J_W + \slashed{E}_T$); and (ii) $N \to \nu h$ with subsequent Higgs decay $h \to b\bar{b}$, yielding a Higgs-tagged fat-jet $J_h$ and $\slashed{E}_T$. Based on comprehensive detector-level simulations and background analysis, we present both $2\sigma$ exclusion limits and $5\sigma$ discovery reaches in the $m_N$-$|V_{\ell N}|^2$ plane. We further extract 95\% confidence level upper limits on the mixing parameter $|V_{\ell N}|^2$, and perform a detailed comparison with existing constraints from direct searches at future colliders and indirect global fits. Our findings demonstrate that a 3 TeV CLIC can improve the sensitivity to $|V_{\ell N}|^2$ by about two orders of magnitude compared to the projected reaches of future hadron colliders, while remaining competitive with other CLIC search channels.</p>

<p>2025-11-04, <strong>Pulse shape simulation for the reduced charge collection layer in p-type high-purity germanium detectors</strong>, P. Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02513v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.02513v1</a></p>

<p>$P$-type high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors are widely used across many scientific domains, and current data analysis methods have served well in many use cases. However, applications like low-background experiments that search for rare physics, such as dark matter, neutrinoless double-beta decay, and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, could profit a lot from a more detailed understanding of the detector response close to the surface. The outer $n^+$ electrode of the $p$-type HPGe detector forms a layer with reduced charge collection, and events originating here can be a critical background source in such experiments. If the difference in detector pulse shape between detector surface and bulk events is known, it can be used to identify and veto these background events. However, a faithful simulation of the detector response in this surface region is difficult and has not been available as a standard method so far. We present a novel three-dimensional pulse shape simulation method for this reduced charge collection (RCC) layer. We have implemented this method as a new feature in the open-source simulation package \emph{SolidStateDetectors.jl} and show a validation of the numerical simulation results with analytical calculations. An experimental study using a $p$-type HPGe detector also validates our approach. The current implementation supports $p$-type HPGe detectors of fairly arbitrary geometry, but is easily adaptable to $n$-type detectors by adjusting the impurity density profile of the layer. It should also be adaptable to other semiconductor materials in a straightforward fashion.</p>

<p>2025-11-04, <strong>NLO heavy-quark contributions to DIS structure functions in the ACOT scheme</strong>, Edoardo Spezzano et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02407v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.02407v2</a></p>

<p>We present next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculations of heavy-quark contributions to deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) structure functions $F_4$ and $F_5$ within the Aivazis–Collins–Olness–Tung (ACOT) scheme, implemented in the open source library \texttt{APFEL++} using \texttt{CT18NLO} parton distribution functions. These structure functions, suppressed by lepton mass effects in light-lepton processes, become significant in muon, tau-lepton and neutrino scattering at facilities such as SHiP, IceCube, and DUNE. Our results reveal NLO corrections up to 10\% relative to leading order, with pronounced heavy-quark effects at low Bjorken-$x$, impacting gluon and strange quark distributions. In the unpolarized case, $F_{4/5}^{\gamma Z}$ and $F_{4/5}^{\gamma}$ do not contribute to the cross section, while the $\gamma Z$ interference becomes accessible with longitudinally polarized lepton beams at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), offering enhanced sensitivity at low $Q^2$ due to reduced $Z$-boson propagator suppression. Analytical NLO expressions have also been derived for the polarized structure functions $g_1$, $g_4$, $g_5$, $g_6$, and $g_7$ in the ACOT framework. These developments enable precise theoretical predictions for upcoming experimental programs and global QCD analyses.</p>

<p>2025-11-04, <strong>Search for Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background with 956.2 days of Super-Kamiokande Gadolinium Dataset</strong>, K. Abe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02222v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.02222v1</a></p>

<p>We report the search result for the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) in neutrino energies beyond 9.3~MeV in the gadolinium-loaded Super-Kamiokande (SK) detector with $22,500\times956.2\(~\rm m^3\cdot day$ exposure. %$22.5{\rm k}\times956.2\)~\rm m^3\cdot day$ exposure. Starting in the summer of 2020, SK introduced 0.01\% gadolinium (Gd) by mass into its ultra-pure water to enhance the neutron capture signal, termed the SK-VI phase. This was followed by a 0.03\% Gd-loading in 2022, a phase referred to as SK-VII. We then conducted a DSNB search using 552.2~days of SK-VI data and 404.0~days of SK-VII data through September 2023. This analysis includes several new features, such as two new machine-learning neutron detection algorithms with Gd, an improved atmospheric background reduction technique, and two parallel statistical approaches. No significant excess over background predictions was found in a DSNB spectrum-independent analysis, and 90\% C.L. upper limits on the astrophysical electron anti-neutrino flux were set. Additionally, a spectral fitting result exhibited a $\sim1.2\sigma$ disagreement with a null DSNB hypothesis, comparable to a previous result from 5823~days of all SK pure water phases.</p>

<p>2025-11-04, <strong>Anisotropy ansatz for the Jeans equations: oblate galaxies</strong>, Leonardo De Deo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02547v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.02547v1</a></p>

<p>In the solution of the Jeans equations for axisymmetric galaxy models the ``$b$-ansatz” is often adopted to prescribe the relation between the vertical and radial components of the velocity dispersion tensor, and close the equations. However, $b$ affects the resulting azimuthal velocity fields quite indirectly, so that the analysis of the model kinematics is usually performed after numerically solving the Jeans equations, a time consuming approach. In a previous work we presented a general method to determine the main properties of the kinematical fields resulting in the $b$-ansatz framework before solving the Jeans equations; results were illustrated by means of disk galaxy models. In this paper we focus more specifically on realistic ellipsoidal galaxy models. It is found that how and where $b$ affects the galaxy kinematical fields is mainly dependent on the flattening of the stellar density distribution, moderately on the presence of a Dark Matter halo, and much less on the specific galaxy density profile. The main trends revealed by the numerical exploration, in particular the fact that more flattened systems can support larger $b$-anisotropy, are explained with the aid of simple ellipsoidal galaxy models, for which most of the analysis can be conducted analytically. The obtained results can be adopted as guidelines for model building and in the interpretation of observational data.</p>

<p>2025-11-04, <strong>General relativistic study of $f$-mode oscillations in neutron stars with gravitationally bound dark matter</strong>, Pinku Routaray et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02443v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.02443v1</a></p>

<p>A comprehensive investigation of nonradial oscillations in neutron star (NS) admixed with gravitationally bounded dark matter (DM) is carried out within the framework of full general relativity. The relativistic mean field (RMF) formalism is employed to illustrate the hadronic equation of state (EOS), while a physically motivated, gravitationally captured, non-uniform fermionic Higgs-portal DM component is incorporated to model DM-admixed NS. The DM distribution is characterized by two free parameters: $\alpha M_\chi$, an effective scaling factor that combines the DM concentration and the DM candidate mass, and $\beta$, a steepness index controlling the DM density distribution. The quasi normal mode (QNM) characteristics such as fundamental ($f$) mode frequency and its corresponding gravitational-wave (GW) damping time ($\tau$) is calculated for DM-admixed NS by solving the general relativistic perturbed equations involving axial as well as polar modes. The study demonstrates how the inclusion of DM distribution modifies the $f$-mode frequency and enhances the damping rate, reflecting a stronger coupling between matter and spacetime perturbations. Considering DM effects, the correlation analysis among DM model parameters, NS observables and QNM characteristics also carried out. Analytic fits for the $f-C-\tau$ and $f-\Lambda -\tau$ relations are constructed and calibrated for DM-admixed NS models. Building upon asteroseismic universal relations (URs), multimessenger constraint from the GW170817 event is employed by mapping the tidal deformability $\Lambda_{1.4}$ into the $(f_{1.4},\tau_{1.4})$ space, thereby providing observational bounds on the oscillation properties of canonical DM-admixed NS model.</p>

<p>2025-11-04, <strong>Signatures of a Schwarzschild-like Black Hole Immersed in Dark Matter Halo</strong>, Akshat Pathrikar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02355v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.02355v1</a></p>

<p>Astrophysical black holes are often surrounded by dark matter, which can influence their dynamics and observational signatures. In this work, we study a Schwarzschild-like black hole immersed in a Dehnen-type $(1,4,2)$ dark matter halo and analyse scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations in this spacetime. We compute quasinormal modes (QNMs) using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation method with Pad'e approximants, investigate particle motion and photon trajectories, and use black hole shadow observations to place constraints on the halo parameters. We further examine the greybody factors associated with Hawking radiation for different perturbation spins. This combined analysis aims to understand how dark matter environments may affect black hole oscillations, radiation properties, and the corresponding observational signatures.</p>

<p>2025-11-04, <strong>Weak-Lensing Analysis of the Galaxy Cluster Abell 85: Constraints on the Merger Scenarios of Its Southern Subcluster</strong>, Soojin Kim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02323v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.02323v1</a></p>

<p>Abell 85 is a nearby (z=0.055) galaxy cluster that hosts a sloshing cool core, a feature commonly reported in relaxed clusters. However, the presence of multiple past and ongoing mergers indicates that it is an active node within the Abell 85/87/89 complex. We present a weak gravitational lensing (WL) analysis using Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging data to understand its assembly history by investigating the dark matter components of the substructures. Our mass reconstruction resolves three substructures associated with the brightest cluster galaxy (main), the southern (S) subcluster, and the southwestern (SW) subcluster, with WL peak significances of $&gt; 6\sigma$, $&gt; 5\sigma$, and $&gt; 4\sigma$, respectively. The locations of these mass peaks are consistent with those of the member galaxies. We estimate the masses of the main cluster ($M_{200c,main} = 2.91 \pm 0.72 \times 10^{14}\ M_\odot$) and the S subcluster ($M_{200c,S} = 1.23 \pm 0.52 \times 10^{14}\ M_\odot$) by fitting a multi-halo Navarro-Frenk-White profile. This $\sim$2:1 mass ratio indicates that the system is undergoing a major merger that is actively shaping the current dynamical state of Abell 85. Incorporating X-ray observations, we discuss the merger phase of the S subcluster and further examine the star-forming activity along the putative filament extending southeast of Abell 85.</p>

<p>2025-11-04, <strong>Dark Matter Freeze-in from a $Z^\prime$ Reheaton</strong>, Avirup Ghosh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02184v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.02184v1</a></p>

<p>We consider the Standard Model (SM) extended by a secluded $U(1)_D$ gauge sector encompassing a Dirac fermion ($\chi$) dark matter (DM), an abelian gauge boson $Z^\prime$ and a SM-singlet complex-scalar field $\Phi$, whose radial component drives cosmic inflation. When the Higgs portal coupling is small, the $Z^\prime$ then acts as a {\it ``reheaton’’}, dominating the energy budget of the Universe before finally yielding the SM bath, with reheating temperature $&lt; O(10)$ TeV, through the gauge portal interaction. We explore the possibility that DM freezes-in via non-thermal $Z^\prime$ decays before reheating ends, giving rise to substantial viable parameter space. We account for non-perturbative effects, relevant during the initial stages of reheating, using lattice simulations. We additionally show how the cosmological gravitational wave (GW) background produced by preheating and inflation allow for a direct probe of the reheating mechanism.</p>

<p>2025-11-04, <strong>Observational tests of the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina cosmological model</strong>, Himanshu Chaudhary et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02729v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.02729v2</a></p>

<p>We consider detailed cosmological tests of dark energy models obtained from the general conformal transformation of the Kropina metric, representing an $(\alpha,\beta)$-type Finslerian geometry. In particular, we restrict our analysis to the osculating Barthel-Kropina geometry. The Kropina metric function is defined as the ratio of the square of a Riemannian metric $\alpha$ and of the one-form $\beta$. In this framework we also consider the role of the conformal transformations of the metric, which allows to introduce a family of conformal Barthel-Kropina theories in an osculating geometry. The models obtained in this way are described by second order field equations, in the presence of an effective scalar field induced by the conformal factor. The generalized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the Riemannian metric $\alpha$ the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker representation. In order to close the cosmological field equations we assume a specific relationship between the component of the one-form $\beta$ and the conformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is determined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free parameter $\gamma$ of the model. The conformal Barthel-Kropina cosmological models are compared against several observational datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which allows the determination of $\gamma$. A comparison with the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM model is also performed. Our results indicate that the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina model can be considered as a successful, and simple, alternative to standard cosmological models.</p>

<p>2025-11-04, <strong>Supernova Classification using the Recurrent Neural Network in the CSST Ultra-Deep Field Survey</strong>, Minglin Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02631v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.02631v1</a></p>

<p>We study supernova (SN) classification using the machine learning method of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope Ultra-Deep Field (CSST-UDF) photometric survey, and explore the improvement of the cosmological constraint. We generate the mock light curve data of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) and core collapse supernova (CCSN) using SNCosmo with SALT3 SN Ia model and CCSN templates, and apply the SuperNNova (SNN) program for classifying SNe. Our study indicates that the SNN combined with the Joint Light-curve Analysis like (JLA-like) cuts can enhance the purity of the CSST-UDF SN Ia sample up to over 99.5% with 2,193 SNe Ia and 4 CCSNe, which can significantly increase the reliability of the cosmological constraint results. The method based on the Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species (BEAMS) with Bias Corrections (BBC) framework is used to correct the SN Ia magnitude bias caused by the selection effect and CCSN contamination, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed for cosmological constraints. We find that the accuracy of the constraints on the matter density $\Omega_{\rm M}$ and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ can achieve 14% and 18%, respectively, assuming the flat $w$CDM model. This result is comparable to that from the current surveys that relied on spectroscopic confirmation. It indicates that our data analysis method is effective, and the CSST-UDF SN photometric survey is powerful in exploring the expansion history of the Universe.</p>

<p>2025-11-04, <strong>Polarization-controlled pattern formation in antiparallel dipolar binary condensates</strong>, Zhijun Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02516v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.02516v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate non-equilibrium pattern formation in an antiparallel two-component dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate by varying the polarization angle and the trap aspect ratio. At finite tilt, the condensate supports stripe order. Quenching the angle to zero triggers a roton-assisted, mushroom-like corrugation that destroys translational order and drives the system into labyrinthine textures, whereas a slow linear ramp produces long-lived curved stripes that ultimately converge to labyrinths. Population imbalance strongly biases the evolution: the minority component preferentially fragments into a stable droplet array while the majority remains comparatively diffuse; once formed, the droplet crystal is robust under polarization hysteresis with largely reversible shape changes and unchanged lattice topology. The trap aspect ratio controls both the initial stripe number and the instability timescale, with tighter axial confinement accelerating corrugation and yielding denser labyrinths at late times. All behaviors arise within a quasi-two-dimensional mean-field regime where beyond-mean-field corrections are negligible; accordingly, the droplets reported here are not self-bound in free space. The observed textures (such as stripes, curved stripes, and labyrinths) mirror the taxonomy and instability pathways of nuclear “pasta” morphologies (rods and slabs) known from neutron-star and supernova matter, highlighting polarization angle, trap geometry, and population imbalance as practical, experimentally accessible controls for selecting and steering patterns in dipolar mixtures.</p>

<p>2025-11-04, <strong>An Extremely Luminous Flare Recorded from a Supermassive Black Hole</strong>, Matthew J. Graham et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02178v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2511.02178v1</a></p>

<p>Since their discovery more than 60 years ago, accreting supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) were recognized as highly variable sources, requiring an extremely compact, dynamic environment. Their variability traces to multiple phenomena, including changing accretion rates, temperature changes, foreground absorbers, and structural changes to the accretion disk. Spurred by a new generation of time-domain surveys, the extremes of black hole variability are now being probed. We report the discovery of an extreme flare by the AGN J224554.84+374326.5, which brightened by more than a factor of 40 in 2018. The source has slowly faded since then. The total emitted UV/optical energy to date is $\sim10^{54}$ erg, i.e., the complete conversion of approximately one solar mass into electromagnetic radiation. This flare is 30 times more powerful than the previous most powerful AGN transient. Very few physical events in the Universe can liberate this much electromagnetic energy. We discuss potential mechanisms, including the tidal disruption of a high mass $(&gt;30\, M_\odot)$ star, gravitational lensing of an AGN flare or supernova, or a supermassive (pair instability) supernova in the accretion disk of an AGN. We favor the tidal disruption of a massive star in a prograde orbit in an AGN disk.</p>
