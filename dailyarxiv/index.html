<p>2023-11-29, <strong>Supernovae in 2023 (review): breakthroughs by late observations</strong>, Noam Soker et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17732v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.17732v1</a></p>

<p>I present a review of how late observations of supernovae, of the nebular phase, and much later of supernova remnants (SNRs), and their analysis in 2023 made progress towards breakthroughs in supporting the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and in introducing the group of lonely white dwarf (WD) scenarios for type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The new analyses of CCSN remnants (CCSNRs) reveal point-symmetric morphologies in a way unnoticed before in three CCSNRs. Comparison to multipolar planetary nebulae that are shaped by jets suggests that jets exploded these CCSNe, as predicted by the JJEM, but incompatible with the prediction of the delayed neutrino explosion mechanism. The spherical morphology of the ejecta Pa 30 of the historical type Iax supernova (SN Iax) of 1181 AD, which studies in 2023 revealed, is mostly compatible with the explosion of a lonely WD. Namely, at the explosion time, there is only a WD, without any close companion, although the WD was formed via a close binary interaction, i.e., binary merger. An identification of point-symmetry in SNR G1.9+0.3, a normal SN Ia and the youngest SN in the Galaxy, suggests an SN explosion of a lonely WD inside a planetary nebula (an SNIP). The group of lonely WD scenarios includes the core degenerate scenario and the double degenerate scenario with a merger to explosion delay (MED) time. SN Ia explosions of lonely WDs are common, and might actually account for most (or even all) normal SNe Ia.</p>

<p>2023-11-29, <strong>A neutrino floor for the Migdal effect</strong>, Gonzalo Herrera et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17719v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.17719v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino-nucleus scatterings in the detector could induce electron ionization signatures due to the Migdal effect. We derive prospects for a future detection of the Migdal effect via coherent elastic solar neutrino-nucleus scatterings in liquid xenon detectors, and discuss the irreducible background that it constitutes for the Migdal effect caused by light dark matter-nucleus scatterings. Furthermore, we explore the ionization signal induced by some neutrino electromagnetic and non-standard interactions on nuclei. In certain scenarios, we find a distinct peak on the ionization spectrum of xenon around 0.1 keV, in clear contrast to the Standard Model expectation.</p>

<p>2023-11-29, <strong>Sagittarius $\mathrm{A}^{\star}$ as a plausible source candidate for PeV neutrinos</strong>, Sabyasachi Ray et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17642v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.17642v1</a></p>

<p>We propose that the recently observed diffuse neutrinos by IceCube with energies above 1 PeV might have originated from Sagittarius $\mathrm{A}^{\star}$ located in the galactic disk. This implies that the astrophysical settings of Sagittarius $\mathrm{A}^{\star}$ need to accelerate hadronic cosmic rays to energies of $\sim 100$ PeV or more. Then, the hadronic emission scenario argues that this galactic neutrino source is also a PeV gamma-ray source. Recent observation of galactic diffuse PeV gamma-rays with energies $\sim 1$ PeV by Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory has also advocated this conjecture. In the present paper, we demonstrate that if protons are accelerated to energies of $\sim 100$ PeV or more as reported by Osmanov {\it et al.} (Astrophys. J. {\bf 835} 164:2017) in Sagittarius $\mathrm{A}^{\star}$ environment, then they might generate PeV neutrinos and gamma rays through cosmic rays-gas/interstellar matter ({\it e.g.} $pp$) interactions. We estimate theoretically the diffuse neutrino flux due to back-to-back charged pion decays and the accompanying gamma-ray flux from neutral pion decays. These results suggest that a fraction ($\simeq 1\%$) of the PeV diffuse neutrino flux observed by IceCube can be explained by the neutrino emission from Sagittarius $\mathrm{A}^{\star}$. Upcoming IceCube Gen2 and Cherenkov telescope array could be able to test our scenario for PeV neutrino and gamma-ray emissions from the only known galactic Pevatron Sagittarius $\mathrm{A}^{\star}$ with CR energies more than $100$ PeV.</p>

<p>2023-11-29, <strong>From the gravitational waves to the exoplanets: the Research Highlights</strong>, Maria Giovanna Dainotti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17439v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.17439v1</a></p>

<p>In this Research Highlights, we summarize 31 contributions provided during the Workshop \textit{Multifrequency Behaviour of High Energy Cosmic Sources - XIV}, held in Palermo (Italy) from the 12th to the 17th of June 2023. We will start with the most recent discoveries in the field of gravitational waves (GWs). We will connect this topic to the contributions of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) associated with GWs and with the Kilonovae (KNe) hunting and, more in general, on GRBs. Continuing on high-energy astrophysics objects, we will delve into Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), neutrino astronomy and the study of the primordial universe, both from the space telescopesâ observation and from the very recent proposals in terms of cosmological models. From the faraway universe, we will move to the more local scales and discuss the recent observations in Supernova Remnants (SNRs), massive star binaries, globular cluster dynamics, and exoplanets observed by Kepler.</p>

<p>2023-11-29, <strong>Magnetic field simulations and measurements on the mini-ICAL detector</strong>, Honey Khindri et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17364v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.17364v1</a></p>

<p>The ICAL (Iron Calorimeter) is a 51 kTon magnetized detector proposed by the INO collaboration. It is designed to detect muons with energies in the 1-20 GeV range. A magnetic field of about 1.5 T in the ICAL detector will be generated by passing a DC current through suitable copper coils. This will enable it to distinguish between muons and anti-muons that will be generated from the interaction of atmospheric muon neutrinos and anti-neutrinos with iron. This will help in resolving the open question of mass ordering in the neutrino sector. Apart from charge identification, the magnetic field will be used to reconstruct the muon momentum (direction and magnitude). Therefore it is important to know the magnetic field in the detector as accurately as possible. We present here an (indirect) measurement of the magnetic field in the 85 ton prototype mini-ICAL detector working in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, for different coil currents. A detailed 3-D finite element simulation was done for the mini-ICAL geometry using Infolytica MagNet software and the magnetic field was computed for different coil currents. This paper presents, for the first time, a comparison of the magnetic field measured in the air gaps with the simulated magnetic field, to validate the simulation using real time data. Using the simulations the magnetic field inside the iron is estimated.</p>

<p>2023-11-29, <strong>The Design and Technology Development of the JUNO Central Detector</strong>, The JUNO Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17314v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.17314v1</a></p>

<p>The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a large scale neutrino experiment with multiple physics goals including deter mining the neutrino mass hierarchy, the accurate measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters, the neutrino detection from the super nova, the Sun, and the Earth, etc. JUNO puts forward physically and technologically stringent requirements for its central detector (CD), including a large volume and target mass (20 kt liquid scintillator, LS), a high energy resolution (3% at 1 MeV), a high light transmittance, the largest possible photomultiplier (PMT) coverage, the lowest possible radioactive background, etc. The CD design, using a spherical acrylic vessel with a diameter of 35.4 m to contain the LS and a stainless steel structure to support the acrylic vessel and PMTs, was chosen and optimized. The acrylic vessel and the stainless steel structure will be immersed in pure water to shield the radioactive back ground and bear great buoyancy. The challenging requirements of the acrylic sphere have been achieved, such as a low intrinsic radioactivity and high transmittance of the manufactured acrylic panels, the tensile and compressive acrylic node design with embedded stainless steel pad, one-time polymerization for multiple bonding lines. Moreover, several technical challenges of the stainless steel structure have been solved: the production of low radioactivity stainless steel material, the deformation and precision control during production and assembly, the usage of high strength stainless steel rivet bolt and of high friction efficient linkage plate. Finally, the design of the ancillary equipment like the LS filling, overflowing and circulating system was done.</p>

<p>2023-11-29, <strong>A Robust Search for Lepton Flavour Violating Axions at Mu3e</strong>, Simon Knapen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17915v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.17915v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a search at Mu3e for lepton flavor violating axion(-like) particles in $\mu\to 3e + a$ decays. By requiring an additional $e^+e^-$ pair from internal conversion, one can circumvent the calibration challenges which plague the $\mu \to e+a$ channel for axions lighter than 20 MeV. Crucially, the corresponding reduction in signal rate is to a large extent compensated for by Mu3eâs ability to resolve highly collimated tracks. For phase I of Mu3e, we project a sensitivity to decay constants as high as $6\times 10^9$ GeV which probes uncharted parameter space in scenarios of axion dark matter. The sensitivity to axions which couple primarily to right-handed leptons can be further improved by leveraging the polarisation of the muon beam.</p>

<p>2023-11-29, <strong>Co-Existence Test of Primordial Black Holes and Particle Dark Matter</strong>, Han Gil Choi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17829v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.17829v1</a></p>

<p>If dark matter (DM) consists of primordial black holes (PBHs) and particles simultaneously, PBHs are generically embedded within particle DM halos. Such âdressed PBHsâ (dPBHs) are not subject to typical PBH constraints and can explain the DM abundance in the mass range $10^{-1} \sim 10^2 M_\odot$. We show that diffractive lensing of chirping gravitational waves (GWs) from binary mergers can not only discover, but can also identify dPBH lenses and discriminate them from bare PBHs on the event-by-event basis, with potential to uniquely establish the co-existence of subdominant PBHs and particle DM.</p>

<p>2023-11-29, <strong>Constraining Gamma-ray Lines from Dark Matter Annihilation using Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. data</strong>, Lucia Angel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17827v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.17827v1</a></p>

<p>Using 14 years of Fermi-LAT data and 10 years of H.E.S.S. observations in the direction of the galactic center, we derive limits on gamma-ray lines originated from dark matter annihilations for fermionic and scalar fields. We describe the dark matter annihilation into $\gamma \gamma$ or $\gamma Z$ final states in terms of effective operators and place limits on the energy scale as a function of the dark matter mass taking into account the energy resolution of the instruments. For the Fermi-LAT data, we considered an NFW and a contracted NFW dark matter density profile, the latter being preferred by the Fermi GeV excess. For the H.E.S.S. observation, we used an NFW and Einasto profile. Fermi-LAT yields the most stringent constraints for dark matter masses below 300 GeV, whereas H.E.S.S. has the strongest ones for dark matter masses above 1 TeV. The telescopes share similar sensitivities for dark matter masses between 300 GeV and 1 TeV. We conclude that Fermi-LAT (H.E.S.S.) can probe energy scales up to $10(20)$~TeV for scalar and fermionic dark matter particles.</p>

<p>2023-11-29, <strong>Primordial Black Holes and induced gravitational waves from a smooth crossover beyond Standard Model</strong>, Albert EscrivÃ  et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17760v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.17760v1</a></p>

<p>Gravitational waves (GWs) induced by primordial fluctuations can be affected by the modification of the sound speed $c^2_{\rm s}$ and the equation of state parameter $w$ once the curvature fluctuations reenter the cosmological horizon. We consider a hypothetical softening of $w$ and $c^2_{\rm s}$ caused by a smooth crossover beyond Standard Model theories, for what we numerically compute the secondary induced GW considering the case of a flat scale-invariant power spectrum. We find that if the amplitude of the power spectrum is sufficiently large, the characteristic feature of the GW signal caused by the smooth crossover can be detected by future spaced-based gravitational wave interferometers and differentiated from the pure radiation case. At the same time, depending on the mass scale where the crossover occurs, such a scenario can have compatibility with primordial black holes being all the dark matter when $\mathcal{A} \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, with a mass function very sharply peaked around the horizon mass scale of the minimum of the sound speed.</p>

<p>2023-11-29, <strong>Generation of Isocurvature from Curvature Inhomogeneities on Super-Horizon Scales</strong>, Albert Stebbins et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17379v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.17379v1</a></p>

<p>Here it is shown 1) how isocurvature inhomogeneities correlated on causally disconnected (super-horizon) scales are generated from curvature inhomogeneities which are known to be correlated on these scales 2) that super-horizon isocurvature generation is nearly inevitable for non-equilibrium chemical processes 3) that the amplitude of the compositional isocurvature correlations a) can be large for production of rare objects, b) falls off rapidly with separation c) falls off at scales below the horizon when these modes are generated. These two fall-offs results in an âisocurvature bumpâ in the power spectrum. Isocurvature generation is illustrated by the process of dark matter freeze-in, computed here with both separate universe modelling and linear perturbation theory. For freeze-in the most prominent isocurvature modes are inhomogeneities in the ratio of dark matter to standard model matter. Much smaller inhomogeneities in the ratio of baryons to standard model entropy are also produced. Previous constraints on freeze-in from Ly-$\alpha$ clouds limit the bump enhancement to $\lesssim10\%$ on comoving scales $\lesssim1\,$Mpc. Current observations are not sensitive to the isocurvature modes generated in viable freeze-in models. Results are obtained using a somewhat novel framework to describe cosmological inhomogeneities.</p>

<p>2023-11-29, <strong>Axion minicluster streams in the solar neighbourhood</strong>, Ciaran A. J. OâHare et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17367v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.17367v1</a></p>

<p>A consequence of QCD axion dark matter being born after inflation is the emergence of ultra-small-scale substructures known as miniclusters. Although miniclusters merge to form minihalos, this intrinsic granularity is expected to remain imprinted on small scales in our galaxy, leading to potentially damning consequences for the campaign to detect axions directly on Earth. This picture, however, is modified when one takes into account the fact that encounters with stars will tidally strip mass from the miniclusters, creating pc-long tidal streams that act to refill the dark matter distribution. Here we ask whether or not this stripping rescues experimental prospects from the worst-case scenario in which the majority of axions remain bound up in unobservably small miniclusters. We find that the density sampled by the Earth on mpc-scales will be, on average, around 70-90% of the known local DM density, and at a typical point in the solar neighbourhood, we expect most of the dark matter to be comprised of debris from $\mathcal{O}(10^2$-$10^3)$ overlapping streams. If haloscopes can measure the axion signal with high-enough frequency resolution, then these streams are revealed in the form of an intrinsically spiky lineshape, in stark contrast with the standard assumption of a smooth, featureless Maxwellian distribution â a unique prediction that constitutes a way for experiments to distinguish between pre and post-inflationary axion cosmologies.</p>

<p>2023-11-29, <strong>Number count of Gravitational Waves and Supernovae in Luminosity Distance space for LCDM and Scalar-Tensor theories</strong>, Anna Balaudo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17904v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.17904v1</a></p>

<p>The clustering of gravitational waves in luminosity distance space is emerging as a promising probe of the growth of structure. Just like for galaxies, its osbervation is subject to a number of relativistic corrections that affect the measured signal and need to be accounted for when fitting theoretical models to the data. We derive the full expression for the number count of gravitational waves in luminosity distance space, including all relativistic corrections, in LCDM and in scalar-tensor theories with luminal propagation of tensors. We investigate the importance of each relativistic effect and the detectability of the total signal by current and planned GW detectors. We consider also supernovae in luminosity distance space, highlighting the differences with gravitational waves in the case of scalar-tensor theories. We carry out a thorough comparison among the number count of gravitational waves and supernovae in luminosity distance space, and that of galaxies in redshift space. We show how the relativistic corrections contain useful complementary information on the growth of perturbations and on the underlying theory of gravity, highlighting the synergy with other cosmological probes.</p>

<p>2023-11-29, <strong>The Common Envelope Evolution Outcome. II. Short Orbital Period Hot Subdwarf B Binaries Reveal a Clear Picture</strong>, Hongwei Ge et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17304v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.17304v1</a></p>

<p>The common envelope evolution (CEE) is vital in forming short orbital period compact binaries. It covers many objects, such as double compact merging binaries, type Ia supernovae progenitors, binary pulsars, and X-ray binaries. Knowledge about the common envelope (CE) eject efficiency still needs to be improved, though progress has been made recently. Short orbital period hot subdwarf B star plus white dwarf binaries are the most straightforward samples to constrain CEE physics. We apply the known orbital period-white dwarf relation to constrain the sdB progenitor of seven sdB+WD binaries with a known inclination angle. The average value of the CE efficiency parameter is 0.32, which is consistent with previous studies. However, the CE efficiency might not be a constant but is a function of the initial mass ratio based on well-constrained sdB progenitor mass and evolutionary stage. Our results can be used as physical inputs for binary population synthesis simulations on related objects. A similar method can also be applied to study other short orbital period WD binaries.</p>
