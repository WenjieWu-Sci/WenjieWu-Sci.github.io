<p>2025-03-24, <strong>Role of the $δ$ Meson in the Equation of State an Direct Urca Cooling of Neutron Stars</strong>, Luigi Scurto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18889v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.18889v1</a></p>

<p>The direct Urca (dUrca) process is a key mechanism driving rapid neutrino cooling in neutron stars, with its baryon density activation threshold determined by the microscopic model for nuclear matter. Understanding how nuclear interactions shape the dUrca threshold is essential for interpreting neutron star thermal evolution, particularly in light of recent studies on exceptionally cold objects. We investigate the impact of incorporating the scalar isovector $\delta$ meson into the neutron star equation of state, which alters the internal proton fraction and consequently affects the dUrca cooling threshold. Since proton superfluidity is known to suppress dUrca rates, we also examine the interplay between the nuclear interaction mediated by the $\delta$ meson and the $^1S_0$ proton pairing gap. We perform a Bayesian analysis using models built within a relativistic mean-field approximation, incorporating constraints from astrophysical observations, nuclear experiments, and known results of \textit{ab initio} calculations of pure neutron matter. We then impose a constraint on the dUrca threshold based on studies of fast-cooling neutron stars. The inclusion of $\delta$ meson expands the range of possible internal compositions, directly influencing the stellar mass required for the central density to reach the dUrca threshold. Furthermore, we observe that the observation of relatively young and cold neutron stars provides insights into $^1S_0$ proton superfluidity in the core of neutron stars.</p>

<p>2025-03-24, <strong>Dark matter induced by neutrino mixing and flavor vacuum condensate probed by neutrino capture on tritium</strong>, Antonio Capolupo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18776v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.18776v1</a></p>

<p>We show that experiments designed to capture low energy neutrinos, like PTOLEMY are sensitive to the specific neutrino model. In particular, they might show a signature of the condensed flavor vacuum, featured in the flavor Fock space model, and allow to test the hypothesis according to which a possible dark matter component is determined by neutrino mixing.</p>

<p>2025-03-24, <strong>Scale and redshift dependent limits on cosmic neutrino properties</strong>, Deng Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18745v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.18745v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmological neutrino mass and abundance measurements are reaching unprecedented precision. Testing their stability versus redshift and scale is a crucial issue, as it can serve as a guide for optimizing ongoing and future searches. Here, we perform such analyses, considering a number of redshift, scale, and redshift-and-scale nodes. Concerning the $k$-space analysis of $\sum m_\nu$, CMB observations are crucial, as they lead the neutrino mass constraints. Interestingly, some data combinations suggest a non-zero value for the neutrino mass with $2\sigma$ significance. The most constraining bound we find is $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.54$ eV at $95\%$ CL in the $[10^{-3}, 10^{-2}]$ $h$/Mpc $k$-bin, a limit that barely depends on the data combination. Regarding the redshift- and scale-dependent neutrino mass constraints, high redshifts ($z&gt;100$) and scales in the range $[10^{-3}, 10^{-1}]$ $h$/Mpc provide the best constraints. The least constraining bounds are obtained at very low redshifts $[0,0.5]$ and also at very small scales ($k&gt;0.1\, h$/Mpc), due to the absence of observations. Highly relevant is the case of the $[100, 1100]$, $[10^{-2}, 10^{-1}]$ $h$/Mpc redshift-scale bin, where a $2$-$3\sigma$ evidence for a non-zero neutrino mass is obtained for all data combinations. The bound from CMB alone at $68\%$ CL is $0.63^{+0.20}_{-0.24}$ eV, and the one for the full dataset is $0.56^{+0.20}_{-0.23}$ eV, clearly suggesting a non-zero neutrino mass at these scales, possibly related to a deviation of the ISW amplitude in this redshift range. Concerning the analysis of $N_{\rm eff}$ in the $k$-space, at intermediate scales ranging from $k=10^{-3}$ $h$/Mpc to $k=10^{-1}$ $h$/Mpc, accurate CMB data provide very strong bounds, the most robust one being $N_{\rm eff}=3.09\pm 0.14$, comparable to the standard expected value without a $k$-bin analysis.

<p>2025-03-24, <strong>Superheavy Supersymmetric Dark Matter for the origin of KM3NeT Ultra-High Energy signal</strong>, Yongsoo Jho et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18737v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.18737v1</a></p>

<p>We propose an explanation for the recently reported ultra-high-energy neutrino signal at KM3NeT, which lacks an identifiable astrophysical source. While decaying dark matter in the Galactic Center is a natural candidate, the observed arrival direction strongly suggests an extragalactic origin. We introduce a multicomponent dark matter scenario in which the components are part of a supermultiplet, with supersymmetry ensuring a nearly degenerate mass spectrum among the fields. This setup allows a heavy component to decay into a lighter one, producing a boosted neutrino spectrum with energy $E_\nu \sim 100$ PeV, determined by the mass difference. The heavy-to-light decay occurs at a cosmological redshift of $z \sim \text{a few}$ or higher, leading to an isotropic directional distribution of the signal.</p>

<p>2025-03-24, <strong>Sterile-neutrino search based on 259 days of KATRIN data</strong>, Himal Acharya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18667v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.18667v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinos are the most abundant fundamental matter particles in the Universe and play a crucial role in particle physics and cosmology. Neutrino oscillation, discovered about 25 years ago, reveals that the three known species mix with each other. Anomalous results from reactor and radioactive-source experiments suggest a possible fourth neutrino state, the sterile neutrino, which does not interact via the weak force. The KATRIN experiment, primarily designed to measure the neutrino mass via tritium $\beta$-decay, also searches for sterile neutrinos suggested by these anomalies. A sterile-neutrino signal would appear as a distortion in the $\beta$-decay energy spectrum, characterized by a discontinuity in curvature (kink) related to the sterile-neutrino mass. This signature, which depends only on the shape of the spectrum rather than its absolute normalization, offers a robust, complementary approach to reactor experiments. KATRIN examined the energy spectrum of 36 million tritium $\beta$-decay electrons recorded in 259 measurement days within the last 40 electronvolt below the endpoint. The results exclude a substantial part of the parameter space suggested by the gallium anomaly and challenge the Neutrino-4 claim. Together with other neutrino-disappearance experiments, KATRIN probes sterile-to-active mass splittings from a fraction of an electron-volt squared to several hundred electron-volts squared, excluding light sterile neutrinos with mixing angles above a few percent.</p>

<p>2025-03-24, <strong>Constraints on $ΔL=2$ Vector Bosons with Tree Couplings to SM Particles</strong>, Zhong-Lv Huang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18591v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.18591v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate phenomenological implications of vector bosons $V$ transforming as (1, 2, -3/2) under the standard model (SM) product gauge group $SU(3)_C$, $SU(2)_L$ and $U(1)_Y$. These vector bosons can couple to two SM leptons at tree-level forming dimension-4 operators. These operators dictate $V$ to have two units of global lepton number, $\Delta L = 2$. The operators generated conserve the global lepton number but can violate generational lepton numbers. We study constraints on the couplings $Y$ of $V$ to SM particles using tree-level processes such as $l_\alpha^{-} \to l_\beta^{+} l_\rho^{-} l_\sigma^{-}$, muonium and antimuonium oscillation, neutrino trident scattering, $e^- e^+ \to l^- l^+$, and also one-loop level processes such as the anomalous $g-2$ of a charged lepton and $l_i \to l_j \gamma$. Strong constraints are obtained from $l_\alpha^{-} \to l_\beta^{+} l_\rho^{-} l_\sigma^{-}$ with $\left|Y_{e e} Y^{<em>}_{\mu e}\right| &lt; 3.29 \times 10^{-11}\left(m_{V}/ \mathrm{GeV}\right)^{2},\left|Y_{e e} Y^{</em>}_{e \mu}\right| &lt; 3.29 \times 10^{-11}\left(m_{V}/ \mathrm{GeV}\right)^{2}$ and from $l_i \to l_j \gamma$ with $ \left|Y_{\tau e}Y_{\mu\tau}^{<em>}\right|&lt;3.46\times10^{-12}(m_{V}/ \mathrm{GeV})^2, \left|Y_{e \tau}Y_{\tau \mu}^{</em>}\right|&lt;3.46\times10^{-12}\left(m_{V}/ \mathrm{GeV}\right)^2$, respectively. The constraints obtained from other processes considered are much weaker.</p>

<p>2025-03-24, <strong>Geometric properties versus particle motion in the Fang-Wang spacetime</strong>, Gulnara Suliyeva et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18380v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.18380v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we explore general relativistic effects and geometric properties of the Fan-Wang spacetime, one of the simplest regular solutions that can be obtained in nonlinear electrodynamics. In particular, we investigate the motion of test particles, the capture cross-section of neutral massive and massless particles, such as neutrinos and photons, and the gravitational redshift. Additionally, using a perturbative approach, we derive analytical expressions for the perihelion shift and gravitational deflection of massless particles. By identifying the one-parameter corrections to the Schwarzschild spacetime, induced by the magnetic charge contained in the Fang-Wang metric, we show that this spacetime can be falsified, since it modifies classical general relativity predictions even at the local level. Moreover, we argue that these modifications could be experimentally tested with advanced observational instrumentation.</p>

<p>2025-03-24, <strong>Magneto-$ν$: Heavy neutral lepton search using $^{241}$Pu $β^-$ decays</strong>, C. Lee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18350v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.18350v1</a></p>

<p>We present experimental beta spectra of $^{241}$Pu as part of the Magneto-$\nu$ experiment aimed at searching for keV heavy neutral leptons (HNLs). Total 200 million beta decays are measured by metallic magnetic calorimeters (MMCs), representing the highest statistical precision achieved for $^{241}$Pu to date. The end-point energy of $^{241}$Pu beta decay is measured via in-situ alpha calibration, yielding a value of 21.52(2) keV. The differential decay rate of the first forbidden non-unique transition of $^{241}$Pu is described with a quadratic shape correction factor $C(w) = 1 - 1.931w + 0.940w^2$. Using these high-statistics spectra, we set an upper limit on the admixture of a 10.5\,keV sterile neutrino to the electron neutrino at $|U_{e4}|^2 &lt; 2 \times 10^{-3}$ for HNL mass of 10.5\,keV.</p>

<p>2025-03-24, <strong>Warm Inflation with the Standard Model</strong>, Kim V. Berghaus et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18829v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.18829v1</a></p>

<p>We show for the first time that warm inflation is feasible with Standard Model (SM) gauge interactions alone. Our model consists of a minimal extension of the SM by a single scalar inflaton field with an axion-like coupling to gluons and a monomial potential. The effects of light fermions, which were previously argued to render warm inflation with the SM impossible, are alleviated by Hubble dilution of their chiral chemical potentials. Our model only features one adjustable combination of parameters and accommodates all inflationary observables. We briefly discuss implications for axion experiments, dark matter, and the strong CP-problem.</p>

<p>2025-03-24, <strong>No-scale Brans-Dicke Gravity – ultralight scalar boson &amp; heavy inflaton</strong>, Muzi Hong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18648v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.18648v1</a></p>

<p>It is very much intriguing if the Planck scale $M_{\rm{Pl}}$ is not a fundamental parameter. The Brans-Dicke gravity is nothing but the theory where the Planck scale $M_{\rm{Pl}}$ is indeed an illusional parameter. The theory predicts a massless scalar boson whose exchanges between matters induce unwanted long range forces. We solve this problem imposing there is no dimensionful parameter in the theory, even at the quantum level. We further extend the theory by including a $R^2$ term and a non-minimal coupling of the Standard Model Higgs to gravity, as their coefficients are dimensionless. This extension provides a heavy inflaton field that is consistent with all cosmological observations, with a potential very similar to that of the Starobinsky model. The inflaton necessarily decays into the massless scalar bosons, resulting in a non-negligible amount of dark radiation in the present universe. We demonstrate that the inflation model yields a sufficiently high reheating temperature for successful leptogenesis, and we also discuss a possible candidate for dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-03-24, <strong>Dark Matter and Collider Phenomenology in Radiative Type-III Seesaw Model with Two Inert Doublets</strong>, Tapender et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18566v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.18566v2</a></p>

<p>We investigate a minimal Type-III scotogenic model featuring two inert scalar doublets and a hyperchargeless triplet fermion. The scalar sector, in addition to the Standard Model Higgs, includes a rich spectrum of dark scalars comprising two CP-even, two CP-odd, and two charged states. This framework gives rise to two viable dark matter candidates: the lightest CP-even dark scalar and the neutral component of the triplet fermion. We perform a comprehensive analysis of both dark matter scenarios, carefully examining their viability under the umbrella of theoretical consistency conditions and experimental constraints. Beyond the conventional collider signatures anticipated in the Type-III scotogenic model with a single inert doublet, our extended framework predicts distinctive and novel signatures.</p>

<p>2025-03-24, <strong>Accretion in very early Universe and charge asymmetry</strong>, N. A. Pozdnyakov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18416v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.18416v1</a></p>

<p>Additional elementary species and primordial black holes are common candidates for dark matter. Their co-existence in the early Universe leads to accretion if particles are heavy. We solve equation of motion affected by expansion which enhances black hole growth rates. They depend upon particles freeze-out time rather than their mass. Taking into account friction we investigate recently suggested baryogenesis mechanism operating via scattering cross-section difference between particles and antiparticles on relativistic symmetric plasma. We find that asymmetry is accumulated at relatively small times which can be used to construct viable particle models.</p>

<p>2025-03-24, <strong>Scalable architecture for dark photon searches: Superconducting-qubit proof of principle</strong>, Runqi Kang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18315v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.18315v1</a></p>

<p>The dark photon is a well-motivated candidate of dark matter due to its potential to open the window of new physics beyond the Standard Model. A fundamental mass-range-sensitivity dilemma is always haunting the dark photon searching experiments: The resonant haloscopes have excellent sensitivity but are narrowband, and vice versa for the non-resonant ones. A scalable architecture integrating numerous resonant haloscopes will be a desirable solution to this dilemma. However, even the concept of scalable searching remains rarely explored, due to the size limitation of conventional haloscopes imposed by the dark photon wavelength. Here we propose and demonstrate a novel architecture using superconducting qubits as sub-wavelength haloscope units. By virtue of the scalability of superconducting qubits, it is possible to integrate multiple qubits with different frequencies on a chip-scale device. Furthermore, the frequencies of the qubits can be tuned to extend the searching mass range. Thus, our architectures allow for searching for dark photons in a broad mass range with high sensitivity. As a proof-of-principle experiment, we designed and fabricated a three-qubit chip and successfully demonstrated a scalable dark-photon searching. Our work established constraints on dark photons in the mass range of 15.632 $\mu$eV$\sim$15.638 $\mu$eV, 15.838 $\mu$eV$\sim$15.845 $\mu$eV, and 16.463 $\mu$eV$\sim$16.468 $\mu$eV, simultaneously, and the constraints are much more stringent than the cosmology constraints. Our work can be scaled up in the future to boost the scrutiny of new physics and extended to search for more dark matter candidates, including dark photons, axions and axion-like particles.</p>

<p>2025-03-24, <strong>Interpreting Cosmic Birefringence and DESI Data with Evolving Axion in $Λ$CDM</strong>, Shota Nakagawa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18924v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.18924v1</a></p>

<p>Recent cosmological observations have revealed growing tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, including indications of isotropic cosmic birefringence and deviations from $w = -1$ in the dark energy equation of state, as suggested by DESI and supernova measurements. In this paper, we point out that such deviations can arise even from a subdominant energy density component. We then propose a unified framework based on a dynamical axion field that simultaneously accounts for both anomalies, providing a simple and natural extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In our scenario, the axion field with $2H_0\lesssim m\lesssim 6H_0$, where $H_0$ is the current Hubble constant, induces a nonzero rotation of the CMB polarization plane and modifies the present-day dark energy equation of state. This framework accommodates recent observational data with natural parameter choices, even for a string axion with a decay constant of order $10^{17}\,$GeV.</p>
