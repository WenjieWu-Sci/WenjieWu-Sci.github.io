<p>2026-01-22, <strong>The FarView Low Frequency Radio Array on the Moon’s Far Side: Science and Array Architecture</strong>, Jack O. Burns et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16170v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.16170v1</a></p>

<p>FarView is a proposed low frequency radio interferometer for deployment on the lunar far side, enabled by the Moon’s radio quiet environment. Operating over 1-50 MHz inaccessible from Earth, FarView will open a new observational window and promote discovery class science in cosmology, heliophysics, Galactic and exoplanet astrophysics. The primary science is measurement of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the Cosmic Dark Ages (z=30-100), identified by the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as a priority cosmology discovery area. FarView will deliver 3D tomographic measurements and precision power spectra of neutral hydrogen in a largely linear regime, enabling tests of inflationary initial conditions, primordial non Gaussianity, dark matter properties, neutrino masses, and early dark energy. The reference design consists of 100000 crossed dipole antennas in a dense core-halo configuration spanning 200 sq km. A compact 4 km core with 83000 dipoles maximizes sensitivity to large scale cosmological modes, while 20000 halo elements extending to 14 km provide angular resolution and calibration for foreground characterization. Sensitivity forecasts indicate a 10-sigma detection of the Dark Ages 21 cm power spectrum at z=30 over five years of half duty cycle lunar night observations. An FFT-based EPIC beamformer is identified as an efficient signal processing architecture. Beyond cosmology, FarView will enable interferometric imaging of low frequency solar radio bursts, advancing space weather studies. Additional capabilities include stellar space weather observations, Galactic cosmic ray tomography via free-free absorption, and searches for auroral radio emission from exoplanet magnetospheres, a probe of exoplanet habitability. FarView represents a flagship class opportunity to establish the Moon as a platform for foundational astrophysics while delivering unique observational capabilities.</p>

<p>2026-01-22, <strong>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 4. Percent-Level Cosmological Constraints from Combined Probes and Robust Evidence for the Normal Neutrino Mass Hierarchy</strong>, Mikhail M. Ivanov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16165v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.16165v1</a></p>

<p>We present cosmological parameters measurements from the full combination of DESI DR1 galaxy clustering data described with large-scale structure effective field theory. By incorporating additional datasets (photometric galaxies and CMB lensing cross-correlations) and extending the bispectrum likelihood to smaller scales using a consistent one-loop theory computation, we achieve substantial gains in constraining power relative to previous analyses. Combining with the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data and using cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors on the power spectrum tilt and baryon density, we obtain tight constraints on the $Λ$CDM model, finding the Hubble constant $H_0=69.08\pm 0.37~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, the matter density fraction $Ω_m=0.2973\pm 0.0050$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $σ_8 = 0.815\pm 0.016$ (or the lensing parameter $S_8\equivσ_8\sqrt{Ω_m/0.3}=0.811\pm 0.016$), corresponding to $0.6\%$, $1.7\%$, and $2\%$ precision respectively. Adding the Pantheon+ supernova sample (SNe), we find a preference of $2.6σ$ for the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model from low-redshift data alone, which increases to $2.8σ$ when exchanging the SNe with Planck CMB data. Combining full-shape data with BAO, CMB, and SNe likelihoods, we improve the dark energy figure-of-merit by $18\%$ and bound the sum of the neutrino masses to $M_ν&lt;0.057$ eV in $Λ$CDM and $M_ν&lt;0.095$ eV in the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model (both at 95\% CL). This represents an improvement of $25\%$ over the background expansion constraints and the strongest bound on neutrino masses in $w_0w_a$CDM to date. Our results suggest that the preference for the normal ordering of neutrino mass states holds regardless of the cosmological background model, and is robust in light of tensions between cosmological datasets.</p>

<p>2026-01-22, <strong>Radiative corrections to decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson in the complex Higgs triplet model</strong>, Masashi Aiko et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15983v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.15983v1</a></p>

<p>The extension of the Higgs sector with an additional complex triplet field is often considered for generating the neutrino mass by the Type-II seesaw mechanism. Such an extension generally predicts $ρ\neq1$, where $ρ$ is the electroweak rho parameter at the tree level, so that the renormalization of the electroweak parameters is different from models like the standard model (SM) and two Higgs doublet models. In this paper, we present a full set of radiative corrections to decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson ($h$) in this model. One-loop contributions of the extra Higgs bosons as well as SM fermions and gauge bosons to the decay rates of $h$ are calculated in the on-shell scheme. Gauge dependence appearing in the counter terms of mixing angles is eliminated by the pinch technique. Higher-order QCD corrections are also implemented. We find that the decay rates can significantly deviate from the predictions in the SM and other extensions such as the two Higgs doublet models and the singlet model. For example, the decay rates of $h\to WW^\ast$ and $h\to ZZ^\ast$ can be a few percent larger than the SM value under current experimental and theoretical constraints. In this case, deviations in $h\to γγ$ and Higgs self-coupling can reach about $-20\%$ and $100\%$, respectively. The pattern of the deviations is different from the other extended Higgs models. These characteristic predictions are expected to be detected at the High-Luminosity LHC or future Higgs factories.</p>

<p>2026-01-22, <strong>Dominant Thermal Resonant Mechanism for Low-Scale Leptogenesis</strong>, Shao-Ping Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15921v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.15921v1</a></p>

<p>We explicitly demonstrate the importance of a new thermal resonant channel in the context of low-scale leptogenesis, which goes beyond the well-known mixing and oscillation of massive singlet neutrinos. This new channel is always present when considering the thermally-induced Higgs decay to leptons and relativistic sterile neutrinos, and can become dominant thanks to thermally-generated lepton-doublet flavour oscillations. This mechanism can yield the observed baryon asymmetry in our universe, even if there is no resonant enhancement from quasi-degenerate sterile neutrinos. The required active-to-sterile neutrino mixing differs from the other two low-scale leptogenesis channels and can be probed in fixed-target and long-lived particle experiments, and by displaced vertex searches at high-energy colliders.</p>

<p>2026-01-22, <strong>Neutrino-Induced Polarization Rotation in Active Galactic Nuclei Plasmas</strong>, H. B. Câmara et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15910v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.15910v1</a></p>

<p>We study parity-violating birefringence induced by an asymmetric neutrino background in plasmas associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN). We derive a directionality factor arising from the relative bulk motion between the neutrino medium and plasma, and show that it can produce an anomalous frequency dependence of the polarization-rotation angle, distinct from the $ω^{-2}$ scaling of Faraday rotation. This anomalous scaling can occur either at the resonance plasma frequency condition $ω\simeq ω_p$, or when $E_ν^{0}\simeq m_νω/ω_p$ lies within the range of the neutrino energy spectrum. We estimate the effect for three scenarios: jets propagating through the cosmic neutrino background (C$ν$B), jets with an internal flux of high-energy neutrinos, and accretion-disk plasma permeated by the C$ν$B. Of the three scenarios, the latter gives the largest rotation angle $φ_{\rm d} \sim 10^{-35}\,\mathrm{rad}$, at X-ray frequencies. Although the predicted rotation angles are below current polarimetric sensitivity, the identified spectral signatures provide a theoretical framework for probing neutrino asymmetries and AGN plasma properties independent of magnetic field models.</p>

<p>2026-01-22, <strong>WIMP Dark Matter from a Natural Discrete Gauge Symmetry in the Standard Model</strong>, Jie Sheng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15856v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.15856v1</a></p>

<p>The internal structure of the Standard Model implies a natural $\mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$ discrete gauge symmetry. Cancellation of the corresponding Dai–Freed anomalies requires the introduction of three right-handed neutrinos and three additional Majorana fermions $χ_i$. This gauge symmetry forbids the decay of the lightest fermion $χ_1$ into Standard Model particles, rendering it automatically stable and providing a dark matter candidate without introducing an ad hoc stabilizing symmetry and domain-wall problem. The mass of $χ_1$ is generated by the vacuum expectation value of a singlet scalar near the electroweak scale, naturally realizing a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) freeze-out scenario. Dark matter annihilation proceeds through scalar mediation, allowing the observed relic abundance to be reproduced while remaining consistent with current direct-detection constraints. It naturally realizes the secluded dark matter scenario and can be further tested in the next generation of experiments.</p>

<p>2026-01-22, <strong>The ESSnuSB-plus (ESSnuSB+) Project: Status and Prospects</strong>, George Fanourakis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15826v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.15826v1</a></p>

<p>The ESSnuSB is a design study for a long-baseline neutrino experiment to precisely measure the CP violation in the leptonic sector, at the second neutrino oscillation maximum, using a beam driven by the uniquely powerful ESS linear accelerator. The ESSnuSB-plus (ESSnuSB+) design study program, which is an extension phase of the ESSnuSB project, aims in designing two new facilities, a Low Energy nuSTORM and a Low Energy Monitored Neutrino Beam and use them to precisely measure the (anti)neutrino-nucleus cross-section in the energy range of 200-600 MeV, where experimental data are lacking or imprecise. In addition, new target stations and a new water-Cherenkov near-near detector will be designed to measure cross sections and serve to explore sterile neutrino physics. An overall status of the project will be presented together with the ESSnuSB+ additions.</p>

<p>2026-01-22, <strong>Two-loop rainbow neutrino masses in a non-invertible symmetry</strong>, Hiroshi Okada et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15749v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.15749v1</a></p>

<p>We propose two-loop rainbow type of the neutrino mass model via ${Z}_2$ gauging of ${Z}_6$ non-invertible symmetry in which we introduce three families of isospin doublet vector-like fermions, heavy right-handed neutrinos and isospin doublet and singlet bosons. All new fields, which have nonzero charges under the non-invertible symmetry, can be dark matter candidates, since the non-invertible symmetry possesses a remnant ${Z}_2$ symmetry that plays a role in assuring the stability of our dark matter candidate. Even though the non-invertible symmetry is dynamically broken at one-loop level, its violation does not affect our scenario. In this paper, we especially consider the lightest mode of the neutral components in the doublet vector-like fermions as our main dark matter candidate. The dark matter is potentially degenerated to the other two families of neutral fermions, since the mass difference is induced at one-loop level. Thus, we consider our dark matter candidate in rather simpler co-annihilation system among their particles. Considering all the constraints of neutrino oscillation data, lepton flavor violations, muon $g-2$ and the relic density of dark matter, we perform the numerical analysis and show some allowed regions for these phenomenology. Due to our dark matter nature, the sum of neutrino masses in case of normal hierarchy is larger than that in case of inverted hierarchy, which is opposite situation compared with typical active neutrino models.</p>

<p>2026-01-22, <strong>Development of an early warning method incorporating pre-supernova neutrino light curves</strong>, Keita Saito et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15691v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.15691v1</a></p>

<p>Massive stars ($M&gt;8\mathrm{M_\odot}$) emit neutrinos known as pre-supernova (pre-SN) neutrinos through thermal and nuclear interactions for cooling the stellar core during the final stage of stellar evolution. Real-time monitoring of their pre-SN neutrino interaction rate offers a crucial opportunity to issue an early warning to a core-collapse supernova. Some neutrino detectors, including KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande already operate pre-SN alarm systems based on a statistically significant excess of the observed event rate over the expected background. To improve alarm sensitivity, we propose an alarm method which incorporates the time evolution of the observed pre-SN neutrino event rate. The method uses a log likelihood ratio test that references multiple theoretical stellar-evolution models and treats the core collapse time as a nuisance parameter to be profiled over. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using simulated data for the KamLAND, Super-Kamiokande with dissolved Gadolinium (SK-Gd) and their combined analysis. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the warning time compared to the conventional rate-only method, while maintaining the same false alarm rate.</p>

<p>2026-01-21, <strong>Exploring Quantumness at Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiments</strong>, Murshed Alam et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15375v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.15375v1</a></p>

<p>Violations of classicality can be probed through measurements performed on a system at different times, as proposed by Leggett and Garg. Specifically, violations of Leggett-Garg inequalities suggest the presence of quantum effects in macroscopic systems. Long-baseline neutrino experiments provide some of the longest available propagation distances over which such tests can be performed. Previous studies of Leggett-Garg tests in the neutrino sector have largely focused on showing that the oscillation probabilities can violate classical bounds for certain parameter choices. In this work, we develop a more complete and data-driven framework that treats both the distributions representing the classical and quantum behavior, as well as the experimental uncertainties. We consider MINOS, T2K, NOvA, as well as the upcoming DUNE, and present the respective statistical significance for distinguishing quantum behavior from classical scenarios at these long-baseline neutrino experiments. Among them, we find that T2K yields the most significant violation of classicality, at the level of $\sim 14 σ$, with NOvA and projections for DUNE also resulting in a significance of more than $5σ$.</p>

<p>2026-01-21, <strong>Single-wave solutions of the neutrino fast flavor system. Part I. Mechanical properties</strong>, Damiano F. G. Fiorillo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15372v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.15372v1</a></p>

<p>A dense neutrino plasma can exhibit collective flavor evolution caused by neutrino–neutrino refraction. Recently, a new class of exact nonlinear inhomogeneous solutions was discovered: single-wave (SW) solutions of the fast flavor system. The key property is that the flavor occupation numbers remain homogeneous, whereas the field of flavor coherence varies spatially with a single wave vector. The equations of motion for this structure resemble those of a collection of classical spins, in analogy with the homogeneous slow and fast flavor cases. In contrast, the SW system is not integrable (it does not possess Gaudin invariants) so that, while two-beam pendulum solutions are inevitable, they do not extend to a multi-angle system. We develop a taxonomy of all known nonlinear collective flavor solutions, explaining the overlap between categories and their differences.</p>

<p>2026-01-21, <strong>DAMSA Experiment Conceptual Design White Paper</strong>, Prithak Bhattarai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15255v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.15255v1</a></p>

<p>DAMSA (DArk Messenger Searches at an Accelerator) is a novel short-baseline accelerator experiment aimed at probing short-lived physics processes, including searches for evidence of a dark sector of particle physics and well-motivated Standard Model signals. Motivated by open questions in neutrino physics and the absence of conclusive evidence for conventional weakly interacting massive particles, DAMSA targets MeV-to-sub-GeV dark-sector messengers with feeble couplings that can be produced in abundance at the PIP-II LINAC. By employing an ultra-short baseline of order one meter, DAMSA is uniquely positioned to overcome the beam-dump “ceiling” that limits sensitivity to promptly decaying particles in longer-baseline experiments. The conceptual design emphasizes a beam-dump production scheme combined with a compact detector optimized for rare decays while mitigating intense neutron-induced backgrounds inherent to high-power proton beams. To validate the experimental strategy and detector technologies, the Little DAMSA Path-Finder (LDPF) proof-of-concept experiment is proposed, focusing on axion-like particles decaying to two photons and operating with 300 MeV electron beams at FAST. Successful realization of LDPF will establish the feasibility of the DAMSA approach, enabling a broad and powerful program to explore short-lived new physics and precision Standard Model processes in a previously inaccessible regime. This conceptual design document outlines the technical details of DAMSA’s physics goals, the beam facility proposals, key experimental challenges and how to overcome them, and the proposed experimental staging campaigns.</p>

<p>2026-01-21, <strong>Testing the three massive neutrino paradigm: Constraints on Neutrino Properties and Interactions from Recent Experimental Data</strong>, João Paulo Pinheiro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14851v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.14851v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino physics offers unique insights into phenomena beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This thesis presents phenomenological investigations organized around three pillars: consolidation of the three-flavor oscillation paradigm, exploration of new physics viability, and precise determination of solar neutrino fluxes.   The theoretical framework introduces massive neutrinos, leptonic mixing, and flavor transitions, followed by experimental results emphasizing Borexino and NOvA data analyses.   The first pillar establishes the three-flavor framework through global analysis of solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator data, providing updated determinations of mixing angles ($θ_{12}$, $θ_{13}$, $θ_{23}$) and mass-squared differences ($Δm^2_{21}$, $Δm^2_{31}$), while quantifying ambiguities in mass ordering and $θ_{23}$ octant.   The second pillar investigates Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) with electrons and quarks, combining Borexino data with COHERENT’s CE$ν$NS measurements to establish bounds on propagation and detection couplings, excluding viable NSI parameter regions including potential LMA-D solutions.   The third pillar advances solar neutrino physics through precision flux determinations, integrating pp-chain and CNO-cycle measurements. Results show preference for high-metallicity Standard Solar Models and incompatibility between $3+1$ mixing parameters favored by Gallium experiments and solar observations.   This synthesis guides future experiments toward resolving mass ordering, CP violation, and dark sector interactions.</p>

<p>2026-01-21, <strong>Benchmarking neutrino-nucleus quasielastic scattering model predictions against a missing energy profile obtained using a monoenergetic neutrino beam</strong>, Jake McKean et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14831v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.14831v2</a></p>

<p>We examine three exclusive nuclear ground state shell models implemented in the NEUT neutrino event generator and benchmark them against the recent JSNS$^2$ measurement of missing energy using a monoenergetic neutrino source. The nature of the measurement allows a detailed investigation of nuclear ground-state modeling using a neutrino source, and gives access to a direct measurement of the neutron spectral function in a $^{12}$C nucleus. The NEUT intranuclear cascade and nuclear deexcitation \textsc{NucDeEx} are used to simulate inelastic final-state interactions and nuclear deexcitations respectively. We find that the spectral function (SF) models perform better than relativistic mean field models in modeling both the ground state and the tail of the missing energy distribution when the NEUT cascade and nuclear excitation channels are turned on. We also find that taking into account the missing energy threshold for single nucleon knockout interactions results in all nuclear models being accepted based on the obtained $p$-values.</p>

<p>2026-01-22, <strong>Spatially resolved stellar-to-total dynamical mass relation: Radial variations, gradients and profiles of galaxy stellar populations</strong>, L. Scholz-Diaz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16019v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.16019v1</a></p>

<p>Although galaxy evolution is governed by the interplay between baryonic physics and dark matter halo assembly, how halo properties shape observed galaxies remains unclear. With current challenges in measuring halo properties, the stellar-to-total dynamical mass relation is introduced as an alternative metric sensitive to the dark matter content within galaxies. We explore how spatially resolved stellar population properties vary across this relation using optical IFS data and photometry from 265 CALIFA galaxies. Spatially resolved ages and metallicities, [M/H], are derived using a Bayesian framework fed with a library of model spectra based on stochastic star formation and metallicity histories and dust attenuation. We study these properties in terms of both stellar and total dynamical mass, with the latter being enclosed mass within three effective radii from Jeans dynamical modeling. We find that ages and [M/H] measured at different annuli depend on both stellar and total mass, yet showing distinct radial trends. While the dependence of age on total mass is more prominent in the outskirts, that of [M/H] is significant in the inner parts. This behavior is reflected in the stellar population profiles and gradients, more strongly for age and connected to morphology. Intermediate-mass early-types have higher stellar-to-total mass ratios and flatter age profiles with older ages, and steep negative [M/H] profiles, whereas later-types have lower stellar-to-total mass ratios, negative age profiles with younger ages and shallower negative [M/H] profiles. Moreover, at fixed stellar mass galaxies have more negative age gradients and shallower [M/H] ones as total mass increases. Our results show that total dynamical mass is linked to systematic variations in stellar populations and radial gradients at fixed stellar mass, suggesting a relevant role of dark matter halos in shaping galaxy properties</p>

<p>The SABRE North experiment is developing ultra-high radiopurity NaI(Tl) detectors to investigate dark matter. To achieve this, SABRE North utilizes the technique called zone refining for NaI powder purification. This work details the mathematical model developed to describe the purification process. By comparing this model to the results of the commissioning and production runs conducted prior to crystal growth, the distribution coefficients were determined for various impurities, contained in the powder at the parts-per-billion (ppb) level. Furthermore, the synthesis of data from both zone refining and normal freezing is discussed. These findings can be used to predict the SABRE North detectors background level in the energy region-of-interest for dark matter search and to optimize the production of ultra-high purity crystals through multiple purification strategies.</p>

<p>Compact astrophysical systems such as neutron stars and black holes provide powerful laboratories for testing feebly coupled dark photons (DPs). We investigate light DPs kinetically mixed with the visible photon that need not be the dark matter, focusing on resonant photon-DP oscillations in magnetized, modeled plasma environments. We show that realistic non-monotonic plasma density profiles generically enhance resonant conversion relative to monotonic models, leading to substantially stronger constraints on the photon-DP kinetic mixing parameter ($ε$). Using spectral data from the supermassive black hole (SMBH) M87*, extending to the LOFAR band, we derive a bound $ε\simeq 7\times10^{-6}$ at the DP mass $m_{A’} \simeq 5\times10^{-7}\,\mathrm{eV}$ for oscillation distance $3r_{\rm ph}$, where $r_{\rm ph}$ denotes the photon sphere radius. From the Crab pulsar-wind Nebula, we obtain an even stronger constraint, $ε\simeq 8\times10^{-7}$ at $m_{A’} \simeq 4\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}$ for oscillation baselines of order $10^{3}\,\mathrm{km}$, surpassing existing astrophysical limits in realistic plasma backgrounds. While laboratory and cosmological bounds remain slightly stronger at comparable masses, observation of compact objects with larger surface magnetic fields and measurements of photon spectra at lower frequencies would enhance the limits on the photon-DP coupling by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>The dark matter and existence of new particles are now a possible explanation of several physics phenomena which evade the predictions of the Standard Model. In this context Axion-Like-Particles (ALP) with masses in the MeV to GeV range with additional Peccei-Quinn breaking contribution, and which are coupled to the Standard Model have been postulated. To search for the existence of such new particles, we have launched dedicated analysis of a high statistics data sample collected by High-Acceptance Di-Electron Spectrometer (HADES) operating at GSI in Darmstadt. In particular, we study $η$ meson decays into $π^{+}π^{-}e^{+}e^{-}$, where hypothesized isoscalar gauge boson $a$ could be produced in the intermediate state $η\toπ^{+}π^{-}a$ decaying predominantly to $e^{+}e^{-}$. In this report we describe the analysis strategy we applied to search for a resonant peak in the dilepton invariant mass spectrum $η\toπ^{+}π^{-}a\to π^{+}π^{-}e^{+}e^{-}$ and present the method for event selection and particle identification.</p>

<p>Recent high-resolution imaging observations of strong lens systems reveal dense low-mass perturbers. We propose a soliton core, whose central density is boosted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH), in the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) model as an efficient perturber in strong gravitational lensing. The higher central density makes it less efficient in the tidal mass loss, and leads to the higher impact in gravitational lensing. We show that the mass profile of a $\sim 10^6M_\odot$ perturber in JVAS B1938+666, which does not resemble any known astronomical object, can be wel explained by a soliton core in the FDM model with the mass of $4\times 10^{-21}$eV hosting an SMBH with the mass of $4\times 10^5M_\odot$. The high mass of the SMBH may be explained by several scenarios that predcit heavy SMBH seeds such as the direct collapse black hole formation and primordial black holes.</p>

<p>We discuss a potential survey to map dark matter and the emergence of large-scale structure to redshift z ~ 1.5 (baseline) or z~3.5 (with near-IR extension) using a massively multiplexed spectrograph on a 10m-class telescope, such as the proposed Widefield Spectroscopic Telescope.</p>

<p>Inspired by regular black holes (RBHs) sourced by dark matter halos, we generalize the anisotropic energy-momentum tensor by relaxing the $P_r = -ρ$ condition between radial pressure and density. We demonstrate that while RBHs are a unique special case, a broader class of relations yields horizonless compact stars. Under specific parameter limits, these objects approach a ``frozen state,” mimicking black hole features without an event horizon. These compact star solutions could satisfy weak energy conditions and provide a robust mechanism for dark matter-sourced black hole mimickers.</p>

<p>2026-01-21, <strong>Hierarchical bayesian inference: constraining population distribution of dark matter halo shapes via stellar streams</strong>, David Chemaly et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15373v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.15373v1</a></p>

<p>Stellar streams, the debris of tidally disrupted satellites, trace their host’s gravitational potential and thus probe dark matter halo structure. While six-dimensional phase-space data of Galactic streams enable precise dark matter halo modelling in the Milky Way, streams around external galaxies are typically available only as low surface brightness features without kinematics (i.e. two-dimensional photometric data), providing only weak constraints when considered individually. We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework that infers the population distribution of halo flattening using only projected stream tracks. Streams are forward-modelled in StreaMAX, a new JAX-accelerated particle-spray package that achieves orders of magnitude faster stream generation when compared to traditional methods. For each stream we fit an axisymmetric dark matter halo model and obtain a posterior on the flattening. These posteriors are then combined through hierarchical reweighting to constrain the population distribution. Using mock data, we show that individual fits recover the correct flattening with modest precision and exhibit projection-induced multi-modalities. Nevertheless, aggregating these fits yields accurate and confident constraints on the underlying population distribution of dark matter halo morphologies, clearly distinguishing between oblate, spherical, and prolate populations. The total computational cost scales linearly with sample size. Our results demonstrate that ensembles of purely photometric streams carry sufficient information to constrain dark matter halo shapes in external galaxies at the population level. With the forthcoming samples from Euclid and Rubin/LSST, this approach offers a practical path to population-level inferences of halo morphology without any kinematic measurements.</p>

<p>2026-01-21, <strong>Combined constraints on dark photons from high-energy collisions, cosmology, and astrophysics</strong>, A. W. Romero Jorge et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15066v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.15066v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate a dark sector coupled to the Standard Model (SM) through a kinetically mixed dark photon $U$ associated with a new $U(1)’$ gauge symmetry. Kinetic mixing $\varepsilon$ induces an effective coupling to the electromagnetic current, while $U$ interacts with stable dark matter (DM) $χ$ via a dark gauge coupling $g_χ$. Our analysis is based on the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, extended to include dark photon production and decay into dileptons ($U!\to e^+e^-$). In PHSD, dark photons are produced in high-energy collisions through Dalitz decays of light mesons ($π^0,η,η’,ω$), Delta-resonances ($Δ!\to N U$), direct vector meson decays ($ρ,ω,φ!\to U$), kaon decays, and $q\bar q!\to U$ annihilation. Building on previous PHSD benchmarks against dilepton data, we extract upper limits on $\varepsilon^2(m_U,m_χ,α_χ)$ in both the visible regime ($m_U&lt;2m_χ$), where $U!\to e^+e^-$ dominates, and the invisible regime ($m_U&gt;2m_χ$), where $U!\toχ\barχ$ is kinematically open. Cosmological and astrophysical constraints are incorporated in two complementary ways. First, we compute the velocity-dependent self-interaction cross section $σ/m_χ$ for Yukawa-mediated SIDM and confront it with bounds from dwarf galaxies, galaxy groups, and clusters. Second, we determine thermal relic target curves by computing the relic abundance and requiring $Ω_{\rm DM}h^2\simeq 0.12$, consistent with \textit{Planck} measurements of the cosmic microwave background. Combining PHSD limits on $\varepsilon^2$ with relic density and self-interaction requirements, we exclude regions of the $(m_χ,m_U)$ plane for each DM realization (Dirac, Majorana, or complex scalar) and identify benchmark scenarios in which heavy-ion, cosmological, and astrophysical constraints are simultaneously satisfied.</p>

<p>In this paper we have developed general algorithm for finding all orbifolds of Berglund-Hubsch-type Calabi-Yau manifolds and their mirrors. An explicit construction is formulated for finding all admissible deformations and groups defining mirror pairs of orbifolds. Then using our algorithm for one of the Calabi-Yau manifolds, defined by a Fermat-type polynomial, we found all mirror pairs of orbifolds. For this model, for each pair of orbifolds, the number of generations and the number of singlets i.e. particles participating only in gravitational interactions (dark matter particles) were found.</p>

<p>Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical particles and compelling candidates for cold dark matter. Their existence could be probed through their conversions into photons in the presence of magnetic fields. In this work, we explore the effect of these photon-ALP conversions by searching for an attenuation in the observed gamma ray spectra of galactic sources that emit at energies of hundreds of TeV. We analyze data from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory for the source 3HWC J1908+063. No evidence of photon-ALP conversions was found, and we set constraints on the ALP parameter space. Specifically, we derive exclusion limits for ALPs with masses in the range $10^{-8}~\mathrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 10^{-6}~\mathrm{eV}$ and photon-ALP couplings in the range $10^{-12}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1} \leq g_{aγ} \leq 10^{-10}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, based on HAWC observations.</p>

<p>Analyses of type Ia supernovae have helped us shed light on the existence and nature of dark energy. Most of these analyses have relied on Bayesian techniques. In this work, we rely on resampling techniques to analyse supernova data. In particular, we use the generalised least squares method together with Jackknife and Bootstrap techniques to estimate parameters of $Λ$CDM, flat $Λ$CDM, $w$CDM, flat $w$CDM, and flat $w_0\,w_a$CDM models from the recent PantheonPlus and SH0ES data. For completeness, we also perform Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and nested sampling algorithms, and compare the results. We note that resampling techniques can help highlight the limitations of the data. For instance, we see that the Jackknife method estimates a strong positive correlation between $h$ and $M$ and higher standard deviations for both. This may have significant implications for the Hubble tension. We conclude with a discussion of our results.</p>

<p>Magnetars are extreme neutron stars powered by ultra-strong magnetic fields ($\sim10^{14}$ Gauss) and are compelling engines for some of the most powerful extragalactic transients such as Super Luminous Supernovae, Gamma-Ray Bursts, and Fast Radio Bursts. Yet their formation rate relative to ordinary neutron stars remains uncertain, often precluding direct comparisons with the rates of these extragalactic transients. Furthermore, magnetars have been recently shown to be evolutionarily related to other neutron star classes, complicating the estimate of the exact magnetar fraction within the neutron star population. We study the magnetar birth fraction in core-collapse supernovae using pulsar population synthesis of all isolated neutron star classes in our Galaxy, incorporating self-consistently the Galactic dynamical evolution, spin-down and magneto-thermal evolution. This approach allows us to derive strong constraints from small close-to-complete observational samples. In particular, looking at the age-limited young ($&lt;$2 kyr) neutron star population in the Milky Way we find 24 detected young neutron stars, with only 10 of them (41%) being classical rotational powered pulsars, while the others (59%) are either magnetars or central compact objects, the latter believed to be equally magnetically powered. We further compare the results with the nearby volume-limited class ($&lt;$500 pc) of X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron stars, old nearby magnetars. We conclude that the observed population of isolated neutron stars in the Galaxy can be reproduced only by assuming a core-collapse supernova rate larger than two, and a larger magnetar fraction than previously inferred. By assuming a bimodal initial magnetic field ($B_0$) distribution at birth, we find that the magnetar class peaks between $B_0\sim 1-2.5\times10^{14}$ Gauss and represents on average $\sim50$% of the entire neutron star population.</p>

<p>Intrinsic alignments are a major astrophysical contaminant for next generation large-sky surveys like Euclid and LSST. Large hydrodynamic simulations are crucial for informing the alignment modelling for these surveys. We measure position-position and position-shape correlations of a Luminous Red Galaxy sample from the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, measuring the alignment signal for more than 4.9 million galaxies at redshift 0. We jointly model the clustering and alignment correlations to provide the tightest constraints on the alignment amplitude to date from a hydrodynamic simulation. We find that both the Non-Linear Alignment (NLA) and the more complex Tidal Alignment Tidal Torquing (TATT) models provide good fits to the data. We compare the measured $A_1$ amplitude to observational data and find good agreement. We measure the dependence of the NLA and TATT free parameters on halo mass. We also introduce a mass-dependent TATT model, TATT-M, by finding empirical relations between the halo mass and the TATT parameters. This allows us to fit TATT with only one parameter, $A_1$, with $A_2/A_1$ being a constant and $A_{1δ}/A_1$ being a function of halo mass. Using a Bayesian approach, we find that TATT-M is very strongly preferred by the data over NLA. Using the baryonic feedback variations of the FLAMINGO simulation suite, we test whether the TATT parameters are sensitive to feedback. Variations in AGN and supernova feedback do not significantly change the alignment amplitude beyond the change associated with the dependence of galaxy stellar mass on the strength of feedback. Our results inform the IA modelling for upcoming surveys by providing guidance on model choices, priors and sensitivities to feedback.</p>

<p>Nuclear astrophysics aims at unraveling the cosmic origins of chemical elements and the physical processes powering stars. It constitutes a truly multidisciplinary field, that integrates tools, advancements, and accomplishments from theoretical astrophysics, observational astronomy, cosmochemistry, and theoretical and experimental atomic and nuclear physics. For instance, the advent of high-energy astrophysics, facilitated by space-borne observatories, has ushered in a new era, offering a unique, panchromatic view of the universe (i.e., allowing multifrequency observations of stellar events); supercomputers are also playing a pivotal role, furnishing astrophysicists with computational capabilities essential for studying the intricate evolution of stars within a multidimensional framework; cosmochemists, through examination of primitive meteorites, are uncovering tiny fragments of stardust, shedding light on the physical processes operating in stars and on the mechanisms that govern condensation of stellar ejecta into solids; simultaneously, nuclear physicists managed to measure nuclear reactions at (or close to) stellar energies, using both stable and radioactive ion beam facilities. This paper provides a multidisciplinary view on nucleosynthesis accompanying stellar explosions, with a specific focus on thermonuclear supernovae, classical novae, and type I X-ray bursts.</p>

<p>We present a multi-epoch test of f(T) gravity with nonminimal torsion-matter coupling, combining early- and late-Universe observations. At the MeV scale, Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis constrains the fractional variation of the weak freeze-out temperature, |δτ_f/τ_f|, thereby mapping light-element abundances into limits on deviations from the standard expansion history. At low redshift, we confront the model with type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic-chronometer data, which respectively probe distances, the late-time standard ruler, and the Hubble rate. Independent analyses highlight the complementary roles of each dataset, while a joint SNe Ia + BAO + CC fit breaks degeneracies and yields the tightest combined bounds. As an illustration, we examine two representative torsion-modified gravity scenarios: BBN strongly limits large departures from standard cosmology, whereas late-time probes remain compatible with a near-ΛCDM background. This unified approach demonstrates the power of linking early-Universe nuclear physics with precision cosmological observables in assessing torsional extensions of gravity.</p>

<p>We present an upgraded detailed numerical calculations of supernova (SN) interactions with significantly aspherical circumstellar matter (CSM), primarily formed as a disc or bipolar lobes. The circumstellar disc can arise as a result of, for example, mass transfer in a binary, while bipolar lobes can be the result of a violent pre-explosive ejection of matter, similar to the iconic cases of luminous blue variable stars (LBVs). We numerically simulate the radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) behaviour of interaction processes using a 2D cylindrical version of the RHD code CASTRO. We then calculate light curves, spectral patterns, and polarisation profiles, all up to a relatively long time of two years after an SN shock breakout and from different directions, using the multidimensional Monte Carlo radiation transfer (MC-RT) codes SEDONA and SIROCCO. We calculated a total of five models for the two aforementioned configurations of the surrounding CSM, for stratified density levels, comparing the simulated hydrodynamic behaviour and differences in their observable properties. RHD models exhibit similar behaviour to previous adiabatic models, but with a significantly slower expansion velocity. The calculated light curves show a relatively smooth evolution in SN-disc interaction, and declines and brightening in SN-lobes interaction. Comparing models with real events with a presumed similar physical process provides guidance for selecting a more accurate CSM configuration when simulating real situations.</p>

<p>I compare seven actively studied r-process nucleosynthesis scenarios against observed properties of r-process elements in the early Universe, and conclude that the most likely scenario to contribute to the site of elements below the third r-process peak is the magnetorotational r-process scenario, and that of the third peak is the common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) r-process scenario. The collapsar and CEJSN r-process scenario might also contribute to the lighter r-process elements, and the binary neutron star (NS-NS) merger r-process scenario might contribute to the third r-process peak. The magnetar, the wind from the newly born NS, and the accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf r-process scenarios fall short in explaining observations. They might exist, but cannot be major contributors to the r-process in the early Universe. To constrain r-process scenarios in the early Universe, I require that they explain the large scatter in the r-process abundances of very metal-poor stars, account for the correlation between light r-process nucleosynthesis and iron production, and the lack of correlation between the third peak r-process production and iron production, as inferred from very metal-poor stars. I discuss the diversity of the CEJSN r-process scenario and encourage extending its exploration.</p>

<p>We present a measurement of the angular Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale from the completed Dark Energy Survey (DES) dataset excluding the area of overlap with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We follow the same methodology and validation process as in the DES Y6 BAO analysis. We interpret the impact of this measurement in the context of the statistical preference for $w_0w_a$CDM over $Λ$CDM when combined with DES Y5 Type Ia supernovae (SN), Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and DESI BAO. Based on our previous work, using the full Y6 DES BAO sample, in combination with SN, CMB and DESI DR1 BAO, added 0.3$σ$ in this preference (from 3.7$σ$ to 4.0$σ$), but this ignored possible correlations between datasets. Using our new DESI-independent DES BAO likelihood instead, we find a smaller increase in the statistical preference for $w_0w_a$CDM, from 3.7$σ$ to 3.8$σ$ when using DESI DR1 BAO, and from 4.0$σ$ to 4.1$σ$ when updating to the more recent DESI DR2 BAO. These significances reduce to 3.1$σ$ when using the new calibrated DES SN-Dovekie. Alongside this work, we publicly release BAOfit_wtheta, the BAO fitting code for the angular correlation function used in the DES Y6 BAO analysis.</p>

<p>We present a detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the Type IIP supernova SN~2023zcu, which exploded in the galaxy NGC~2139 (redshift $z$ = 0.006). SN~2023zcu exhibits a well-sampled light curve covering the rise, plateau, and nebular phases. It has an optically thick phase of $100.6 \pm 0.6$ d with a magnitude drop of $\sim$1.7 mag in the {\em V} band during the transition between the plateau and the nebular phases. Weak emission features in the early-time spectra indicate a low-level interaction between circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta. The spectral evolution is well sampled and exhibits a prominent P-Cygni profile of H$α$, a defining characteristic of Type IIP SNe. Signatures of metal-line formation (e.g., \ion{Fe}{2}, \ion{Ca}{2} near-infrared triplet) are also evident in the spectra as the SN evolves. Spectral modeling with the radiative-transfer code \texttt{TARDIS} during the early photospheric phase (8.7–35.5 d since explosion) yields photospheric temperatures decreasing from $\sim$9,000 to $\sim$6,000 K and expansion velocities declining from $\sim$10,000 to $\sim$5,400 km s$^{-1}$. A tailored expanding photosphere method (EPM) fit based on the \texttt{TARDIS} models provides a distance estimate of $27.8 \pm 2.0$ Mpc. Nebular-phase spectra and bolometric light-curve modeling suggest a progenitor mass in the range 12–15 M$_\odot$. This thorough analysis helps to constrain progenitor properties and explosion parameters, thereby strengthening our understanding of Type IIP SNe.</p>

<p>G284.3$-$1.8 is a supernova remnant with a radio shell and thermal X-ray emission. Located near its center is the gamma-ray binary 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856, although the physical association between the two systems is not clear yet. Our X-ray spectroscopy with Suzaku reveals that G284.3$-$1.8 and 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856 have compatible absorption column densities of $N_\mathrm{H} = 6\textrm{–}7 \times 10^{21}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, indicating that the two systems have similar distances. The actual distance is determined as $3~\mathrm{kpc}$ using $\mathrm{^{12}CO}$ ($J=1\textrm{–}0$) data obtained with NANTEN. The X-ray spectrum of G284.3$-$1.8 shows a strong K-shell emission line of Mg, confirming that the earlier claim that the SNR is one of the few Mg-rich SNRs. Comparing recent stellar models taking into account the “shell merger” processes, we find that the obtained Mg-to-Ne mass ratio of $M_\mathrm{Mg}/M_\mathrm{Ne} = 0.73^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ and Si-to-Mg mass ratio of $M_\mathrm{Si}/M_\mathrm{Mg} = 0.44\pm0.03$ suggest a supernova explosion that would have left a neutron star. The characteristics of 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856, on the other hand, are better explained with a model in which its compact object is neutron star. The present results, therefore, would suggest a possible scenario where G284.3$-$1.8 and 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856 are both remnants of a common supernova explosion although further observational tests are necessary.</p>

<p>2026-01-21, <strong>Cosmological Constraints on f(T,B) Gravity from Observations of Early and Late Universe</strong>, Yahia Al-Omar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14729v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2601.14729v1</a></p>

<p>We present a unified framework that combines early- and late-Universe observations to constrain three functional realizations of f(T,B) gravity: the linear, quadratic, and general power-law models. First, constraints on deviations from the standard weak interaction freeze-out temperature are derived using the most recent measurements of the primordial helium-4 mass fraction. Second, we perform a joint analysis incorporating five priors: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic chronometers, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, and Cosmic Microwave Background in order to place bounds on the model parameters. The joint likelihood analysis significantly tightens the constraints compared to individual datasets. Third, we test the null, strong, and dominant energy conditions to evaluate the physical viability of the best-fit solutions across the cosmic redshift range. Our results show that all three f(T,B) models are consistent with current observations and exhibit stable behavior under the energy-condition criteria, supporting torsion-boundary modified gravity as a robust and viable alternative to General Relativity.</p>
