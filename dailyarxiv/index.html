<p>2025-08-13, <strong>Gravitational Wave Signatures of $\mathrm{U(1)_X}$ Breaking and Right-Handed Neutrino Dynamics</strong>, Arnab Chaudhuri et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09835v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.09835v1</a></p>

<p>The Standard Model (SM) leaves several fundamental questions unanswered, including the origin of neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, and the nature of dark matter. Motivated by these gaps, we investigate an extension of the SM with an additional local $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry and a complex scalar singlet that spontaneously breaks this symmetry via its vacuum expectation value. The extended framework naturally accommodates three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) to ensure anomaly cancellation and implements a type-I seesaw mechanism for active neutrino masses. We perform a detailed numerical analysis demonstrating consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, including predictions for the effective Majorana mass parameter relevant to neutrinoless double beta decay. Furthermore, we estimate the key parameters of the first-order phase transition and compute the resulting stochastic gravitational wave spectrum, demonstrating that it can lie within the reach of forthcoming experiments such as LISA, DECIGO, BBO, and the Einstein Telescope. The right-handed neutrinos also open a viable path for thermal leptogenesis, providing a unified link between neutrino mass generation, baryogenesis, and gravitational wave signatures. Our results demonstrate that this minimal $U(1)_X$ scenario remains a promising probe for physics beyond the Standard Model, accessible through upcoming gravitational wave and neutrino experiments.</p>

<p>2025-08-13, <strong>Neutrino Mass Predictions with an AI-based Algorithm under $A_4$ Modular Symmetry</strong>, Muhammad Waheed Aslam et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09579v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.09579v1</a></p>

<p>This research undertakes a comprehensive exploration of neutrino mass model grounded in $A_4$ discrete non-Abelian modular symmetry formulated within a linear seesaw framework that modifies the conventional type-I seesaw structure with a focus on optimizing the model parameters using incomprehensible but intelligible-in-time logics optimization algorithm (ILA), an AI-based algorithm. In contrast to traditional discrete flavor symmetry frameworks, modular symmetry significantly reduces the number and complexity of flavon fields needed to generate realistic fermion mass textures. The key predictions include neutrino masses, $U_{PMNS}$ matrices, effective neutrino masses for neutrinoless double beta decay, beta decay, Dirac and Majorana CP violation phases for normal (NO) and inverted mass ordering (IO), offering testable implications. The working efficiency of the ILA optimization technique is also estimated. The optimized neutrino oscillation parameters are well consistent with recent experimental data. Our analysis also aligns with Planck cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses $0.06&lt;\Sigma m&lt;0.12$.</p>

<p>2025-08-13, <strong>AT2022sxl: A Candidate Repeating Tidal Disruption Event in Possible Association with Two High-Energy Neutrino Events</strong>, Shunhao Ji et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09408v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.09408v1</a></p>

<p>We report a candidate repeating tidal disruption event (TDE), AT2022sxl, found from large-field optical survey data. Two flares with a separation time of $\sim$7.2\,yr between the two optical peaks are observed. Related mid-infrared (MIR) flares, with delay times of $\sim$200\,day are also seen. We analyze two optical spectra of the TDE source, onenear the optical peak of the second flare from the Transient Name Server and one at the quiescent flux level after the second flare. The latter was taken by us with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. Comparing the features of the two spectra, we identify that the host is likely a composite galaxy at redshift 0.23 and the TDE event, probably an H+He type, mainly powered broad components in the emission lines of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and He~I $\lambda$5876. More interestingly, we find that two Bronze-type neutrino events, detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory, match the TDE in position and the second flare, especially the delayed MIR flare, in time. We discuss the MIR luminosity properties of the currently reported (candidate) neutrino-emitting TDEs and suggest that luminous MIR emission is a prerequisite for neutrino production in TDEs.</p>

<p>2025-08-13, <strong>Effects of CPT violation on the neutrino charge radius in the Standard Model Extension</strong>, Yuridia Flores Orea et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09400v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.09400v1</a></p>

<p>CPT-odd effects on the neutrino charge radius are studied within the Standard Model Extension. We consider CPT violation from the electroweak Yang-Mills sector, characterized by Lorentz-violating coefficients $(k_1)_\mu$ and $(k_2)_\mu$, which have positive mass units. The $\bar{\nu}\nu \gamma$ vertex arises at tree level via exchange of two $Z$ bosons. Although suppressed by $\frac{1}{m_Z^4}$, this process is notable. The vertex function $\Gamma_\mu$ includes three independent gauge structures satisfying the Ward identity $q^\mu \Gamma_\mu = 0$, characteristic of neutral particles, and induces gauge-independent electromagnetic form factors. Besides charge and anapole, two novel form factors appear. The charge form factor $f_Q(q^2)$ contains an energy-dependent term causing $f_Q(0)\neq 0$, so electromagnetic properties are undefined for real photons with CPT violation. Instead, $f_Q$ and the charge radius are defined in the static limit: $q^0=0$ and $\mathbf{q}\to 0$. Here, $f_Q(0, \mathbf{0})=0$ and a correction to the SM neutrino charge radius is found: [ \langle r^2_\nu \rangle_{CPTV} = \frac{3c_{2W}}{2c_W^4} \left[\frac{k_2^2}{m_Z^2} + \frac{\mathbf{k}_2^2}{m_Z^2}\cos^2\theta_\gamma \right] \frac{1}{m_Z^2}, ] with $\theta_\gamma$ the angle between $\mathbf{q}$ and $\mathbf{k}_2$. Using recent bounds on $(k_i)_\mu$ and reasonable assumptions, we obtain a small correction $\langle r^2_\nu \rangle_{CPTV} \leq 0.83 \times 10^{-51}\ \mathrm{cm}^2$.</p>

<p>2025-08-12, <strong>The Neutrino Kaleidoscope: Searches for Non-Standard Neutrino Oscillations at Neutrino Telescopes with a TeV Muon Accelerator Source</strong>, Nicholas W. Kamp et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09249v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.09249v1</a></p>

<p>Muon accelerators, a potential technology for enabling $\mathcal{O}$(10 TeV) parton center of mass energy collisions, would also source an intense, collimated beam of neutrinos at TeV energies. The energy and size of this beam would be excellently matched as a source for existing and planned neutrino telescopes: gigaton-sized detectors of astrophysical neutrinos at and above TeV energies. In this paper, we introduce the technical considerations and scientific reach of pairing a muon accelerator source of neutrinos with a neutrino telescope detector, a combination we dub the ‘‘Neutrino Kaleidoscope’’. In particular, such a pairing would enable searches for non-standard oscillations of the beam neutrinos as they traverse the earth between source and detector. These non-standard neutrino oscillations could be sourced by Lorentz invariance violation, which a neutrino kaleidoscope could probe up to the quantum gravity-motivated Planck scale. Such a search would also have a reach on sterile neutrinos orders of magnitude beyond existing terrestrial limits. Finally, we touch on some of the non-oscillation potential of a neutrino kaleidoscope.</p>

<p>2025-08-12, <strong>Quantum Sensing Radiative Decays of Neutrinos and Dark Matter Particles</strong>, Zhongtian Dong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09139v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.09139v1</a></p>

<p>We explore a novel strategy for detecting the radiative decay of very weakly interacting particles by leveraging the extreme sensitivity of quantum devices, such as superconducting transmon qubits and trapped ion systems, to faint electromagnetic signals. By modeling the effective electric field induced by the decay photons, we evaluate the response of quantum sensors across two particle physics scenarios: the cosmic neutrino background and two-component dark matter. We assess the discovery potential of these devices and outline the parameter space accessible under current experimental capabilities. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum sensors can probe radiative decays of dark matter candidates using existing technology, while probing neutrino magnetic moments beyond current limits will require scalable quantum architectures with enhanced coherence.</p>

<p>2025-08-12, <strong>Multi-Energy and Multi-Sample Searches for Neutrinos from GW Events</strong>, Aswathi Balagopal V. et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09034v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.09034v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole detects neutrinos of astrophysical origin via their interactions with ice. The main array is optimized for the detection of neutrinos with energies above 1 TeV. A much smaller infill array, known as IceCube DeepCore, extends the sensitivity down to a few GeV. Neutrinos observed in both parts of the detector are used for astrophysical-source searches with multiple messengers. We present two analyses that follow up archival gravitational wave (GW) events from runs O1 through O3 of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. The first analysis uses two neutrino datasets: one with high-energy tracks and another consisting of low-energy tracks and cascades. These two neutrino datasets were previously used independently to follow-up GW events. In the analysis presented here, a combined likelihood search is performed using both datasets to search for neutrinos coincident with the GW events across a wide energy range, from a few GeV to several PeV. The second analysis, for the first time, uses a neutrino-induced cascade sample with events of energy above ~1 TeV for searches of coincident neutrino-GW emission. We present results from both analyses and discuss prospects for conducting these analyses in real time.</p>

<p>2025-08-12, <strong>Sensitivity of $W$-boson measurements to low-mass right-handed neutrinos</strong>, Rodrigo Alonso et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08903v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.08903v1</a></p>

<p>A low-mass right-handed neutrino could interact with electroweak bosons via mixing, a mediator particle, or loop corrections. Using an effective field theory, we determine constraints on these interactions from $W$-boson measurements at hadron colliders. Due to the difference in the initial states at the Tevatron and the LHC, $W$-boson decays to a right-handed neutrino would artificially increase the mass measured at the Tevatron while only affecting the difference between $W^+$ and $W^-$ mass measurements at the LHC. Measurements from CDF and the LHC are used to infer the corresponding parameter values, which are found to be inconsistent between the two. The LHC experiments can improve sensitivity to these interactions by measuring the cosine of the helicity angle using $W$ bosons produced with transverse momentum above $\approx 50$ GeV.</p>

<p>2025-08-12, <strong>Constraining Super-Heavy Dark Matter with the KM3-230213A Neutrino Event</strong>, Roberto Aloisio et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08779v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.08779v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, the KM3NeT collaboration detected an astrophysical neutrino event, KM3-230213A, with an energy of approximately $220~\rm PeV$, providing unprecedented insights into the ultra-high-energy Universe. In this study, we introduce a novel likelihood framework designed to leverage this event to constrain the properties of super-heavy dark matter (SHDM) decay. Our approach systematically integrates multi-messenger constraints from galactic and extragalactic neutrino flux measurements by IceCube, the absence of comparable neutrino events at IceCube and Auger observatories, and the latest gamma-ray experiment upper limits. Our findings impose the most stringent constraints to date, placing a lower bound on the SHDM lifetime at $\gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{29}-10^{30} \rm s$. Importantly, we identify, for the first time, the significant potential of galactic neutrino flux measurements in advancing dark matter research. Future investigations targeting astrophysical neutrinos originating from the Galactic Center at energies above $10~\rm PeV$ will be crucial, not only for understanding the origin of the cosmic-ray knee but also for exploring the possible contributions of super-heavy dark matter to our Universe.</p>

<p>2025-08-12, <strong>Detecting Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter at MeV Gamma-Ray Observatories</strong>, Subaru Fujisawa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08695v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.08695v1</a></p>

<p>We explore the indirect detection of sterile neutrino dark matter within the gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model, in which three right-handed neutrinos account for neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry, and dark matter. Focusing on the MeV mass range, we investigate two decay channels: the radiative decay $N \to \nu \gamma$, which produces a monochromatic photon, and the three-body decay $N \to e^- e^+ \nu$, which leads to a 511 keV photon signal from positronium decay. Taking the upcoming COSI mission as a case study, we show that both signals are experimentally accessible and complementary, with the 511 keV channel extending the sensitivity reach up to $O(100)$ MeV. We propose a novel analysis strategy in Compton data space to isolate the diffuse 511 keV emission. Furthermore, we incorporate, for the first time, the Sommerfeld enhancement in the decay width of $N \to e^- e^+ \nu$, enabling more accurate predictions of the signal near the kinematic threshold. The combined observation of both channels would provide a distinctive and testable signature of the sterile neutrino dark matter hypothesis.</p>

<p>2025-08-12, <strong>Fluorescence time profile measurement of LAB based liquid scintillator in response to medium relativistic ion particles</strong>, Xiaojie Luo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08546v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.08546v1</a></p>

<p>Liquid scintillator is widely used in particle physics experiments due to its high light yield, good timing resolution, scalability and low cost. Certain liquid scintillators exhibit pulse shape discrimination capabilities because of difference in fluorescence timing properties induced by different particles. Its fluoresence timing properties have been measured mostly for radioactive decay sources at MeV energies. We present a novel measurement of fluorescence time properties of LAB based liquid scintillator in response to high-energy ions of hydrogen (Z = 1), helium (Z = 2) and Krypton at around 200-300 MeV/u for the first time. We compared the results to those from radioactive sources and observed a distinct $dE/dX$ dependence, regardless of the particle type. These findings are essential for physics searches such as the diffuse supernova neutrino background in large liquid scintillator detectors like JUNO, and are also critical towards understanding the underlying scintillation timing mechanism.</p>

<p>2025-08-13, <strong>Fundamental Physics with Pulsars around Sagittarius A$^\star$</strong>, Lijing Shao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09931v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.09931v1</a></p>

<p>Searching for radio pulsars orbiting around the Galactic centre black hole (BH), Sagittarius A$^\star$ (Sgr A$^\star$), represents a holy grail goal for large-area radio telescopes, in particular for the Square Kilometre Array. Follow-up timing observation of such a PSR-Sgr A$^\star$ binary system with an orbital period $\lesssim O(1\,{\rm year})$ will bring forward a handful of new tests on different aspects of fundamental physics that are barely accessible with other means. However, mass perturbation in the Galactic centre harms the gravitational cleanness of PSR-Sgr A$^\star$ systems. In order to flexibly account for perturbations, a numerical pulsar timing model is gradually being built, which can be used to probe the spacetime around Sgr A$^\star$ BH and study the nature of dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-08-13, <strong>Cooling of dark neutron stars</strong>, B. X. Zhou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09704v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.09704v1</a></p>

<p>We study the cooling of isolated dark-matter-admixed neutron stars, employing a realistic nuclear equation of state and realistic nuclear pairing gaps, together with fermionic dark matter of variable particle mass and dark-matter fraction. The related parameter space is scanned for the stellar structural and cooling properties. We find that a consistent description of all current cooling data requires fast direct Urca cooling and reasonable proton 1S0 gaps. but no neutron 3P2 pairing. Dark matter affects the cooling properties by a modification of the nuclear density profiles, but also changes stellar radius and maximum mass. Possible signals of a large dark matter content could be a very massive but slow-cooling star or a very light but fast-cooling star.</p>

<p>2025-08-13, <strong>Unitarization of the Sommerfeld enhancement through the renormalization group</strong>, Yuki Watanabe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09511v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.09511v1</a></p>

<p>When a pair of dark matter particles interacts via a long-range force mediated by a light particle, their nonrelativistic annihilation cross section can be significantly enhanced - a phenomenon known as the Sommerfeld enhancement. This enhancement exhibits resonant behavior if the long-range potential supports shallow bound states or narrow resonances, which can lead to violations of the partial-wave unitarity bound. We identify the origin of this pathological behavior as the emergence of secular terms in perturbative expansions associated with low-energy composite states of the long-range potential. To address this issue, we propose a renormalization group improvement of the perturbative series. The resulting improved amplitude provides a unitarity-consistent form of the Sommerfeld enhancement, with its poles acquiring an imaginary part that reflects the decay width of the annihilating bound states. We also briefly discuss the implications of our approach from the perspective of Wilsonian renormalization group, and comment on its potential application to higher-order annihilation processes such as bound-state formation.</p>

<p>2025-08-12, <strong>Resurrecting the Salmon: Rethinking Mechanistic Interpretability with Domain-Specific Sparse Autoencoders</strong>, Charles O’Neill et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09363v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.09363v1</a></p>

<p>Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose large language model (LLM) activations into latent features that reveal mechanistic structure. Conventional SAEs train on broad data distributions, forcing a fixed latent budget to capture only high-frequency, generic patterns. This often results in significant linear <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dark matter'' in reconstruction error and produces latents that fragment or absorb each other, complicating interpretation. We show that restricting SAE training to a well-defined domain (medical text) reallocates capacity to domain-specific features, improving both reconstruction fidelity and interpretability. Training JumpReLU SAEs on layer-20 activations of Gemma-2 models using 195k clinical QA examples, we find that domain-confined SAEs explain up to 20\% more variance, achieve higher loss recovery, and reduce linear residual error compared to broad-domain SAEs. Automated and human evaluations confirm that learned features align with clinically meaningful concepts (e.g.,</code>taste sensations’’ or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">infectious mononucleosis''), rather than frequent but uninformative tokens. These domain-specific SAEs capture relevant linear structure, leaving a smaller, more purely nonlinear residual. We conclude that domain-confinement mitigates key limitations of broad-domain SAEs, enabling more complete and interpretable latent decompositions, and suggesting the field may need to question</code>foundation-model’’ scaling for general-purpose SAEs.</p>

<p>2025-08-12, <strong>A Promise for the JWST era: Massive black holes directly collapsed from wave dark matter haloes, and Star formation in and around their accretion flows</strong>, Xiaobo Dong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09258v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.09258v1</a></p>

<p>There are several puzzling phenomena from recent JWST observations, which seem to push the standard {\Lambda}CDM cosmology over the edge. All those puzzles can be understood in a coherent way if we assume that first massive black holes (MBHs, the “heavy eggs”) formed by directly collapsing from wave CDM haloes, which can be even earlier than the formation of first galaxies (the “chickens”). We elucidate two false obstacles that have been believed to prevent wave CDM haloes from collapsing into black holes (namely “maximum stable mass” and “bosenova”) and point out that general-relativistic instabilities (e.g., the non-axisymmetric instability numerically found in spinning scalar-field boson stars) could serve as the concrete mechanisms for direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) born from wave dark matter. Once the MBHs formed, star formation bursts in and around the accretion flows, characteristic of a special mode in compact regions of high gravitational accelerations.</p>

<p>Dark photons with kinetic mixing are compelling mediators for the interactions between dark matter and Standard Model particles. While most experimental searches focus on fully visible or fully invisible decays of dark photons, we explore processes that involve dark Higgs-strahlung, i.e. the emission of a dark Higgs boson connected to the mass generation of the dark photon. If the dark Higgs boson is the lightest dark sector particle, it is expected to be long-lived and decay into Standard Model particles via Higgs mixing. At electron-positron colliders, dark Higgs-strahlung may occur either in isolation (leading to a single displaced vertex and missing energy) or accompanied by a photon from initial-state radiation. Both signatures offer distinctive kinematic features, such as peaks in photon energy or missing invariant mass, which enable efficient background suppression and enhances sensitivity beyond existing searches. Our study suggests that Belle II could significantly improve coverage of dark sector models by targeting this previously unexplored final state and that combining dark Higgs-strahlung events with and without additional photon offers great potential for reconstructing the properties of the dark sector.</p>

<p>2025-08-12, <strong>Superheavy Q-Balls and Cosmology</strong>, J. McDonald et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08931v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.08931v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a model for the cosmological formation of superheavy Q-Balls in the mass range $10^{-7} \, M_{\odot}$ to $10^{6} \, M_{\odot}$. The model is based on a hidden sector scalar potential motivated by broken scale invariance, for which analytic Q-ball solutions and numerical simulations of condensate fragmentation exist. We show that this potential can produce superheavy Q-balls during the radiation-dominated era. As an example, we show that it is possible to produce Q-balls of mass $ \sim \,10^{6} \, M_{\odot}$ and diameter $\sim$ 100 light years, with a number density $\sim 1$ per galaxy. Such early-forming superheavy Q-balls could play a role in galaxy and supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation. We also show that it is possible to form smaller mass Q-balls with large numbers per galaxy volume, that could form SMBH by merging. Finally, we show that it is possible to produce asteroid mass Q-balls that could account for all of the dark matter whilst remaining consistent with observational limits on MACHOs.</p>

<p>2025-08-12, <strong>Search for Slow Bars in Two Barred Galaxies with Nuclear Structures: NGC 6951 and NGC 7716</strong>, Yun Hee Lee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08710v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.08710v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate two barred galaxies with nuclear structures, NGC 6951 and NGC 7716, to examine whether they host slow bars. Using Gemini/GMOS long-slit spectroscopy, we calculate the bar pattern speed with the Tremaine-Weinberg method and detect kinematically decoupled nuclear disks in both galaxies. We also measure the bar length and strength using Pan-STARRs images and identify a nuclear ring in NGC 6951 and a nuclear bar in NGC 7716 from HST/PC images. Our results indicate that NGC 6951 hosts a slow, long, and strong bar, which likely evolved through interactions with the dark matter halo and contributed to the formation of both the nuclear disk and ring. We also find hints of a rapidly rotating oval structure within the primary bar, although it is not clearly seen in the imaging data. In contrast, the primary bar in NGC 7716 is too weak to be classified as a barred galaxy, while its nuclear disk and nuclear bar are unusually large, possibly due to tidal interactions or the weakness of the primary bar. These findings suggest that slow bars may be more observed in galaxies with nuclear structures and highlight the often underappreciated role of galaxy interactions in bar evolution.</p>

<p>2025-08-12, <strong>WIMP Dark Matter within the dark photon portal</strong>, X. G. Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08676v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.08676v1</a></p>

<p>We test the dark photon as a portal connecting to the dark sector in the case of Dirac fermion and complex scalar dark matter with masses up to 1 TeV. Both the dark photon and the $Z$ boson contribute to the dark matter annihilation and dark matter–nucleon scattering processes. We derive the lower limits on the dark parameters from thermal relic density. The corresponding spin-independent dark matter–proton cross sections are compared with the upper bounds set by direct detection. We explore the allowed regions of the dark parameter space that are consistent with these constraints.</p>

<p>2025-08-12, <strong>Particle physics models of interacting bosonic dark energy and fermionic dark matter in Einstein scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity</strong>, Simran Arora et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08638v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.08638v1</a></p>

<p>We explore a cosmological framework in which a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field, acting as dark energy, interacts with a fermionic dark matter field through a coupling obtained from the point of view of particle physics. This setup is inspired by string/M-theory, and two representative scalar field potentials are investigated: exponential and power-law. A distinctive feature of the GB-coupled models is their potential to alter the propagation speed of gravitational waves (GWs), a property with significant implications in light of recent multi-messenger astrophysical observations. To account for this, we analyze models under two scenarios: one where the GW speed differs from that of light and the other where they are equal, but all consistent with current observational constraints. The dynamical evolution of the system is investigated by reformulating the field equations into an autonomous dynamical system, enabling a detailed analysis of the Universe’s long-term behavior, including the radiation-, matter- and dark energy-dominated epochs. We constrain the model parameters using a broad set of recent observational data, including mock high-redshift measurements from the Roman Space Telescope. Our findings indicate that both potentials yield cosmologies that are in excellent agreement with current data, closely tracking the expansion history predicted by the standard (\Lambda)CDM model, while still allowing room for subtle deviations that could be tested by future observations.</p>

<p>2025-08-13, <strong>Stingrays in the radio sky: Two unusual diffuse radio relic sources in the direction of the Magellanic Stream</strong>, Zachary J Smeaton et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09495v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.09495v1</a></p>

<p>We present the discovery of two extended, low surface brightness radio continuum sources, each consisting of a near-circular body and an extended tail of emission, nicknamed Stingray 1 (ASKAP J0129-5350) and Stingray 2 (ASKAP J0245-5642). Both are found in the direction of the Magellanic Stream (MS) and were discovered in the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey at 944 MHz. We combine the ASKAP data with low-frequency radio observations from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA Survey (GLEAM) to conduct a radio continuum analysis. We explore both Galactic/near Galactic scenarios, including runaway or circumgalactic supernova remnants (SNRs) and parentless pulsar-wind nebulae (PWNe), and extragalactic scenarios including radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs), dying radio galaxies, galaxy clusters, galaxy pairs or groups, head-tail radio galaxies, and Odd Radio Circles (ORCs), as well as the possibility that the morphology is due to a chance alignment. The Stingrays exhibit non-thermal emission with spectral indices of $\alpha$ = -0.89 $\pm$ 0.09 for Stingray 1 and $\alpha$ = -1.77 $\pm$ 0.06 for Stingray 2. We find that none of the proposed scenarios can explain all of the observed properties, however we determine it most likely that their shape is caused by some kind of complex environmental interaction. The most likely scenario from the available data is that of a head-tail radio galaxy, but more data is required for a definitive classification.</p>

<p>2025-08-12, <strong>Where are Gaia’s small black holes?</strong>, M. Fishbach et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08986v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.08986v1</a></p>

<p>Gaia has recently revealed a population of over 20 compact objects in wide astrometric binaries, while LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) have observed around 100 compact object binaries as gravitational-wave (GW) mergers. Despite belonging to different systems, the compact objects discovered by both Gaia and the LVK follow a multimodal mass distribution, with a global maximum at neutron star (NS) masses ($\sim 1$-$2\,M_\odot$) and a secondary local maximum at black hole (BH) masses $\sim10\,M_\odot$. However, the relative dearth of objects, or ``mass gap,” between these modes is more pronounced among the wide binaries observed by Gaia compared to the GW population, with $9^{+10}_{-6}\%$ of GW component masses falling between $2.5$–$5\,M_\odot$ compared to $\lesssim5\%$ of Gaia compact objects. We explore whether this discrepancy can be explained by the natal kicks received by low-mass BHs. GW progenitor binaries may be more likely to survive natal kicks, because the newborn BH has a more massive companion and/or is in a tighter binary than Gaia progenitor binaries. We compare the survival probabilities of Gaia and GW progenitor binaries as a function of natal kick strength and pre-supernova binary parameters, and map out the parameter space and kick strength required to disrupt the progenitor binaries leading to low-mass BHs in Gaia systems more frequently than those in GW systems.</p>
