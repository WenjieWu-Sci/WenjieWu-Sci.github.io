<p>2025-05-05, <strong>Exploring minimal two component doublet dark matter</strong>, Mariana Frank et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02816v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.02816v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a two-component dark matter (DM) scenario by extending the Standard Model with two additional $SU(2)_L$ doublets, one scalar, and another fermion. To ensure the stability of the DM components, we impose a global $Z_2 \times Z_2^\prime$ symmetry. The lightest neutral states for both the scalar and fermion, which are non-trivially transformed under the extended symmetry, behave as stable two-component DM candidates. While single components are under-abundant due to their gauge interactions, in a mass region between $m_W$ and $525$ GeV for the scalar and a mass below $1200$ GeV for the fermion, and the fermion DM conflicts with direct detection limits over the whole parameter space, having two components helps to saturate relic density in the regions with under-abundance. Compliance with direct detection constraints leads to two options, either introducing dim-5 effective operators, or embedding the scenarios into a complete UV theory, which reproduces a type-II seesaw model, thus naturally including neutrino masses. We analyze the consequences of this scenario at the LHC.</p>

<p>2025-05-05, <strong>Dynamical coupled-channel models for hadron dynamics</strong>, Michael Döring et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02745v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.02745v1</a></p>

<p>Dynamical coupled-channel (DCC) approaches parametrize the interactions and dynamics of two and more hadrons and their response to different electroweak probes. The inclusion of unitarity, three-body channels, and other properties from scattering theory allows for a reliable extraction of resonance spectra and their properties from data. We review the formalism and application of the ANL-Osaka, the Juelich-Bonn-Washington, and other DCC approaches in the context of light baryon resonances from meson, (virtual) photon, and neutrino-induced reactions, as well as production reactions, strange baryons, light mesons, heavy meson systems, exotics, and baryon-baryon interactions. Finally, we also provide a connection of the formalism to study finite-volume spectra obtained in Lattice QCD, and review applications involving modern statistical and machine learning tools.</p>

<p>2025-05-05, <strong>Neutrino magnetic moments: effective versus fundamental parameters</strong>, Christoph A. Ternes et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02633v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.02633v1</a></p>

<p>The search for neutrino magnetic moments offers a valuable window into physics beyond the Standard Model. However, a common misconception arises in the interpretation of experimental results: the assumption that the so-called effective neutrino magnetic moment is a universal, experiment-independent quantity. In reality, this effective parameter depends on the specific characteristics of each experiment, including the neutrino source, flavor composition or energy spectrum. As a result, the effective magnetic moment derived from solar neutrino data differs fundamentally from that obtained in reactor or accelerator-based experiments. Treating these quantities as directly comparable can lead to misleading conclusions. In this work, we clarify the proper definition of the effective neutrino magnetic moment in various experimental contexts and discuss the implications of this misconception for global analyses and theoretical interpretations.</p>

<p>2025-05-05, <strong>Thermonuclear Heating of Accreting Neutron Stars</strong>, Martin Nava-Callejas et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02600v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.02600v1</a></p>

<p>We describe a new method to incorporate thermonuclear heating in the envelope of accreting neutron star into long term simulations of their thermal evolution. We obtain boundary conditions for the heat exchange between the envelope and the crust based on stationary models which include nuclear burning and validate these values comparing to the results of the time-dependent code \texttt{MESA}. These simple boundary conditions allow us to explore a large parameter space. We quantify the amount of heat flowing from the envelope into the crust, or viceversa, depending on the mass accretion rate, outburst duration and duty cycle, and especially crust/core physical parameters such as impurities, crustal heating, and neutrino cooling rate.</p>

<p>2025-05-05, <strong>Rephasing invariants of CP violation for heavy and light Majorana neutrinos</strong>, Zhi-zhong Xing et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02415v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.02415v1</a></p>

<p>In the canonical seesaw mechanism, the strengths of charged-current interactions for light and heavy Majorana neutrinos are described respectively by the $3\times 3$ matrices $U$ and $R$ that are correlated with each other via the exact seesaw relation and the unitarity condition. We write out the Majorana-type invariants of CP violation of $R$ and $U$, which are insensitive to redefining the phases of three charged-lepton fields; and the Dirac-type invariants of CP violation of $R$ and $U$ that are insensitive to the rephasing of both the charged-lepton fields and the neutrino fields. Such invariants are explicitly calculated with the help of a full Euler-like block parametrization of the seesaw flavor structure containing nine active-sterile flavor mixing angles and six independent CP-violating phases, and their corresponding roles in the CP-violating asymmetries of three heavy Majorana neutrino decays and in the flavor oscillations of three light Majorana neutrinos are briefly discussed. We point out that similar rephasing invariants arising from the interplay between $R$ and $U$ may also manifest themselves in a variety of lepton-flavor-violating and lepton-number-violating processes.</p>

<p>2025-05-04, <strong>Effects of bumblebee gravity on neutrino motion</strong>, Yuxuan Shi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02290v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.02290v1</a></p>

<p>This study explores how the spontaneous violation of Lorentz symmetry – modeled through a black hole solution in the context of bumblebee gravity – affects the propagation and dynamics of neutrinos. The investigation centers on three distinct aspects: the rate of energy deposition due to neutrino-antineutrino pair annihilation, modifications to the neutrino oscillation phase driven by the underlying spacetime structure, and the influence of gravitational lensing on flavor conversion probabilities. To support the theoretical considerations, numerical simulations are conducted for oscillation probabilities in a two-flavor framework, taking into account both normal and inverted mass orderings. For comparison, the outcomes are juxtaposed with those obtained in a different Lorentz-violating background, namely, a black hole solution within Kalb-Ramond gravity.</p>

<p>2025-05-05, <strong>High-Frequency Gravitational Wave Search with ABRACADABRA-10\,cm</strong>, Kaliroë M. W. Pappas et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02821v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.02821v1</a></p>

<p>ABRACADABRA-10 cm has had great success as a pathfinder lumped-element axion dark matter experiment, setting limits on axion dark matter at the GUT scale. Now, using the interaction of gravitational waves with electrodynamics and a change in readout strategy, we use the ABRA-10 cm detector for the first search for high-frequency gravitational waves using a modified axion detector. Potential sources at these high frequencies (10 kHz to 5 MHz) include merging primordial black hole binaries or superradiance, among other beyond the standard model phenomena. This paper presents the design, results, and challenges from the ABRA-10 cm high-frequency gravitational wave search, showing it is possible to simultaneously look for axions and high-frequency gravitational waves with both searches matching theoretical expectations for sensitivity. Additionally, we conducted the first time series transient search with data from an axion experiment, achieving sensitivity to $10^{-4}$ in strain. Scaled directly to the next generation axion experiment, DMRadio-GUT, this sensitivity would imply a reach to 0.01 $M_{\odot}$ primordial black hole mergers at distances around 3 pc, with prospects to go significantly further with modifications to the readout.</p>

<p>2025-05-05, <strong>Stabilizing dark matter with quantum scale symmetry</strong>, Abhishek Chikkaballi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02803v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.02803v1</a></p>

<p>In the context of gauge-Yukawa theories with trans-Planckian asymptotic safety, quantum scale symmetry can prevent the appearance in the Lagrangian of couplings that would otherwise be allowed by the gauge symmetry. Such couplings correspond to irrelevant Gaussian fixed points of the renormalization group flow. Their absence in the theory implies that different sectors of the gauge-Yukawa theory are secluded from one another, in similar fashion to the effects of a global or a discrete symmetry. As an example, we impose the trans-Planckian scale symmetry on a model of Grand Unification based on the gauge group SU(6), showing that it leads to the emergence of several fermionic WIMP dark matter candidates whose coupling strengths are entirely predicted by the UV completion.</p>

<p>2025-05-05, <strong>A random walk model for the evolution of the halo spin vector</strong>, Jun Hou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02669v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.02669v1</a></p>

<p>We follow the spin vector evolutions of well resolved dark matter haloes (containing more than 300 particles) in merger tree main branches from the Millennium and Millennium-II N-body simulations, from z about 3.3 to z = 0. We find that there seems to be a characteristic plane for the spin vector evolution along each main branch. In the direction perpendicular to it, spin vectors oscillate around the plane, while within the plane, spin vectors show a coherent direction change as well as a diffusion in direction (possibly corresponds to a Gaussian white noise). This plane may reflect the geometry of surrounding large-scale structures. We also construct a simple stochastic model in which halo spin vector evolution is assumed to be driven by accretion of halo mass and angular momentum. This model can reproduce major features of the results from N-body simulations.</p>

<p>2025-05-05, <strong>$f(R,\mathcal{G})$-cosmological dynamics in the FLRW background</strong>, Nikolaos Dimakis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02663v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.02663v1</a></p>

<p>We examine the cosmological dynamics of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity models in a four-dimensional spatially flat FLRW metric. These models are described by $f\left( R,\mathcal{G}\right) =f\left( R+\mu \mathcal{G}\right) $ theory of gravity. They are equivalent to models linear in the Ricci scalar $R$ and in the Gauss-Bonnet scalar $\mathcal{G}$ with one nonminimally coupled scalar field without kinetic term. We analyze the stability of the de Sitter solutions and construct the phase space of the field equations to investigate the cosmological evolution. We show that $f\left( R+\mu \mathcal{G}\right) $-theory provides a double inflationary epoch, this can be used to unify the early-time and late-time acceleration phases of the universe. Moreover, we discuss the initial value problem for theory to be cosmologically viable. Finally, the effects of the cold dark matter in cosmic evolution are discussed.</p>

<p>2025-05-05, <strong>Evolving Dark Energy or Evolving Dark Matter?</strong>, Xingang Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02645v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.02645v1</a></p>

<p>We show that the latest empirical constraints on cosmology from a combination of DESI, CMB and supernova data, can be accounted for if a small component of dark matter has an evolving and oscillating equation of state within $-1&lt;w&lt;1$. From a fundamental physics perspective, this interpretation is more appealing than an evolving phantom dark energy with $w&lt;-1$, which violates the null energy condition.</p>

<p>2025-05-05, <strong>Kinetics of relativistic axionically active plasma in the field of dynamic aether. Part II: Particle dynamics and symptoms of plasma instability</strong>, Alexander B. Balakin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02551v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.02551v1</a></p>

<p>In the paper [I], the first part of our work, we established the model of interaction of five elements: first, a unit time-like vector field, associated with the velocity of dynamic aether, second, the pseudoscalar field describing an axionic component of the dark matter, third, the electromagnetic field, fourth, the relativistic multi-component plasma and, fifth, the gravitational field. The initial step of analysis of this model was the reconstruction of the equilibrium states of the axionically-aetherically active plasma, which are characterized by frequent inter-particle collisions. In the second part of the work, presented here, in the framework of isotropic homogeneous cosmological model we consider the collisionless limit of the theory, and thus, we focus on the analysis of the particle dynamics under the influence of axionically-aetherically induced forces. The complete distribution functions, as exact solutions to the kinetic equations, are presented. Based on five examples of the background solutions of the model, we discuss the symptoms of plasma instability provoked by the influence of forces of the friction and tidal types.</p>

<p>2025-05-05, <strong>The Simplest Dark Matter Model at the Edge of Perturbativity</strong>, Miguel Escudero et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02408v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.02408v1</a></p>

<p>Increasingly sensitive direct detection dark matter experiments are testing important regions of parameter space for WIMP dark matter and pushing many models to the multi-TeV regime. This brings into question the perturbativity of these models. In this context, and in light of the new limits from the LZ experiment, we investigate the status of the simplest thermal dark matter model: a singlet scalar, real or complex, coupled to the Higgs boson. We calculate the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to the direct detection rates as well as for the annihilations driving thermal freeze-out. For the complex case, we find that the entire perturbative region is excluded by direct detection. For the real case we find that the mass should be $\gtrsim 20\,{\rm TeV}$ at NLO, compared with the $\gtrsim 30\,{\rm TeV}$ LO limit. We highlight that a three-fold improvement on WIMP spin independent interactions can fully test the real scalar model in the perturbative regime. Finally, for both models, there is still an allowed (albeit narrow) region near the Higgs resonance where couplings are perturbative.</p>

<p>2025-05-04, <strong>Intermediate-mass black holes and contribution to extragalactic background light from Population III stars in Milky Way-like galaxies</strong>, Artak Mkrtchyan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02245v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.02245v1</a></p>

<p>The mass range of observed black holes extends from stellar-mass to supermassive scales, yet the existence of objects in the intermediate-mass range of $10^{2} - 10^{5} \text{M}_{\odot}$ remains unconfirmed. Black holes are suspected to compress the surrounding dark matter distribution, forming a ``spike’’. If dark matter is self-annihilating, the spike could produce gamma-ray emission sufficiently luminous to be detected. This work aims to estimate the number of expected unmerged intermediate-mass black holes in a Milky Way-like galaxy that could form such spikes. These intermediate-mass black holes are assumed to have formed from the collapse of high-mass Population III stars, such that the resulting merger rate is constrained by observations of gravitational wave emission. It is furthermore estimated to what extent the progenitor Population III stars contribute to the extragalactic background light. The Population III stars are simulated and tracked using the A-SLOTH semi-analytical simulation code and the resulting number of intermediate-mass black holes is constrained by applying the Population III binary black hole merger rate to an effective volume determined from the Population III star formation rate. In this framework, $\sim 130$ unmerged IMBHs from Population III stars are expected to reside in a Milky Way-like galaxy. The contribution of their progenitors to the EBL in the near-infrared is less than $10^{-3} \text{nW} \text{m}^{-2} \text{sr}^{-1}$, well below previous estimates.</p>

<p>2025-05-04, <strong>Prospects for disentangling dark matter with weak lensing</strong>, Calvin Preston et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02233v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.02233v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the degeneracy between the effects of ultra-light axion dark matter and baryonic feedback in suppressing the matter power spectrum. We forecast that galaxy shear data from the Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) could limit an axion of mass $m = 10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$ to be $\lesssim 5\%$ of the dark matter, stronger than any current bound, if the interplay between axions and feedback is accurately modelled. Using a halo model emulator to construct power spectra for mixed cold and axion dark matter cosmologies, including baryonic effects, we find that galaxy shear is sensitive to axions from $10^{-27}\,\mathrm{eV}$ to $10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}$, with the capacity to set competitive bounds across much of this range. For axions with $m \sim 10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$, the scales at which axions and feedback impact structure formation are similar, introducing a parameter degeneracy. We find that, with an external feedback constraint, we can break the degeneracy and constrain the axion transfer function, such that LSST could detect a $10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$ axion comprising 10\% of the dark matter at $\sim 3 \sigma$ significance. Direct reconstruction of the non-linear matter power spectrum provides an alternative way of analysing weak lensing surveys, with the advantage of identifying the scale-dependent features in the data that the dark matter model imposes. We advocate for dedicated cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with an axion dark matter component so that upcoming galaxy and cosmic microwave background lensing surveys can disentangle the dark matter-baryon transfer function.</p>

<p>2025-05-04, <strong>Light dark-matter window in $K^+\toπ^+\(+\)\not{!!E}$</strong>, Xiao-Gang He et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02031v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.02031v1</a></p>

<p>We explore the potential presence of new physics in the recent NA62 observation of the kaon decay $K^+\to\pi^+$+$\not{!!E}$ with missing energy $\not{!!E}$ in the context of a dark-matter (DM) scenario that can explain the Belle II finding of enhanced rate of the $b$-meson decay \mbox{$B^+\to K^+$+$\not{!!E}$} compared to the standard-model expectation. Specifically, assuming that a light real scalar boson $\phi$ plays the role of DM and working in an effective field-theory-framework, we study model-independently the impact of operators involving $\phi$ and ordinary quarks on the aforementioned transitions over the kaon mode’s kinematical mass region of $m_\phi &lt; (m_K - m_\pi)/2 = 177$ MeV. The DM particle is subject to significant restrictions from the observed relic abundance and from DM direct detection experiments incorporating the Migdal effect, indirect searches including that in cosmic microwave background data, and collider searches, except when its mass is between 110 MeV and 146 MeV. We demonstrate that $K^+\to\pi^+\phi\phi$ can saturate the new-physics window in the NA62 result if $m_\phi$ lies in the 110-130 MeV portion of the range left by the DM constraints.

<p>This paper presents an alternative way of analysing Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) distance measurements via rotations to define new quantities Dperp and Dpar. These quantities allow simple tests of consistency with the Planck LCDM cosmology. The parameter Dperp is determined with negligible uncertainty from Planck under the assumption of LCDM. Comparing with measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we find that the measurements of Dperp from Data Release 2 (DR2) move into significantly better agreement with the Planck LCDM cosmology compared to DESI Data Release 1 (DR1). The quantity in the orthogonal direction Dpar provides a measure of the physical matter density omega_m in the LCDM cosmology. The DR2 measurements of Dpar\ also come into better agreement with Planck LCDM compared to the earlier DR1 results. From the comparison of Planck and DESI BAO measurements, we find no significant evidence in support of evolving dark energy. We also investigate a rotation in the theory space of the w_0 and w_a parameterization of the dark energy equation-of-state w(z). We show that the combination of DESI BAO measurements and the CMB constrain w(z=0.5) = -0.996 pm 0.046, i.e. very close to the value expected for a cosmological constant. We present a critique of the statistical methodology employed by the DESI collaboration and argue that it gives a misleading impression of the evidence in favour of evolving dark energy. An Appendix shows that the cosmological parameters determined from the Dark Energy Survey 5 Year supernova sample are in tension with those from   DESI DR2 and parameters determined by Planck.</p>

<p>We show that the latest empirical constraints on cosmology from a combination of DESI, CMB and supernova data, can be accounted for if a small component of dark matter has an evolving and oscillating equation of state within $-1&lt;w&lt;1$. From a fundamental physics perspective, this interpretation is more appealing than an evolving phantom dark energy with $w&lt;-1$, which violates the null energy condition.</p>

<p>Supernova observations imply the presence of a dense and asymmetric circumstellar environment around SN Type II progenitors, whereas the mass loss from these progenitors, namely, red supergiants, is still poorly constrained. We aim to characterise the dust and gas in the circumstellar environment of the extreme Galactic red supergiant \nmlcyg in terms of mass, morphology, and kinematics. Based on interferometric observations with NOEMA at 230 GHz we estimated dust masses and temperatures, and measured the extent and morphological complexity of the circumstellar environment. We detected two strong continuum components, amounting to an estimated total dust mass of $\sim2\times10^{-3}M_{\odot}$ located out to ~2000 AU from the star, largely beyond the dust detected at optical/infrared wavelengths. The extent of the detected CO emission supports the notion that the outflow is formed by a mass-loss rate of several $10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$/year and that it is not primarily shaped by extreme irradiation from the Cyg OB2 cluster it has been associated with. We have detected, but not resolved, previously unseen high-velocity components close to the star. The observations reveal a very complex circumstellar morphology and we propose that some of the detected components could be the imprint of a hitherto unknown binary companion.</p>

<p>Supernova remnants (SNRs) are often considered as the main sites of acceleration of cosmic rays in our Galaxy, possibly up to the knee. However, their ability to accelerate particles to reach PeV energies is questionable and lacks observational evidence. Theoretical predictions suggest that only a small subclass of very young SNRs evolving in dense environments could potentially satisfy the necessary conditions to accelerate particles to PeV energies. Most such theoretical investigations are carried out either in the standard interstellar medium or in the wind of the progenitor. Since most core collapse supernovae occur in star clusters, it is important to extend such investigation to SNRs taking place in a star cluster. In this work we focus on a SNR shock propagating in the collective wind of a compact star cluster, and we study the acceleration process as a function time, with special emphasis on the maximum energy of accelerated particles. Using both analytic and numerical approaches we investigate the spectrum of accelerated particles and maximum achievable energy in the case of pre-existing turbulence in the collective wind and self-generated magnetic perturbations. We find that similar to isolated SNRs, acceleration to PeV energies is plausible only for extreme conditions achievable only in a small subset of SNRs.</p>

<p>2025-05-05, <strong>An interferometric study of B star multiplicity</strong>, A. J. Frost et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02300v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.02300v1</a></p>

<p>Massive stars are extremely influential objects and multiplicity has the potential to dictate how they evolve over time by causing dynamical interactions, common-envelope evolution, mergers and more. While O-star multiplicity has been studied over a broad separation range, studies of B star multiplicity are lacking despite the fact that they dominate the production of core-collapse supernovae and neutron stars. We analyse interferometric data at high-angular resolution taken with PIONIER/VLTI for a sample of 32 B stars. Using parametric modelling of the closure phases and visibilities, we determine best-fit models to each of the systems and investigate whether each source is best represented by a single star or a higher-order system. Detection limits were calculated for companions to determine if they were significant. We then combined our findings from the interferometric data with results from a literature search to see if other companions were reported at different separation ranges. We find that, within the interferometric range, 72$\pm$8\% of the B stars are resolved as multiple systems. The most common type of system is a triple system, followed by binary systems, presumably single stars and then higher-order systems. The interferometric companion fraction derived for the sample is 1.88$\pm$0.24. When accounting for the spectroscopic companions confirmed in the literature and wide companions inferred from Gaia data in addition to companions we find with interferometry, multiplicity and companion fractions of 0.88$\pm$0.06 and 2.31$\pm$0.27 respectively are obtained for our sample. The number of triple systems in particular increases significantly when accounting for spectroscopic companions, suggesting that binarity and higher-order multiplicity are integral to the evolution of B stars, as they are for O stars.</p>
