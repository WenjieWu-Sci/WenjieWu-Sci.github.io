<p>In the present work, the scotogenic model is constructed applying non invertible $Z_M$ symmetries. The stability of dark matter and the scotogenic structure of the neutrino mass matrix is achieved via the new non-group symmetry. The non-group Scotogenic model is given with minimalistic content giving a one-zero structure of the neutrino mass matrix, and numerical analysis of the lepton mixing angles and physics are presented. Other relevant constraints are also studied.</p>

<p>The Pierre Auger Observatory consists of 1660 water-Cherenkov detectors (WCDs) and 27 fluorescence telescopes, covering a surface of 3000 km2 in the province of Mendoza, Argentina. After almost two decades, Auger Phase I has ended the data taking and has already delivered many outstanding physics results. The Auger Observatory is currently running in Phase II, with upgraded detectors for enhanced data of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). During Phase I, several engineering detectors were developed and tested. Some of those developments led to new detectors, which are now part of the upgraded Observatory. For Phase II, the WCDs were upgraded with a surface-scintillator detector, a radio detector, a small photomultiplier, and an upgraded electronics board, facilitating mass-sensitive measurements for source identification of UHECRs. Moreover, an underground muon detector allows for a direct measurement of the muon content of air showers. The Offline framework is the main software for the event reconstruction and detector simulation at the Pierre Auger Observatory. It is continuously being developed to accommodate changes in the detector and new algorithms. It allows the running of various applications, which are made up of individual modules, either on raw data or simulations on an event-by-event basis. Large productions of shower and detector reference libraries are done with CORSIKA 7 and Offline on the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI) using the Virtual Organization Auger. Various air-shower geometries (up to 89 degrees in zenith) were considered, as well as several primary particles (from light to ultra-heavy nuclei, photons, and neutrinos), hadronic interaction models and detector configurations for Phase I and Phase II. In this contribution, we present the actual efforts and updates on software for data production and reference Monte Carlo simulations for Auger data analysis.</p>

<p>2025-07-14, <strong>A Cost Effective Optimization of the hybrid-DOM Design for TRIDENT</strong>, Hengbin Shao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10256v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.10256v1</a></p>

<p>TRIDENT is a planned multi-cubic-kilometer deep-sea neutrino telescope to be built in the South China Sea, designed to rapidly discover high-energy astrophysical neutrino sources with sensitivity to all neutrino flavors. Achieving this at scale requires a detector design that balances performance with power, cost, and mechanical simplicity. This study presents a cost-effective optimization of TRIDENT’s hybrid Digital Optical Module (hDOM) design, comparing configurations using high-quantum-efficiency (QE) 3-inch PMTs and larger 4-inch PMTs, the latter evaluated with both baseline and enhanced QE assumptions. Using full-chain detector simulations incorporating site-specific seawater optical properties and realistic backgrounds, we assess performance in all-flavor neutrino detection efficiency, directional reconstruction, and tau neutrino flavor identification from 1 TeV to 10 PeV. We find that if 4-inch PMTs can achieve QE comparable to 3-inch PMTs, their performance matches or improves upon that of the 3-inch design, while significantly reducing channel count, power consumption, and cost. These findings support the 4-inch PMT hDOM as a promising and scalable choice for TRIDENT’s future instrumentation.</p>

<p>2025-07-14, <strong>Search for Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos at the Pierre Auger Observatory: New Triggers, Methods, and Constraints</strong>, Srijan Sehgal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10214v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.10214v1</a></p>

<p>The Pierre Auger Observatory has the capability to identify neutrino-induced extensive air showers above $10^{17}$ eV by using its large Surface Detector (SD) array. Data from the Observatory have been used to set some of the most stringent upper limits to the neutrino flux in the ultra-high energy (UHE) range. The data have also been used for follow-up detection of transient events in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics. In mid-2013, two additional SD triggers (Time-over-Threshold-deconvolved (ToTd) and Multiplicity-of-Positive Steps (MoPS)) were shown to increase the detection capability for the neutrino-induced air showers in the energy regime below $10^{19}$ eV by a factor of 5-10. This contribution will give an overview of the ongoing work regarding the searches for UHE neutrinos at the Pierre Auger Observatory. The impact of the ToTd and MoPS triggers for neutrino search in the zenith angle range of $60^{\circ} &lt; \theta &lt; 75^{\circ}$ is discussed. A novel neutrino identification method, which integrates these triggers, is applied to observational data to look for neutrino-like events using a $\textit{blind}$ search strategy. New constraints to point-like sources of UHE neutrinos will be presented for the angular range explored.</p>

<p>The central engine of gamma-ray burst is considered. Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process is reconsidered under the asymtotic magnetic condition ${\bf B}=B_0\hat{z}$ (rotation axis) at $r\gg r_H$. Another scenario of $\nu \overline{\nu} \to e^+ e^-$ driven jet are combined to BZ process to compliment it.</p>

<p>2025-07-13, <strong>Updated Earth Tomography Using Atmospheric Neutrinos at IceCube</strong>, Alex Wen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09763v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.09763v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed a sample of high purity, primarily atmospheric, muon neutrino events over 11 years from all directions below the horizon, spanning the energy range 500 GeV to 100 TeV. While this sample was initially used for an eV-scale sterile neutrino search, its purity and spanned parameter space can also be used to perform an earth tomography. This flux of neutrinos traverses the earth and is attenuated in varying amounts depending on the energy and traversed column density of the event. By parameterizing the earth as multiple constant–density shells, IceCube can measure the upgoing neutrino flux as a function of the declination, yielding an inference of the density of each shell. In this talk, the latest sensitivities of this analysis and comparisons with the previous measurement are presented. In addition, the analysis procedure, details about the data sample, and systematic effects are also explained. This analysis is one of the latest, weak-force driven, non-gravitational, measurements of the earth’s density and mass.</p>

<p>2025-07-13, <strong>Probing Right Handed Neutrino assisted Reheating with Gravitational Waves and Leptogenesis</strong>, Arghyajit Datta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09728v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.09728v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate a non-instantaneous reheating period in the early Universe, where the inflaton field decays exclusively to right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). The subsequent decay of these RHNs into Standard Model particles not only drives the transition to a radiation-dominated era but also generates the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. In this typical reheating scenario, gravitational waves (GWs) can be produced during inflaton decay, both through bremsstrahlung and inflaton scattering processes. While GW production via bremsstrahlung dominates near the end of the reheating phase, inflaton scattering leads to a non-negligible GW contribution near the maximum temperature of the Universe. The combined GW spectrum from both decay and scattering processes lies within the sensitivity range of proposed resonant cavity experiments. This framework thus offers a compelling and unified approach to addressing neutrino mass generation, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis, and probing the dynamics of a non-instantaneous reheating era.</p>

<p>2025-07-13, <strong>Chiral and flavor oscillations in quantum field theory</strong>, Massimo Blasone et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09645v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.09645v1</a></p>

<p>Massive fermions produced through weak charged interactions possess a definite chirality, which is not conserved during free propagation, leading to chiral oscillations. Neutrinos also exhibit flavor oscillations. These phenomena have been extensively studied - both individually and within a unified framework - using the first quantization approach, but only separately in the context of quantum field theory. In this work, we address this gap by developing a quantum field theory treatment of flavor-chiral oscillations. Focusing on the case of two-flavor mixing, we compute the expectation values of the (non-conserved) chiral-flavor charges and recover the same oscillation formulas obtained in the first quantization formalism. These charges are diagonalized via Bogoliubov transformations in both the chiral and flavor sectors. Such transformations reveal a non-trivial structure of the chiral-flavor vacuum, which consists of a condensate of particles with definite masses and helicities.</p>

<p>2025-07-13, <strong>Application of interpretable data-driven methods for the reconstruction of supernova neutrino energy spectra following fast neutrino flavor conversions</strong>, Haihao Shi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09632v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.09632v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinos can experience fast flavor conversions (FFCs) in highly dense astrophysical environments, such as core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, potentially affecting energy transport and other processes. The simulation of fast flavor conversions under realistic astrophysical conditions requires substantial computational resources and involves significant analytical challenges. While machine learning methods like Multilayer Perceptrons have been used to accurately predict the asymptotic outcomes of FFCs, their ‘black-box’ nature limits the extraction of direct physical insight. To address this limitation, we employ two distinct interpretable machine learning frameworks-Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)-to derive physically insightful models from a FFC simulation dataset. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between predictive accuracy and model simplicity. The KANs demonstrates high fidelity in reconstructing post-conversion neutrino energy spectra, achieving accuracies of up to $90\%$. In contrast, SINDy uncovers a remarkably concise, low-rank set of governing equations, offering maximum interpretability but with lower predictive accuracy. Critically, by analyzing the interpretable model, we identify the number density of heavy-lepton neutrinos as the most dominant factor in the system’s evolution. Ultimately, this work provides a methodological framework for interpretable machine learning that supports genuine data-driven physical discovery in astronomy and astrophysics, going beyond prediction alone.</p>

<p>2025-07-13, <strong>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) Collaboration – Contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025)</strong>, Jaime Álvarez-Muñiz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09585v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.09585v1</a></p>

<p>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned observatory of ultra-high-energy particles of cosmic origin, with energies in excess of 100 PeV. GRAND uses large surface arrays of antennas to look for the radio emission from extensive air showers that are triggered by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos in the atmosphere or underground. In particular, for ultra-high-energy neutrinos, the future final phase of GRAND aims to be sensitive enough to detect them in spite of their plausibly tiny flux. Three prototype GRAND radio arrays have been in operation since 2023: GRANDProto300, in China, GRAND@Auger, in Argentina, and GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay, in France. Their goals are to field-test the GRAND detection units, understand the radio background to which they are exposed, and develop tools for diagnostic, data gathering, and data analysis. This list of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025) presents an overview of GRAND, in its present and future incarnations, and a first look at data collected by GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger, including the first cosmic-ray candidates detected by them.</p>

<p>2025-07-14, <strong>Observational biases on rotation curves from IFU data at cosmic noon</strong>, Amanda E. de Araujo-Carvalho et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10544v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.10544v1</a></p>

<p>Through studying rotation curves, which depict how the velocity of the stars and gas changes with distance from the center of the galaxy, it has been confirmed that dark matter dominates galaxy’s outer regions, as their rotation curve remains flat. However, recent studies of star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon have shown a decline in their rotation curve beyond a certain point, suggesting a decrease of the abundance of dark matter in galactic halos during earlier times. In this work, we investigate the influence of cosmological surface brightness dimming and loss of resolution on observations of rotation curves at cosmic noon. We used a sample of 19 Lyman Break Analogs at $z \approx 0.2$ and artificially redshifted them as if they were at $z \approx 2.2$. By comparing both rotation curves of the observed and mocked objects, we find that the asymmetry of the cosmic noon galaxies is smaller than that of the low-$z$ galaxies. In low-$z$ galaxies, asymmetry increases with radius and becomes relevant at the external parts, where mergers and interactions cause more disturbance in the galaxy’s gravitational field. In contrast, cosmic-noon galaxies appear smoother, smaller, and suitable for dynamical modeling – when in reality, they are not. The combined effects of the cosmological bias and loss of resolution lead us to the conclusion that caution should be exercised when using cosmic-noon rotation curves, as they might not accurately trace the gravitational potential of the galaxy.</p>

<p>2025-07-14, <strong>Non-Gaussian Expansion of Minkowski Tensors in Redshift Space</strong>, Stephen Appleby et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10091v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.10091v1</a></p>

<p>This paper focuses on extending the use of Minkowski Tensors to analyze anisotropic signals in cosmological data, focusing on those introduced by redshift space distortion. We derive the ensemble average of the two translation-invariant, rank-2 Minkowski Tensors for a matter density field that is perturbatively non-Gaussian in redshift space. This is achieved through the Edgeworth expansion of the joint probability density function of the field and its derivatives, expressing the ensemble averages in terms of cumulants up to cubic order. Our goal is to connect these theoretical predictions to the underlying cosmological parameters, allowing for parameter estimation by measuring them from galaxy surveys. The work builds on previous analyses of Minkowski Functionals in both real and redshift space and addresses the effects of Finger-of-God velocity dispersion and shot noise. We validate our predictions by matching them to measurements of the Minkowski Tensors from dark matter simulation data, finding that perturbation theory is a qualified success. Non-perturbative Finger-of-God effects remain significant at relatively large scales (R&lt; 20 Mpc/h) and are particularly pronounced in the components parallel to the line of sight.</p>

<p>2025-07-13, <strong>Novel Challenges in Tracking Self-Interacting Dark Matter Subhalos</strong>, Demao Kong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09799v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.09799v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmological N-body simulations are among the primary tools for studying structure formation in the Universe. Analyses of these simulations critically depend on accurately identifying and tracking dark matter subhalos over time. In recent years, several new algorithms have been developed to improve the accuracy and consistency of subhalo tracking in cold dark matter simulations. These algorithms should be revisited in the context of new physics beyond gravity, which can modify the evolution and final properties of subhalo populations. In this work, we apply the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder Symfind to velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter simulations with large cross section amplitudes to assess the performance of particle-tracking methods beyond the CDM paradigm. We find that the core-particle-tracking technique, which is key to the success of these algorithms in CDM, does not always yield accurate results in SIDM. The interplay between dark matter self-interactions and tidal stripping can cause the diffusion of core particles to larger radii, leading particle-tracking-based algorithms to prematurely lose track of SIDM subhalos. For massive core-expansion subhalos and core-collapse subhalos that experience close or repeated pericentric passages, a significant fraction of core particles can be lost, and particle-tracking-based finders such as Symfind offer no clear advantage over traditional methods that rely on identifying phase-space overdensities. On the other hand, for subhalos with large pericentric distances or fewer, more distant passages, Symfind tends to outperform. These differences depend sensitively on the cross section amplitude and turnover velocity of the underlying SIDM model. We therefore recommend a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both techniques to produce complete and robust catalogs of core-expansion and core-collapse SIDM subhalos.</p>

<p>2025-07-13, <strong>The First Constraint on the Dark Matter Millicharge via Multimessenger Time-Delay Analysis of GRB GW170817A</strong>, Wenxing Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09623v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.09623v1</a></p>

<p>We derive new constraint on millicharged dark matter from the multimessenger observation of GW170817. In the neutron star merger event GW170817, the first detection of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) delayed by approximately 1.7 seconds relative to the gravitational wave emission was observed. Utilizing this delay, we constrain the millicharge parameter of dark matter within the large-scale structure of the Universe. {For dark matter mass below $10^{-15}$ eV, the millicharge parameter $\epsilon$ is constrained to be less than $10^{-14}$, representing the most stringent limits achieved to date.</p>

<p>2025-07-14, <strong>Investigating Galactic Fountains in M101: Insights from Ionized, UV emissions and Neutral Gas</strong>, Aashiya Anitha Shaji et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10549v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.10549v1</a></p>

<p>Spiral galaxy disks are thought to exist in a quasi-stationary state, between fresh gas accretion from cosmic filaments and disk star formation, self-regulated through supernovae feedback. Our goal here is to quantify these processes and probe their efficiency. While star formation can be traced at 10 Myr time-scales through H$\alpha$ emission, the signature of OB stars, and at 100 Myr scale with UV emission, the gas surface density is traced by HI emission for the atomic phase. We choose to investigate feedback processes using fountain effects in M101, a nearby well-observed face-on galaxy. Face-on studies are very complementary to the more frequent edge-on observations of these fountains in the literature. We use high-resolution data from THINGS for the HI emission GALEX for UV, and SITELLE/SIGNALS IFU for the H$\alpha$ tracer. We have identified 20 new HI holes, in addition to the 52 holes found by Kamphuis in 1993. We study in more detail the nine holes satisfying strong criteria to be true fountain effects, compute their physical properties, and derive their energy balance. Only one small HI hole still contains H$\alpha$ and young stars inside, while the largest hole of 2.4 kpc and oldest age (94 Myr) is deprived of H$\alpha$ and UV. For face-on disks, the possibility to study simultaneously the HI shell morphology, the stellar association, and kinematic evidence is of primordial importance. In M101, we have quantified how stellar feedback is responsible for carving the observed cavities in the atomic gas disk, and how it can expel above the disk the neutral gas, which is then unavailable for star formation during up to 100 Myr.</p>

<p>2025-07-14, <strong>Generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck approach to the thermodynamics of quark-hadron matter</strong>, David Blaschke et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10497v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.10497v1</a></p>

<p>We present a unified approach to the transition from hadronic matter to quark matter where hadrons are treated as bound states of quarks which dissociate at high densities due to quark Pauli blocking. The newly developed approach makes use of a cluster virial expansion formulated in terms of a generalized $\Phi$-derivable approach to multi-quark correlations with bound and continuum states in their spectrum encoded in hadron phase shifts. Our model can be used to obtain thermodynamic functions not only at zero and small chemical potentials, where they are consistent with lattice QCD simulations, but also at large chemical potentials where lattice QCD simulations have the sign problem. By applying a reaction-kinetic criterion for the chemical freeze-out of multi-quark clusters in heavy-ion collisions, we demonstrate that the chemical freeze-out coincides with their Mott transition. The approach can be applied to study the effects of the QCD transition on primordial black hole formation in the early Universe and on hybrid neutron star formation in supernova explosions and binary neutron star mergers.</p>

<p>The nuclear rates for reactions involving 12C and 16O are key to compute the energy release and nucleosynthesis of massive stars during their evolution. These rates shape the stellar structure and evolution, and impact the nature of the final compact remnant. We explore the impact of new nuclear reaction rates for 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O, 12C+12C, 12C+16O and 16O+16O reactions for massive stars. We aim to investigate how the structure and nucleosynthesis evolve and how these processes influence the stellar fate. We computed stellar models using the GENEC code, including updated rates for 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O and, for the three fusion reactions, new rates following a fusion suppression scenario and new theoretical rates obtained with TDHF calculations. The updated 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O rates mainly impact the chemical structure evolution changing the 12C/16O ratio with little effect on the CO core mass. This variation in the 12C/16O ratio is critical for predicting the stellar fate, which is very sensitive to 12C abundance. The combined new rates for 12C+12C and 16O+16O fusion reactions according to the HIN(RES) model lead to shorter C- and O-burning lifetimes, and shift the ignition conditions to higher temperatures and densities. Theoretical TDHF rates primarily affect C-burning, increasing its duration and lowering the ignition temperature. These changes alter the core chemical structure, the carbon shell size and duration, and hence the compactness. They also affect nucleosynthesis. This work shows that accurate reaction rates for key processes in massive star evolution drive significant changes in stellar burning lifetimes, chemical evolution, and stellar fate. In addition, discrepancies between experimental and theoretical rates introduce uncertainties in model predictions, influencing both the internal structure and the supernova ejecta composition.</p>

<p>2025-07-14, <strong>Anisotropy of core-collapse supernovae effected by AGN disks</strong>, Jiao-Zhen She et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10040v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.10040v1</a></p>

<p>Active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk provide dense environments to influence on the star formation, evolution, and migration. In AGN disks, pressure gradients and migration accelerations could create the anisotropy of the core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) when the massive stars explode at the end of their lives. In this study, we construct the equilibrium equations by considering the above two factors and then compute the light curves for three types of progenitor stars at different locations of AGN disks for the different supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, accretion efficiencies, explosion energies, and masses of ejecta. The results show that the migration acceleration has more significant effects on the anisotropic explosions than the pressure gradients of the AGN disks. The anisotropic luminosities are pronounced at large radii, and massive SMBHs would suppress the anisotropy and reduce the total luminosity.</p>

<p>Analyses by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration suggest a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model when their baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and various Type Ia supernova (SNIa) samples. In this work, we systematically investigate the origin of the deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM reported in recent cosmological analyses by combining different CMB datasets, BAO measurements, and DESY5 SNIa samples within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. We find that the DESY5 SNIa sample, particularly its low-redshift component (DES-lowz), the Planck CMB data, the lensing measurements of Planck and ACT-DR6, and the DESI-DR2 BAO measurements contribute most significantly to the observed tensions. In contrast, combinations involving DES-SN, WMAP, SPT, and ACT-DR6 remain consistent with $\Lambda$CDM within $\sim1\sigma$. Our results highlight the critical impact of SNIa systematics, CMB data, and the choice of BAO dataset on constraints of dynamical dark energy models. These findings underscore the importance of improved calibration, homogeneity, and cross-validation of observational datasets to robustly assess potential deviations from the standard cosmological model.</p>

<p>2025-07-14, <strong>Supernova-induced binary-interaction-powered supernovae: a model for SN2022jli</strong>, Ryosuke Hirai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09974v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.09974v1</a></p>

<p>We present 3D hydrodynamical modelling of supernova-induced binary-interaction-powered supernovae; a scenario proposed for the peculiar type Ic supernova SN2022jli. In this scenario, supernova ejecta of a stripped-envelope star impacts a close-by stellar companion, temporarily inflating the envelope. The expanded envelope engulfs the neutron star, causing strong mass accretion at super-Eddington rates. Feedback from the accretion powers the supernova light curve with periodic undulations. Our simulations capture key features of SN2022jli, both the overall decline and the superimposed undulations of the light curve. Based on our parameter study, we find that (i) the accretion feedback should be sufficiently geometrically confined and the eccentricity of the post-supernova binary orbit should be $0.7\lesssim e\lesssim0.9$ to sustain a high accretion rate, and (ii) the viewing angle should be close to edge-on to match the low undulation amplitude ($\Delta L/L\sim0.1$) of SN2022jli. Different combinations of parameters could account for other supernovae like SN2022mop, SN2009ip and SN2015ap. We also discuss possible explanations for other key features of SN2022jli such as the $\gamma$-ray detection at $\sim200~\mathrm{d}$ and the rapid optical drop at $\sim250~\mathrm{d}$. Finally, we speculate on the future evolution of the system and its relation to existing neutron star binaries.</p>
