<p>2023-10-10, <strong>MARES: A macroscopic approach to the radar echo scatter from high-energy particle cascades</strong>, E. Huesca Santiago et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06731v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06731v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we provide a macroscopic model to predict the radar echo signatures found when a radio signal is reflected from a cosmic-ray or neutrino-induced particle cascade propagating in a dense medium like ice. Its macroscopic nature allows for an energy independent runtime, taking less than 10 s for simulating a single scatter event. As a first application, we discuss basic signal properties and simulate the expected signal for the T-576 beam-test experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). We find good signal strength agreement with the only observed radar echo from a high-energy particle cascade to date.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>On the minimal mass of thermal dark matter and the viability of millicharged particles affecting 21cm cosmology</strong>, Xiaoyong Chu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06611v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06611v1</a></p>

<p>Thermal freeze-out offers an attractive explanation of the dark matter density free from fine-tuning of initial conditions. For dark matter with a mass below tens of MeV, photons, electrons, and neutrinos are the only available direct Standard Model annihilation products. Using a full three-sector abundance calculation, we determine the minimal mass of dark matter, allowing for an arbitrary branching into electrons/photons and neutrinos that is compatible with current cosmological observations. The analysis takes into account the heat transfer between the various sectors from annihilation and elastic scattering, representing the first fully self-consistent analysis that tracks the respective sectors’ temperatures. We thereby provide accurate thermal annihilation cross sections, particularly for velocity-dependent cases, and deduce the sensitivity of current and upcoming CMB experiments to MeV thermal dark matter. In the latter context, we also establish the fine-tuned parameter region where a tiny admixture of neutrinos in the final states rules in MeV-scale $p$-wave annihilating DM into electrons. Finally, we show that a sub-% millicharged dark matter with an interaction strength that interferes with 21~cm cosmology is still allowed when freeze-out is supplemented with annihilation into neutrinos. For all cases considered, we provide concrete particle physics models and supplement our findings with a discussion of other relevant experimental results.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>A tolerable candle: the low-$ν$ method with LHC neutrinos</strong>, Callum Wilkinson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06520v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06520v1</a></p>

<p>The Forward Physics Facility (FPF) plans to use neutrinos produced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to make a variety of measurements at previously unexplored TeV energies. Its primary goals include precision measurements of the neutrino cross section and using the measured neutrino flux both to uncover information about far-forward hadron production and to search for various beyond standard model scenarios. However, these goals have the potential to conflict: extracting information about the flux or cross section relies upon an assumption about the other. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that the FPF can use the low-$\nu$ method – a technique for constraining the flux shape by isolating neutrino interactions with low energy transfer to the nucleus – to break this degeneracy. We show that the low-$\nu$ method is effective for extracting the $\nu_{\mu}$ flux shape, in a model-independent way. We discuss its application for extracting the $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ flux shape, but find that this is significantly more model dependent. Finally, we explore the precision to which the $\nu_{\mu}$ flux shape could be constrained at the FPF, for a variety of proposed detector options. We find that the precision would be sufficient to discriminate between various realistic flux models.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>Phase space of electron- and muon-neutrino and antineutrino scattering off nuclei</strong>, M. Martini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06388v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06388v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the electron and muon neutrino and antineutrino charged current quasielastic double differential cross sections on carbon by projecting them in the transferred momentum-energy plane. This visually allows to easily understand the surprising dominance of the muon neutrino and antineutrino cross sections over the electron ones in particular kinematical conditions.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>First attempt of directionality reconstruction for atmospheric neutrinos in a large homogeneous liquid scintillator detector</strong>, Zekun Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06281v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06281v1</a></p>

<p>The directionality information of incoming neutrinos is essential to atmospheric neutrino oscillation analysis since it is directly related to the oscillation baseline length. Large homogeneous liquid scintillator detectors, while offering excellent energy resolution, are traditionally very limited in their capabilities of measuring event directionality. In this paper, we present a novel directionality reconstruction method for atmospheric neutrino events in large homogeneous liquid scintillator detectors based on waveform analysis and machine learning techniques. We demonstrate for the first time that such detectors can achieve good direction resolution and potentially play an important role in future atmospheric neutrino oscillation measurements.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>EUSO-SPB2 Fluorescence Telescope Calibration and Field Tests</strong>, Viktoria Kungel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06209v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06209v1</a></p>

<p>The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2), successfully launched from Wanaka, New Zealand on May 13, 2022, is a precursor for a space-based astroparticle observatory such as the Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA). EUSO-SPB2 flew two custom telescopes. Both have UV/UV-visible sensitivity and feature Schmidt optics. The Fluorescence Telescope (FT) measures ultra-high energy cosmic rays by looking down. The \v{C}erenkov Telescope (CT) searches for neutrino signatures by looking toward Earth’s limb. The two telescopes each have a 1 m diameter entrance pupil and segmented glass mirrors that collect light from extensive air showers at the PeV and EeV-scale. Here we describe the FT telescope optics together with the results of the FT field tests at the Utah Telescope Array (TA) site from August/September 2022. The FT recorded the night sky background, lasers, and artificial point sources. The field tests included an absolute photometric calibration of the FT telescope that is compared to a piece-wise laboratory calibration.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>Experimental neutrino physics in a nuclear landscape</strong>, D. S. Parno et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06207v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06207v1</a></p>

<p>There are profound connections between neutrino physics and nuclear experiments. Exceptionally precise measurements of single and double beta-decay spectra illuminate the scale and nature of neutrino mass and may finally answer the question of whether neutrinos are their own antimatter counterparts. Neutrino-nucleus scattering underpins oscillation experiments and probes nuclear structure, neutrinos offer a rare vantage point into collapsing stars and nuclear fission reactors, and techniques pioneered in neutrino nuclear-physics experiments are advancing quantum-sensing technologies. In this article, we review current and planned efforts at the intersection of neutrino and nuclear experiments.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>Measurement of nuclear effects in neutrino-argon interactions using generalized kinematic imbalance variables with the MicroBooNE detector</strong>, MicroBooNE collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06082v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06082v1</a></p>

<p>We present a set of new generalized kinematic imbalance variables that can be measured in neutrino scattering. These variables extend previous measurements of kinematic imbalance on the transverse plane, and are more sensitive to modeling of nuclear effects. We demonstrate the enhanced power of these variables using simulation, and then use the MicroBooNE detector to measure them for the first time. We report flux-integrated single- and double-differential measurements of charged-current muon neutrino scattering on argon using a topolgy with one muon and one proton in the final state as a function of these novel kinematic imbalance variables. These measurements allow us to demonstrate that the treatment of charged current quasielastic interactions in GENIE version 2 is inadequate to describe data. Further, they reveal tensions with more modern generator predictions particularly in regions of phase space where final state interactions are important.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>Forecast Cosmological Constraints with the 1D Wavelet Scattering Transform and the Lyman-$α$ forest</strong>, Hurum Tohfa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06010v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06010v1</a></p>

<p>We make forecasts for the constraining power of the 1D Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) in the context of Lyman-$\alpha$ forest cosmology. Using mock simulations and a Fisher matrix, we show that there is considerable cosmological information in the scattering transform coefficients. We estimate mock covariance matrices assuming uncorrelated Gaussian pixel noise for each quasar, at a level drawn from a simple lognormal model. The extra information comes from a smaller estimated covariance in the first-order wavelet power, and from second-order wavelet coefficients which probe non-Gaussian information in the forest. Forecast constraints on cosmological parameters from the WST are as much as an order of magnitude tighter than for the power spectrum. Should these constraints be confirmed on real data, it would substantially improve cosmological constraints on, for example, neutrino mass.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>Migdal effect of Phonon-mediated neutrino nucleus scattering in semiconductor detectors</strong>, Yu-Feng Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05704v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.05704v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we introduce the theoretical framework of the phonon-mediated Migdal effect for neutrino-nucleus scattering in semiconductors, considering both the Standard Model and the presence of the neutrino magnetic moment. We calculate the rate of electron excitation resulting from the Migdal effect and observe a substantial coherent enhancement compared to ordinary neutrino-electron scattering. Furthermore, we provide numerical sensitivities for detecting the Migdal effect and constraints on the neutrino magnetic moment, utilizing an experimental setup with reactor neutrinos.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>CONGRuENTS (COsmic-ray, Neutrino, Gamma-ray and Radio Non-Thermal Spectra). II. Population-level correlations between galactic infrared, radio, and γ-ray emission</strong>, Matt A. Roth et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05693v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.05693v1</a></p>

<p>Galaxies obey a number of empirical correlations between their radio, {\gamma}-ray, and infrared emission, but the physical origins of these correlations remain uncertain. Here we use the CONGRuENTS model for broadband non-thermal emission from star-forming galaxies, which self-consistently calculates energy-dependent transport and non-thermal emission from cosmic ray hadrons and leptons, to predict radio and {\gamma}-ray emission for a synthetic galaxy population with properties drawn from a large deep-field survey. We show that our synthetic galaxies reproduce observed relations such as the FIR-radio correlation, the FIR-{\gamma} correlation, and the distribution of radio spectral indices, and we use the model to explain the physical origins of these relations. Our results show that the FIR-radio correlation arises because the amount of cosmic ray electron power ultimately radiated as synchrotron emission varies only weakly with galaxy star formation rate as a result of the constraints imposed on gas properties by hydrostatic balance and turbulent dynamo action; the same physics dictates the extent of proton calorimetry in different galaxies, and thus sets the FIR-{\gamma}-ray correlation. We further show that galactic radio spectral indices result primarily from competition between thermal free-free emission and energy-dependent loss of cosmic ray electrons to bremsstrahlung and escape into galactic halos, with shaping of the spectrum by inverse Compton, synchrotron, and ionisation processes typically playing a sub-dominant role. In addition to explaining existing observations, we use our analysis to predict a heretofore unseen correlation between the curvature of galaxies’ radio spectra and their pion-driven {\gamma}-ray emission, a prediction that will be testable with upcoming facilities.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>Light Thermal Self-Interacting Dark Matter in the Shadow of Non-Standard Cosmology</strong>, Shu-Yu Ho et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05676v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.05676v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we construct a viable model for a GeV scale self-interacting dark matter (DM), where the DM was thermally produced in the early universe. In this model, a new vector-like fermion with a dark charge under the $U(1)_{D}$ gauge symmetry serves as a secluded WIMP DM and it can dominantly annihilate into the light dark gauge boson and singlet scalar through the dark gauge interaction. Also, the self-interaction of DM is induced by the light dark gauge boson via the same gauge interaction. In addition to these particles, we further introduce two Weyl fermions and a doublet scalar, by which the dark gauge boson produced from $s$-wave DM annihilations can mostly decay into active neutrinos after the dark symmetry breaking such that the CMB bound on the DM with low masses can be eluded. In order to have a common parameter region to explain the observed relic abundance and self-interaction of DM, we also study this model in a non-standard cosmological evolution, where the cosmic expansion driven by a new field species is faster than the standard radiation-dominated universe during the frozen time of DM. Reversely, one can also use the self-interacting nature of light thermal DM to examine the non-standard cosmological history of the universe.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>Transverse Emittance Reduction in Muon Beams by Ionization Cooling</strong>, MICE Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05669v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.05669v1</a></p>

<p>Accelerated muon beams have been considered for next-generation studies of high-energy lepton-antilepton collisions and neutrino oscillations. However, high-brightness muon beams have not yet been produced. The main challenge for muon acceleration and storage stems from the large phase-space volume occupied by the beam, derived from the muon production mechanism through the decay of pions from proton collisions. Ionization cooling is the technique proposed to decrease the muon beam phase-space volume. Here we demonstrate a clear signal of ionization cooling through the observation of transverse emittance reduction in beams that traverse lithium hydride or liquid hydrogen absorbers in the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE). The measurement is well reproduced by the simulation of the experiment and the theoretical model. The results shown here represent a substantial advance towards the realization of muon-based facilities that could operate at the energy and intensity frontiers.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>Recent results of cosmic-ray studies with IceTop at the IceCube Neutrino</strong>, Donghwa Kang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05614v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.05614v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer Cherenkov detector that is deployed deep in the Antarctic ice at the South Pole. A square kilometer companion surface detector, IceTop, located directly above in the in-ice array, measures cosmic-ray initiated extensive air showers with primary energies between 100 TeV and 1 EeV. By combining the events measured by IceTop and the in-ice detectors of IceCube in coincidence, we can reconstruct the energy spectra for different primary mass groups. Therefore, we provide information about the origin of cosmic rays, in particular, in the transition region from galactic to extra-galactic origin of high-energy cosmic rays. In this contribution we present recent experimental results, as well as prospects by the foreseen enhancement of the surface detectors of IceTop and the future IceCube-Gen2 surface array.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>Measurement of the muon flux at the SND@LHC experiment</strong>, SND@LHC Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05536v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.05536v1</a></p>

<p>The Scattering and Neutrino Detector at the LHC (SND@LHC) is a compact standalone experiment, which started taking data at the beginning of Run 3 of the LHC. The experiment is designed to perform measurements with neutrinos produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC in an energy range between 100 GeV and 1 TeV, and a previously unexplored pseudo-rapidity range of $7.2&lt;\eta&lt;8.4$. The detector, located 480 m downstream of the ATLAS interaction point in the TI18 tunnel, comprises a veto system followed by an 830 kg target mass consisting of tungsten plates, interleaved with nuclear emulsion plates and Scintillating Fiber (SciFi) electronic trackers, and then a calorimeter and a downstream muon system (DS). The measurement of the muon flux in the TI18 tunnel using the nuclear emulsion tracker and the electronic detectors, SciFi tracker and downstream muon detector, is reported here. The muon flux per integrated luminosity through an 18$\times$18 cm$^{2}$ area in the emulsions is $1.5 \pm 0.1(\textrm{stat}) \times 10^4\,\textrm{fb/cm}^{2}$. The measured muon flux per integrated luminosity through a 31$\times$31 cm$^{2}$ central SciFi area is $2.06\pm0.01(\textrm{stat})\pm0.12(\textrm{sys}) \times 10^{4}\,\textrm{fb/cm}^{2}$, while for the downstream muon system the flux is $2.35\pm0.01(\textrm{stat})\pm0.10(\textrm{sys}) \times 10^{4}\,\textrm{fb/cm}^{2}$ for a 52$\times$52 cm$^{2}$ central detector region. The total relative uncertainty of the electronic detectors measurements is 6 $\%$ for the SciFi and 4 $\%$ for the DS measurement. The Monte Carlo simulation prediction of these fluxes is 20$-$25 $\%$ lower than the measured values.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>How much do neutrinos live and weigh?</strong>, Federica Pompa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05474v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.05474v1</a></p>

<p>The next-generation water Cherenkov Hyper-Kamiokande detector will be able to detect thousands of neutrino events from a galactic Supernova explosion via Inverse Beta Decay processes followed by neutron capture on Gadolinium. This superb statistics provides a unique window to set bounds on neutrino properties, as its mass and lifetime. We shall explore the capabilities of such a future detector, constraining the former two properties via the time delay and the flux suppression induced in the Supernovae neutrino time and energy spectra. Special attention will be devoted to the statistically sub-dominant elastic scattering induced events, normally neglected, which can substantially improve the neutrino mass bound via time delays. When allowing for a invisible decaying scenario, the $95\%~$C.L. lower bound on $\tau/m$ is almost one order of magnitude better than the one found with SN1987A neutrino events. Simultaneous limits can be set on both $m_\nu$ and $\tau_{\nu}$, combining the neutrino flux suppression with the time-delay signature: the best constrained lifetime is that of $\nu_1$, which has the richest electronic component. We find $\tau_{\nu_1}\gtrsim 4\times 10^5~$s at $95\%~$C.L. The tightest $95\%~$C.L. bound on the neutrino mass we find is $0.34~$eV, which is not only competitive with the tightest neutrino mass limits nowadays, but also comparable to future laboratory direct mass searches. Both mass and lifetime limits are independent on the mass ordering, which makes our results very robust and relevant.</p>

<p>The f'eeton is the gauge boson of the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge theory. If the gauge coupling constant is extremely small, it becomes a candidate for dark matter. We show that its decay to a pair of electron and positron explains the observed Galactic 511-keV gamma-ray excess in a consistent manner. This f'eeton dark matter decays mainly into pairs of neutrino and anti-neutrino. Future low-energy experiments with improved directional capability make it possible to capture those neutrino signals. The seesaw-motivated parameter space predicts a relatively short f'eeton lifetime comparable to the current cosmological constraint.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>Identifying axion conversion in compact star magnetospheres with radio-wave polarization signatures</strong>, Z. H. Xue et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06660v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06660v1</a></p>

<p>The axion is well motivated in physics. It solves the strong charge conjugation-parity reversal problem CP in fundamental physics and the dark matter problem in astronomy. Its interaction with the electromagnetic field has been expected but never detected experimentally. Such particles may convert to radio waves in the environment with a strong magnetic field. Inspired by the idea, various research groups have been working on theoretical modeling and radio data analysis to search for the signature of radio signals generated by the axion conversion in the magnetosphere of compact stars, where the surface magnetic field as strong as $10^{13}$-$10^{14}$ G is expected. In this work, we calculate the observational properties of the axion-induced radio signals (AIRSs) in the neutron star magnetosphere, where both the total intensity and polarization properties of radio emission are derived. Based on the ray tracing method, assuming 100% linear polarization of radio waves generated in each conversion, we compute the polarization emission profile concerning different viewing angles. We note that plasma and general relativistic effects are important for the polarization properties of AIRSs. Our work suggests that AIRSs can be identified by the narrow bandwidth and distinct polarization features.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>Precision Muon-Related Observables as a Tool to Constrain New Physics Models</strong>, Gabriel Lourenço et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06642v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06642v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a set of precision muon-related observables that serve as a tool to constrain new physics models. Using LEP’s precision measurements on the $Z$-boson pole, we derive bounds on the new physics quantum contributions to the decay $Z \to \mu^+ \mu^-$. We show that the new precision observables have a real impact on two specific models that solve the $g-2$ anomaly and provide a sound dark matter candidate.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>A smoking gun signature of the 3HDM</strong>, A. Dey et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06593v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06593v1</a></p>

<p>We analyse new signals of a 3-Higgs Doublet Model (3HDM) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) where only one doublet acquires a Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV), preserving a $Z_2$ parity. The other two doublets are \textit{inert} and do not develop a VEV, leading to a \textit{dark scalar sector} controlled by $Z_2$, with the lightest CP-even dark scalar $H_1$ being the Dark Matter (DM) candidate. This leads to the loop induced decay of the next-to-lightest scalar, $H_2 \to H_1 \ell \bar \ell $ ($\ell =e,\mu$), mediated by both dark CP-odd neutral and charged scalars. This is a smoking-gun signal of the 3HDM since it is not allowed in the 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) with one inert doublet and is expected to be important when $H_2$ and $H_1$ are close in mass. In practice, this signature can be observed in the cascade decay of the SM-like Higgs boson, $h\to H_1 H_2\to H_1 H_1 \ell \bar \ell$ into two DM particles and di-leptons or $h\to H_2 H_2\to H_1 H_1 \ell \bar \ell \ell \bar \ell$ into two DM particles and four-leptons, where $h$ is produced from gluon-gluon Fusion. In order to test the feasibility of these channels at the LHC, we devise some benchmarks, compliant with collider, DM and cosmological data, for which the interplay between these production and decay modes is discussed. In particular, we show that the resulting detector signatures, $\Et \ell \bar \ell$ or $\Et \ell \bar \ell \ell \bar \ell$, with the invariant mass of $ \ell \bar \ell$ pairs much smaller than $m_Z$, can potentially be extracted already from Run 3 data and at the High-Luminosity phase of the LHC.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>Probing Bosonic Overdensities with Optomechanical Sensing</strong>, Katherine Slattery et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06494v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06494v1</a></p>

<p>Previous work has shown that optomechanical force sensing can be used for efficient detection of ultralight (sub-eV) dark matter candidates. We propose to extend the reach of this method to the search for ultralight dark matter in gravitationally-bound configurations in the Milky Way. We consider three scenarios, each strongly-motivated by previous studies: boson stars traveling in the galaxy with virial velocity; a bosonic halo centered around the Sun (a `solar halo’); and a bosonic halo centered around the Earth. For each case, we consider bound states composed of either scalar particles with a Yukawa coupling, or vector particles coupled to baryon minus lepton number charge. Accounting for all experimental constraints on coupling strength, we estimate the sensitivity reach of an optomechanical sensor search. We conclude that, although boson star encounters with Earth would be too infrequent to be detected in the relevant parameter space, current optomechanical force sensing technologies provide promising search capabilities for solar or Earth-bound halos.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>First direction sensitive search for dark matter with a nuclear emulsion detector at a surface site</strong>, Atsuhiro Umemoto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06265v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06265v1</a></p>

<p>Fine-grained nuclear emulsion films have been developed as a tracking detector with nanometric spatial resolution to be used in direction-sensitive dark matter searches, thanks to novel readout technologies capable of exploiting this unprecedented resolution. Emulsion detectors are time insensitive. Therefore, a directional dark matter search with such detector requires the use of an equatorial telescope to absorb the Earth rotation effect. We have conducted for the first time a directional dark matter search in an unshielded location, at the sea level, by keeping an emulsion detector exposed for 39 days on an equatorial telescope. The observed angular distribution of the data collected during an exposure equivalent to 0.59 g days agrees with the background model and an exclusion plot was then derived in the dark matter mass and cross-section plane: cross-sections higher than 1.1 $\times$10$^{-28}$ cm$^{2}$ and $1.1 \times 10^{-31}$ cm$^2$ were excluded for a dark matter mass of $10$ GeV$/c^2$ and $100$ GeV$/c^2$, respectively. This is the first direction sensitive search for dark matter with a solid-state, particle tracking detector.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>Rescuing Gravitational-Reheating in Chaotic Inflation</strong>, Basabendu Barman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06039v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06039v1</a></p>

<p>We show, within the single-field inflationary paradigm, that a linear non-minimal interaction $\xi\,M_P\,\phi\,R$ between the inflaton field $\phi$ and the Ricci scalar $R$ can result in successful inflation that concludes with an efficient heating of the Universe via perturbative decays of the inflaton, aided entirely by gravity. Considering the inflaton field to oscillate in a quadratic potential, we find that $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1}) \lesssim \xi \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^2)$ is required to satisfy the observational bounds from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Interestingly, the upper bound on the non-minimal coupling guarantees a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \gtrsim 10^{-4}$, within the range of current and future planned experiments. We also discuss implications of dark matter production, along with the potential generation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry resulting from inflaton decay, through the same gravity portal.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>Isospectrality breaking in the Teukolsky formalism</strong>, Dongjun Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06033v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06033v1</a></p>

<p>General relativity, though the most successful theory of gravity, has been continuously modified to resolve its incompatibility with quantum mechanics and explain the origin of dark energy or dark matter. One way to test these modified gravity theories is to study the gravitational waves emitted during the ringdown of binary mergers, which consist of quasinormal modes. In several modified gravity theories, the even- and odd-parity gravitational perturbations of non-rotating and slowly rotating black holes have different quasinormal mode frequencies, breaking the isospectrality of general relativity. For black holes with arbitrary spin in modified gravity, there were no avenues to compute quasinormal modes except numerical relativity, until recent extensions of the Teukolsky formalism. In this work, we describe how to use the modified Teukolsky formalism to study isospectrality breaking in modified gravity. We first introduce how definite-parity modes are defined through combinations of Weyl scalars in general relativity, and then, we extend this definition to modified gravity. We then use the eigenvalue perturbation method to show how the degeneracy in quasinormal mode frequencies of different parity is broken in modified gravity. To demonstrate our analysis, we also apply it to some specific modified gravity theories. Our work lays the foundation for studying isospectrality breaking of quasinormal modes in modified gravity for black holes with arbitrary spin.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>Riding the dark matter wave: Novel limits on general dark photons from LISA Pathfinder</strong>, Jonas Frerick et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06017v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06017v1</a></p>

<p>We note the possibility to perform a parametrically improved search for gauged baryon ($B$) and baryon minus lepton ($B-L$) Dark Photon Dark Matter (DPDM) using auxiliary channel data from LISA Pathfinder. In particular we use the measurement of the differential movement between the test masses (TMs) and the space craft (SC) which is nearly as sensitive as the tracking between the two TMs. TMs and SC are made from different materials and therefore have different charge-to-mass ratios for both $B-L$ and $B$. Thus, the surrounding DPDM field induces a relative acceleration of nearly constant frequency. For the case of $B-L$, we find that LISA Pathfinder can constrain previously unexplored parameter space, providing the world leading limits in the mass range $4\cdot 10^{-19}\,\text{eV}&lt;m&lt;3\cdot 10^{-17}\,\text{eV}$. This limit can easily be recast also for dark photons that arise from gauging other global symmetries of the SM.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>A Leptonic ALP Portal to the Dark Sector</strong>, Giovanni Armando et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05827v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.05827v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the leptonic ALP portal as a simple scenario that connects observed discrepancies in anomalous magnetic moments to the Dark Matter relic abundance. In this framework an axion-like particle in the multi-MeV range couples to SM leptons and a DM fermion, with mass above the ALP mass but below a GeV. The ALP contributes to $(g-2)_\mu$ and $(g-2)_e$ dominantly through 2-loop Barr-Zee diagrams, while the DM abundance is generated by $p$-wave annihilation to ALP pairs. Constraints from beam-dump experiments, colliders and CMB probes are very stringent, and restrict the viable parameter space to a rather narrow region that will be tested in the near future.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>Light Dark Matter Search Using a Diamond Cryogenic Detector</strong>, CRESST Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05815v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.05815v1</a></p>

<p>Diamond operated as a cryogenic calorimeter is an excellent target for direct detection of low-mass dark matter candidates. Following the realization of the first low-threshold cryogenic detector that uses diamond as absorber for astroparticle physics applications, we now present the resulting exclusion limits on the elastic spin-independent interaction cross-section of dark matter with diamond. We measured two 0.175 g CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) diamond samples, each instrumented with a W-TES. Thanks to the energy threshold of just 16.8 eV of one of the two detectors, we set exclusion limits on the elastic spin-independent interaction of dark matter particles with carbon nuclei down to dark matter masses as low as 0.122 GeV/c2. This work shows the scientific potential of cryogenic detectors made from diamond and lays the foundation for the use of this material as target for direct detection dark matter experiments.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>Dynamics of viable $f(R)$ dark energy models in the presence of Curvature-Matter interactions</strong>, Anirban Chatterjee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05578v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.05578v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, we analyze the dynamics of the interaction between dark matter and curvature-driven dark energy in viable $f(R)$ gravity models using the framework of dynamical system analysis. We incorporate this interaction by introducing a source term in their respective continuity equations, given by $Q = \frac{\kappa^2 \alpha}{3H}\tilde{\rho}_{\rm m}\rho_{\rm curv}$, and examine two $f(R)$ gravity models that comply with local gravity constraints and cosmological viability criteria. Our findings reveal subtle modifications to fixed points and their stability criteria when compared to the conventional dynamical analysis of $f(R)$ gravity models without matter-curvature interactions as proposed and examined in prior literature. We determine the parameter limits associated with the stability criteria of critical points of the dynamical system for both the models. Additionally, the introduction of interaction reveals variations in the dynamical aspects of cosmic evolution, contingent on the range of values for the relevant model parameters. These results are consistent with the observed features of cosmic evolution within specific limits of the $f(R)$ models parameters and the coupling parameter $\alpha$. We also examine the evolutionary dynamics of the universe in the interacting scenario, in the context of cosmological and cosmographic parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that the interacting scenario comprehensively accounts for all the observed phases of the universe’s evolution and also results in a stable late-time cosmic acceleration. Furthermore, we have examined the impact of the coupling parameter on the evolutionary dynamics, specifically in terms of its influence on the evolution of the matter-to-curvature energy density ratio.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>SN 2020zbf: A fast-rising hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova with strong carbon lines</strong>, A. Gkini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06814v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06814v1</a></p>

<p>SN 2020zbf is a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova at $z = 0.1947$ that shows conspicuous C II features at early times, in contrast to the majority of H-poor SLSNe. Its peak magnitude is $M_{\rm g}$ = $-21.2$ mag and its rise time ($\lesssim 24$ days from first light) place SN 2020zbf among the fastest rising SLSNe-I. Spectra taken from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared wavelengths are used for the identification of spectral features. We pay particular attention to the C II lines as they present distinctive characteristics when compared to other events. We also analyze UV and optical photometric data, and model the light curves considering three different powering mechanisms: radioactive decay of Ni, magnetar spin-down and circumstellar material interaction (CSM). The spectra of SN 2020zbf match well with the model spectra of a C-rich low-mass magnetar model. This is consistent with our light curve modelling which supports a magnetar-powered explosion with a $M_{\rm ej}$ = 1.5 $M_\odot$. However, we cannot discard the CSM-interaction model as it also may reproduce the observed features. The interaction with H-poor, carbon-oxygen CSM near peak could explain the presence of C II emission lines. A short plateau in the light curve, around 30 - 40 days after peak, in combination with the presence of an emission line at 6580 \r{A} can also be interpreted as late interaction with an extended H-rich CSM. Both the magnetar and CSM interaction models of SN 2020zbf indicate that the progenitor mass at the time of explosion is between 2 - 5 $M_\odot$. Modelling the spectral energy distribution of the host reveals a host mass of 10$^{8.7}$ $M_\odot$, a star-formation rate of 0.24$^{+0.41}_{-0.12}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and a metallicity of $\sim$ 0.4 $Z_\odot$.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>A convenient approach to characterizing model uncertainty with application to early dark energy solutions of the Hubble tension</strong>, S. Paradiso et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06747v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06747v1</a></p>

<p>Despite increasingly precise observations and sophisticated theoretical models, the discrepancy between measurements of H0 from the cosmic microwave background or from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations combined with Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis versus those from local distance ladder probes – commonly known as the $H_0$ tension – continues to perplex the scientific community. To address this tension, Early Dark Energy (EDE) models have been proposed as alternatives to $\Lambda$CDM, as they can change the observed sound horizon and the inferred Hubble constant from measurements based on this. In this paper, we investigate the use of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to evaluate EDE as a solution to the H0 tension. BMA consists of assigning a prior to the model and deriving a posterior as for any other unknown parameter in a Bayesian analysis. BMA can be computationally challenging in that one must approximate the joint posterior of both model and parameters. Here we present a computational strategy for BMA that exploits existing MCMC software and combines model-specific posteriors post-hoc. In application to a comprehensive analysis of cosmological datasets, we quantify the impact of EDE on the H0 discrepancy. We find an EDE model probability of $\sim$90% whenever we include the H0 measurement from Type Ia Supernovae in the analysis, whereas the other data show a strong preference for the standard cosmological model. We finally present constraints on common parameters marginalized over both cosmological models. For reasonable priors on models with and without EDE, the H0 tension is reduced by at least 20%.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>On the optical transients from double white-dwarf mergers</strong>, M. F. Sousa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06655v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06655v1</a></p>

<p>Double white-dwarf (DWD) mergers are relevant astrophysical sources expected to produce massive, highly-magnetized WDs, supernovae (SNe) Ia, and neutron stars (NSs). Although they are expected to be numerous sources in the sky, their detection has evaded the most advanced transient surveys. This article characterizes the optical transient expected from DWD mergers in which the central remnant is a stable (sub-Chandrasekhar) WD. We show that the expansion and cooling of the merger’s dynamical ejecta lead to an optical emission peaking at $1$-$10$ d post-merger, with luminosities of $10^{40}$-$10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We present simulations of the light-curves, spectra, and the color evolution of the transient. We show that these properties, together with the estimated rate of mergers, are consistent with the absence of detection, e.g., by The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). More importantly, we show that the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will likely detect a few/several hundred per year, opening a new window to the physics of WDs, NSs, and SN Ia.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>Multi-wavelength observations of multiple eruptions of the recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a</strong>, Judhajeet Basu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06586v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06586v1</a></p>

<p>We report the optical, UV, and soft X-ray observations of the $2017-2022$ eruptions of the recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a. We infer a steady decrease in the accretion rate over the years based on the inter-eruption recurrence period. We find a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cusp'' feature in the $r'$ and $i'$ band light curves close to the peak, which could be associated to jets. Spectral modelling indicates a mass ejection of 10$^{-7}$ to 10$^{-8}$ M$\_{\odot}$ during each eruption, and an enhanced Helium abundance of He/He$\_{\odot}$ $\approx$ 3. The super-soft source (SSS) phase shows significant variability, which is anti-correlated to the UV emission, indicating a common origin. The variability could be due to the reformation of the accretion disk. A comparison of the accretion rate with different models on the $\rm M\_{WD}$$-\dot{M}$ plane yields the mass of a CO WD, powering the</code>H-shell flashes’’ every $\sim$ 1 year to be $&gt;1.36$ M$_{\odot}$ and growing with time, making M31N 2008-12a a strong candidate for the single degenerate scenario of Type Ia supernovae progenitor.</p>

<p>2023-10-10, <strong>Discovering neutron stars with LISA via measurements of orbital eccentricity in Galactic binaries</strong>, Christopher J. Moore et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06568v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06568v1</a></p>

<p>LISA will detect $\sim ! 10^4$ Galactic binaries, the majority being double white dwarfs. However, approximately $\sim ! 1 \textrm{–} 5 \%$ of these systems will contain neutron stars which, if they can be correctly identified, will provide new opportunities for studying binary evolution pathways involving mass reversal and supernovae as well as being promising targets for multi-messenger observations. Eccentricity, expected from neutron star natal kicks, will be a key identifying signature for binaries containing a neutron star. Eccentric binaries radiate at widely-spaced frequency harmonics that must first be identified as originating from a single source and then analysed coherently. A multi-harmonic heterodyning approach for this type of data analysis is used to perform Bayesian parameter estimation on a range of simulated eccentric LISA signals. This is used to: (i) investigate LISA’s ability to measure orbital eccentricity and to quantify the minimum detectable eccentricity; (ii) demonstrate how eccentricity and periastron precession help to break the mass degeneracy allowing the individual component masses to be inferred, potentially confirming the presence of a neutron star; (iii) investigate the possibility of source misidentification when the individual harmonics of an eccentric binary masquerade as separate circular binaries; and (iv) investigate the possibility of source reclassification, where parameter estimation results of multiple circular analyses are combined in postprocessing to quickly infer the parameters of an eccentric source. The broader implications of this for the ongoing design of the LISA global fit are also discussed.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>On the root cause of the host `mass-step’ in the Hubble residuals of type Ia supernovae</strong>, Chul Chung et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06011v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.06011v1</a></p>

<p>It is well established that the Hubble residuals of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) show the luminosity step with respect to their host galaxy stellar masses. This <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mass-step' is taken as an additional correction factor for the SN Ia luminosity standardization. Here we investigate the root cause of the mass-step and propose that the bimodal nature of the host $age$ distribution is responsible for the step. In particular, by using the empirical $nonlinear$ mass-to-age relation of local galaxies, we convert the mass function of SN Ia hosts to their age distribution. We find that the age distribution shows clear bimodality: a younger ($&lt;$ 6 Gyr) group with lower mass ($\sim 10^{9.5}{\rm M}\_{\rm sun}$) and an older ($&gt;$ 6 Gyr) group with higher mass ($\sim 10^{10.5}{\rm M}\_{\rm sun}$). On the Hubble residual versus host mass plane, the two groups create the mass-step at $\sim 10^{10}{\rm M}\_{\rm sun}$. This leads us to conclude that the host galaxy mass-step can be attributed to the bimodal age distribution in relation to a nonlinear relation between galaxy mass and age. We suggest that the mass-step is another manifestation of the old </code>red sequence’ and the young `blue cloud’ observed in the galactic color–magnitude diagram.</p>

<p>2023-10-09, <strong>Observations of Multiphase, High-Velocity, Shocked Gas in the Vela Supernova Remnant</strong>, Adam M. Ritchey et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05834v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.05834v1</a></p>

<p>We present an analysis of high-resolution far-ultraviolet archival spectra obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope of the star HD 75309, which probes high-velocity shocked gas in the Vela supernova remnant (SNR). We examine high-velocity features from intrinsically strong absorption lines of O I, Si II, Si II<em>, C II, C II</em>, and Si III. We also detect high-velocity components in the N V doublet and compare these features to observations of high-velocity O VI absorption, available from archival Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer data. Kinetic temperatures are derived from the observed fractional abundances of the various ions, while gas densities and thermal pressures are obtained from the relative populations in excited fine-structure levels of C II and Si II. Our results indicate that the highly ionized species at high velocity probe gas in a region immediately behind a shock driven into an interstellar cloud, while the lower ionization species trace material further downstream in the cooling region of the post-shock flow. Low velocity N V and O VI absorption may trace gas in a conductive boundary layer between the unshocked portion of the cloud and the hot X-ray emitting intercloud medium. Temporal variations in high velocity Ca II absorption features observed toward HD 75309 further confirm the highly inhomogeneous nature of the interstellar medium interacting with the Vela SNR.</p>
