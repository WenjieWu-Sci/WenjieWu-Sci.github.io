<p>2023-10-17, <strong>Search for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production in the $2b + 2\ell + E_\mathrm{T}^\mathrm{miss}$ final state in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13\mathrm{TeV}$ with the ATLAS detector</strong>, ATLAS Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11286v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.11286v1</a></p>

<p>A search for non-resonant Higgs boson pair ($HH$) production is presented, in which one of the Higgs bosons decays to a b-quark pair ($b\bar b$) and the other decays to $WW^<em>$, $ZZ^</em>$, or $\tau^+\tau^-$, with in each case a final state with $\ell^+\ell^- +$ neutrinos ($\ell = e, \mu$). The analysis targets separately the gluon-gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production modes. Data recorded by the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $140\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, are used in this analysis. Events are selected to have exactly two $b$-tagged jets and two leptons with opposite electric charge and missing transverse momentum in the final state. These events are classified using multivariate analysis algorithms to separate the $HH$ events from other Standard Model processes. No evidence of the signal is found. The observed (expected) upper limit on the cross-section for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production is determined to be 9.7 (16.2) times the Standard Model prediction at 95% confidence level. The Higgs boson self-interaction coupling parameter $\kappa_\lambda$ and the quadrilinear coupling parameter $\kappa_{2V}$ are each separately constrained by this analysis to be within the ranges ${[-6.2, 13.3]}$ and ${[-0.17, 2.4]}$, respectively, at 95% confidence level, when all other parameters are fixed.</p>

<p>2023-10-17, <strong>Revisiting Renormalization Group Equations of the SMEFT Dimension-Seven Operators</strong>, Di Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11055v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.11055v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we revisit the renormalization group equations (RGEs) of dimension-seven (dim-7) operators in the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) resulting from mixing among dim-7 operators themselves by means of the background field method. Adopting a recently proposed physical basis for dim-7 operators, we achieve the explicit RGEs of all non-redundant dim-7 operators in the SMEFT for the first time. Together with those originating from the dim-5 and dim-6 operators, these results constitute the complete RGEs of dim-7 operators, and hence can be exploited to study full RG-running effects on some lepton- or baryon-number-violating processes involving dim-7 operators in the SMEFT, such as neutrino masses, neutrinoless double beta decay, meson and nucleon decays. We perform an analysis of the structure and perturbative power counting of the obtained one-loop anomalous dimension matrix, which is consistent with a non-renormalization theorem and the naive dimension analysis. Additionally, a partial check on some results is carried out by means of different tools and quantum field gauges.</p>

<p>2023-10-16, <strong>Study of non-standard interaction mediated by a scalar field at ESSnuSB experiment</strong>, ESSnuSB et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10749v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.10749v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper we study non-standard interactions mediated by a scalar field (SNSI) in the context of ESSnuSB experiment. In particular we study the capability of ESSnuSB to put bounds on the SNSI parameters and also study the impact of SNSI in the measurement of the leptonic CP phase $\delta_{\rm CP}$. Existence of SNSI modifies the neutrino mass matrix and this modification can be expressed in terms of three diagonal real parameters ($\eta_{ee}$, $\eta_{\mu\mu}$ and $\eta_{\tau\tau}$) and three off-diagonal complex parameters ($\eta_{e \mu}$, $\eta_{e\tau}$ and $\eta_{\mu\tau}$). Our study shows that the upper bounds on the parameters $\eta_{\mu\mu}$, $\eta_{\tau\tau}$ and $\eta_{\mu\tau}$ depend upon how $\Delta m^2_{31}$ is minimized in the theory. However, this is not the case when one tries to measure the impact of SNSI on $\delta_{\rm CP}$. Further, we show that the CP sensitivity of ESSnuSB can be completely lost for certain values of $\eta_{ee}$ and $\eta_{\mu\tau}$ for which the appearance channel probability becomes independent of $\delta_{\rm CP}$.</p>

<p>2023-10-16, <strong>On Dark Matter Self-interaction via Single Neutrino Exchange Potential</strong>, Yue Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10743v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.10743v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinos â amongst the lightest known particles â can mediate a force driving dark matter self-interaction and the small scale structure of the universe. We explore such a possibility in the simplest neutrino portal dark sector model where neutrino has a Yukawa coupling with a scalar $\phi$ and fermion $\chi$ that are degenerate in mass and together comprise 100\% of dark matter in the universe. We derive the non-relativistic potential generated by single-neutrino exchange which is of the monopole-dipole form and explore $\chi\phi\to\chi\phi$ scattering based on phase shift analysis. Our result shows that Born approximation continues to be valid in the low energy regime and the scattering cross section scales as $1/v^2$ over a wide range of dark matter velocities. Such a velocity-dependent self-interacting cross section can be large enough to explain the shallow density of dwarf galaxy cores and consistent with the upper limit from colliding galaxy clusters. The $1/v^2$ behavior persists down to rather low velocities $v\sim m_\nu/m$ where $m$ is the dark matter mass, leaving the opportunity for further astrophysical probes. Through the neutrino portal, the self-interacting dark matter parameter space can be tested by searches for $Z$-boson and light mesons decaying into the dark sector, as well as low-mass dark matter direct detection experiments.</p>

<p>2023-10-16, <strong>Nuclear deexcitation simulator for neutrino interactions and nucleon decays of $^{12}\text{C}$ and $^{16}\text{O}$ based on TALYS</strong>, Seisho Abe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10394v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.10394v1</a></p>

<p>Nuclear deexcitation associated with neutrino interactions and nucleon decays has a significant impact on a recent key observable for neutrino detectors: neutron multiplicity. However, most existing neutrino Monte Carlo event generators do not consider this process. For a comprehensive prediction of the neutron multiplicity, a nuclear deexcitation simulator based on TALYS named NucDeEx is developed. NucDeEx can be used for neutrino interactions and nucleon decayes for $^{12}\text{C}$ and $^{16}\text{O}$. The author provides the NucDeEx codes and sample codes for applying the NucDeex to widely-used neutrino Monte Carlo event generators, NEUT, NuWro, and GENIE.</p>

<p>2023-10-16, <strong>TANAMI: Tracking Active Galactic Nuclei with Austral Milliarcsecond Interferometry. III. First-epoch S band images</strong>, Petra Benke et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10206v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.10206v1</a></p>

<p>With the emergence of very high energy astronomy (VHE; E&gt;100 GeV), new open questions were presented to astronomers studying the multi-wavelength emission from blazars. Answers to these open questions, such as the Doppler crisis, and finding the location of the high-energy activity have eluded us thus far. Recently, quasi-simultaneous multi-wavelength monitoring programs have shown considerable success in investigating blazar activity. After the launch of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in 2008, such quasi-simultaneous observations across the electromagnetic spectrum became possible. In addition, with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations we can resolve the central parsec region of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and compare morphological changes to the gamma-ray activity to study high-energy emitting blazars. To achieve our goals, we need sensitive, long-term VLBI monitoring of a complete sample of VHE detected AGN. We performed VLBI observations of TeV-detected AGN and high likelihood neutrino associations as of December of 2021 with the Long Baseline Array (LBA) and other southern hemisphere radio telescopes at 2.3 GHz. In this paper we present first light TANAMI S-band images, focusing on the TeV-detected sub-sample of the full TANAMI sample. Apart from these very high energy-detected sources, we also show images of the two flux density calibrators and two additional sources included in the observations. We study the redshift, 0.1-100 GeV photon flux and S-band core brightness temperature distributions of the TeV-detected objects, and find that flat spectrum radio quasars and low synchrotron peaked sources on average show higher brightness temperatures than high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs. Sources with bright GeV gamma-ray emission also show higher brightness temperature values than gamma-low sources.</p>

<p>2023-10-16, <strong>Constraining Ultralight Axions with CSST Weak Gravitational Lensing and Galaxy Clustering Photometric Surveys</strong>, Hengjie Lin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10140v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.10140v2</a></p>

<p>Ultralight axion (ULA) can be one of the potential candidates for dark matter. The extremely low mass of the ULA can lead to a de Broglie wavelength around galaxy-size, and result in a suppression of the structure growth at small scales. This allows us to study its properties via galaxy surveys for probing cosmic structure formation. In this work, we forecast the constraint on the ULA particle mass $m_{\text{a}}$ and relative fraction to dark matter $f_{\text{a}} = \Omega_{\text{a}}/\Omega_{\text{d}}$ for the forthcoming Stage IV space-based optical survey equipment $\it{CSST}$ (China Space Station Telescope). We focus on the $\it{CSST}$ cosmic shear and galaxy clustering photometric surveys, and forecast the measurements of shear, galaxy, and galaxy-galaxy lensing power spectra (i.e. 3$\times$2pt). The effects of neutrino, baryonic feedback, and uncertainties of intrinsic alignment, shear calibration, galaxy bias, and photometric redshift are also included in the analysis. After performing a joint constraint on all the cosmological and systematical parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, we obtain a lower limit of the ULA particle mass $\text{log}_{10}(m_{\text{a}}/\text{eV}) \geqslant -22.5$ and an upper limit of the ULA fraction $f_{\text{a}} \leqslant 0.83$ at 95\% confidence level, and $\text{log}_{10}(m_{\text{a}}/\text{eV}) \geqslant -21.9$ with $f_{\text{a}} \leqslant 0.77$ when ignoring the baryonic feedback. We find that the CSST photometric surveys can improve the constraint on the ULA mass by about one order of magnitude, compared to the current constraints using the same kind of observational data.</p>

<p>2023-10-16, <strong>$N_{\rm eff}$ as a new physics probe in the precision era of cosmology</strong>, Yong Du et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10034v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.10034v1</a></p>

<p>We perform a global fit to the electroweak vertices and 4-fermion operators of the standard model effective field theory in this work using $N_{\rm eff}$ from cosmological probes, as well as data sets from colliders and low-energy experiments. Assuming flavor universality for both leptons and quarks, we find $N_{\rm eff}$ from CMB-S4/HD can improve the fit for several operators by a factor of a few. Without making any flavor assumption instead, $N_{\rm eff}$ can probe a different direction compared with the well-known flat one presented in the neutrino trident process in the $4\mu$ sector. Fresh sensitivity to two extra operators in the $\tau$ sector is also identified at the 10% level. In addition, we find reducing the uncertainty in primordial helium abundance from metal-poor galaxies down below 0.2% could play an important role in deepening our understanding on the free neutron lifetime anomaly.</p>

<p>2023-10-17, <strong>A Full Accounting of the Visible Mass in SDSS MaNGA Disk Galaxies</strong>, Nitya Ravi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11422v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.11422v1</a></p>

<p>We present a study of the ratio of visible mass to total mass in spiral galaxies to better understand the relative amount of dark matter present in galaxies of different masses and evolutionary stages. Using the velocities of the H-alpha emission line measured in spectroscopic observations from the SDSS MaNGA DR17, we evaluate the rotational velocity of 5522 disk galaxies at their 90% elliptical Petrosian radii, R90. We compare this to the velocity expected from the total visible mass, which we compute from the stellar, HI, molecular hydrogen, heavy metal, and dust masses. Molecular hydrogen mass measurements are available for only a small subset of galaxies observed in SDSS MaNGA DR17, so we derive a parameterization of the molecular hydrogen mass as a function of absolute magnitude in the r-band using galaxies observed as part of SDSS DR7. With these parameterizations, we calculate the fraction of visible mass within R90 that corresponds to the observed velocity. Based on statistically analyzing the likelihood of this fraction, we conclude that the null hypothesis (no dark matter) cannot be excluded at a confidence level better than 95% within the visible extent of the disk galaxies. We also find that, by including all of these mass components, star-forming disk galaxies contain statistically the same ratio of visible-to-total mass, independent of magnitude.</p>

<p>2023-10-17, <strong>Exploring Late-Time Cosmic Acceleration with EoS Parameterizations in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity via Baryon Acoustic Oscillations</strong>, Madhur Khurana et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11413v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.11413v1</a></p>

<p>In our study, we have adopted the framework of Horava-Lifshitz gravity to model the Universeâs dark matter and dark energy components. Specifically, we have considered two recent parametrizations for dark energy models: the CBDRM-type and CADMM-type parameterizations. In our analysis, we have explicitly expressed the Hubble parameter, denoted as $H(z)$, for these two distinct dark energy models. By doing so, we have aimed to investigate and quantify the accelerated cosmic expansion rate characterizing the late-time Universe. Our study uses a wide range of datasets. This dataset consists of recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) collected over a period of twenty years with the Cosmic Chronometers (CC) dataset, Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) dataset, the Hubble diagram of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), quasars (Q), and the latest measurement of the Hubble constant (R22). Consequently, we present a crucial aspect of our study by plotting the $r_{d}$ vs. $H_{0}$ plane. In the context of the $\Lambda$CDM model, after incorporating all the datasets, including the R22 prior, we obtain the following results: $H_{0}$ = $71.674089 \pm 0.734089$ $km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$ and $r_d = 143.050380 Mpc \pm 3.702038$. For the CBDRM model, we find $H_{0}$ = $72.355058 \pm 1.004604$ $km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$ and $r_d = 144.835069 Mpc \pm 2.378848$. In the case of the CADMM model, our analysis yields $H_{0}$ = $72.347804 \pm 0.923328$ $km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$ and $r_d = 144.466836 Mpc \pm 4.288758$. We have conducted cosmographic analyses for both of the proposed parameterizations in comparison to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Additionally, we have applied Diagnostic tests to investigate the evolution of both models. Finally, the Information Criteria test demonstrates that the $\Lambda$CDM model emerges as the preferred choice among the models we have considered.</p>

<p>2023-10-17, <strong>Dark matter scattering off ${}^4$He in chiral effective field theory</strong>, J. de Vries et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11343v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.11343v1</a></p>

<p>We study dark matter scattering off ${}^4$He and other light nuclei using chiral effective field theory. We consider scalar DM interactions and include both one- and two-nucleon scattering processes. The DM interactions and nuclear wave functions are obtained from chiral effective field theory and we work up to fourth order in the chiral expansion for the latter to investigate the chiral convergence. The results for the scattering rates can be used to determine the sensitivity of planned experiments to detect relatively light dark matter particles using ${}^4$He. We find that next-to-leading-order scalar currents are smaller than expected from power counting for scattering off ${}^4$He confirming earlier work. However, the results for two-nucleon corrections exhibit a linear regulator dependence indicating potential problems in the applied power counting. We observe a linear correlation between the, in principle not observable, D-wave probability of various light nuclei and the scalar two-nucleon matrix elements, again pointing towards potentially missing contributions.</p>

<p>2023-10-17, <strong>Status and first results from XENONnT</strong>, S. E. M. Ahmed Maouloud et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11322v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.11322v1</a></p>

<p>XENON is a project for direct dark matter search located in the INFN underground laboratory LNGS. The previous generation of XENON detector, XENON1T, achieved an exposure of 1 ton$\times$year, setting the most stringent limits on the spin-independent scattering cross section of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) on nucleons for nearly the complete range of WIMP masses above $120$ MeV. The multi-tonne XENONnT detector is the next step in the evolution of the XENON project. The experiment, aimed at directly detecting WIMPs, utilizes $5.9~t$ of instrumented liquid Xenon (LXe). The expected overall background in the detector is based on dedicated screening results of all detector materials. In contrast, improvements in mitigating intrinsic backgrounds from electronic recoil sources allow XENONnT to reduce this background compared to its predecessor. Adding a neutron veto around the XENONnT cryostat also allows for a significant rejection of the neutron background. XENONnT aims at achieving a 20 ton$\times$year exposure over its lifetime. The talk summarised the main results of XENON1T and the status of XENONnT.</p>

<p>2023-10-17, <strong>QUEST-DMC superfluid $^3$He detector for sub-GeV dark matter</strong>, S. Autti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11304v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.11304v1</a></p>

<p>The focus of dark matter searches to date has been on Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) in the GeV/$c^2$-TeV/$c^2$ mass range. The direct, indirect and collider searches in this mass range have been extensive but ultimately unsuccessful, providing a strong motivation for widening the search outside this range. Here we describe a new concept for a dark matter experiment, employing superfluid $^3$He as a detector for dark matter that is close to the mass of the proton, of order 1 GeV/$c^2$. The QUEST-DMC detector concept is based on quasiparticle detection in a bolometer cell by a nanomechanical resonator. In this paper we develop the energy measurement methodology and detector response model, simulate candidate dark matter signals and expected background interactions, and calculate the sensitivity of such a detector. We project that such a detector can reach sub-eV nuclear recoil energy threshold, opening up new windows on the parameter space of both spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions of light dark matter candidates.</p>

<p>We present a calculation of the continuum part of the gamma-ray spectra resulting from Dark Matter annihilation in the framework of the MSSM taking into account Sommerfeld effects. Concentrating on pure wino and pure higgsino scenarios we compare our calculation to existing work and explore the numerical impact of the features not captured by previous approximative descriptions. We find that, in particular for large neutralino masses, when the Sommerfeld enhancement is very large, chargino-antichargino annihilation processes, which have not been considered before, lead to sizable differences with respect to existing calculations. In scenarios with neutralinos in the intermediate-mass range, we find that the role of the charginos is crucial in the endpoint regime. Our calculation provides the currently most accurate prediction for the continuum gamma-ray spectra.</p>

<p>Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) could be promising candidate for not only the Dark Matter (DM) content of the universe but also the source of Gravitational Waves (GWs) observed by Ligo-Virgo. In the present work, generation of PBHs and secondary GWs from non-canonical Higgs inflation have been probed. It is elucidated that, Higgs potential in non-canonical setup with a generalized power-law Lagrangian density can source a consistent inflationary era with the latest observational data. Besides, we show that our model satisfies the swampland criteria. At the same time, defining a peaked function of inflaton field as non-canonical mass scale parameter $M(\phi)$ of the Lagrangian, gives rise to slow down the inflaton in a while. In this interim, namely Ultra-Slow-Roll (USR) stage, the amplitude of the curvature perturbations on small scales enlarges versus CMB scales. It has been illustrated that, further to the peaked aspect of the chosen non-canonical mass scale parameter, the amount of $\alpha$ parameter of the Lagrangian has enlarging impact on the amplitude of the scalar perturbations. As a consequence of adjusting three parameter Cases of this model, three Cases of PBHs in proper mass scopes to explain LIGO-VIRGO events, microlensing events in OGLE data and DM content in its totality, could be produced. It is indicated that, current density parameter spectra $(\Omega_{\rm GW_0})$ of the coeval GWs with these PBHs can be traced by various GWs observatories. In the end, power-law behavior of the spectra of $\Omega_{\rm GW_0}$ in terms of frequency has been examined. The logarithmic power index as $n=3-2/\ln(f_c/f)$ in the infrared regime is obtained for each Case of the model.</p>

The Connections Between Stellar Mass Growth History, Quenching History and Halo Assembly History for Central Galaxies</strong>, Cheqiu Lyu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10733v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.10733v1</a></p>

<p>The assembly of galaxies over cosmic time is tightly connected to the assembly of their host dark matter halos. We investigate the stellar mass growth history and the chemical enrichment history of central galaxies in SDSS-MaNGA. We find that the derived stellar metallicity of passive central galaxies is always higher than that of the star-forming ones. This stellar metallicity enhancement becomes progressively larger towards low-mass galaxies (at a given epoch) and earlier epochs (at a given stellar mass), which suggests strangulation as the primary mechanism for star formation quenching in central galaxies not only in the local universe, but also very likely at higher redshifts up to $z\sim3$. We show that at the same present-day stellar mass, passive central galaxies assembled half of their final stellar mass $\sim 2$ Gyr earlier than star-forming central galaxies, which agrees well with semi-analytic model. Exploring semi-analytic model, we find that this is because passive central galaxies reside in, on average, more massive halos with a higher halo mass increase rate across cosmic time. As a consequence, passive central galaxies are assembled faster and also quenched earlier than their star-forming counterparts. While at the same present-day halo mass, different halo assembly history also produces very different final stellar mass of the central galaxy within, and halos assembled earlier host more massive centrals with a higher quenched fraction, in particular around the âgolden halo massâ at $10^{12}\mathrm{M_\odot}$. Our results call attention back to the dark matter halo as a key driver of galaxy evolution.</p>

<p>2023-10-16, <strong>Population III star formation: multiple gas phases prevent the use of an equation of state at high densities</strong>, Lewis R. Prole et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10730v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.10730v1</a></p>

<p>Advanced primordial chemistry networks have been developed to model the collapse of metal-free baryonic gas within the gravitational well of dark matter (DM) halos and its subsequent collapse into Population III stars. At the low densities of 10^-26-10^-21 g cm-3 (10-3-10^2 cm-3) the collapse is dependent on H2 production, which is a function of the compressional heating provided by the DM potential. Once the gas decouples from the DM, the temperature-density relationship follows a well established path dictated by various chemical reactions until the formation of the protostar at 10^-4 g cm-3 (10^19 cm-3). Here we explore the feasibility of replacing the chemical network (CN) with a barotropic equation of state (EoS) just before the formation of the first protostar, to reduce the computational load of simulating the further fragmentation, evolution and characteristics of the very high density gas. We find a significant reduction in fragmentation when using the EoS. The EoS method produces a protostellar mass distribution that peaks at higher masses when compared to CN runs. The change in fragmentation behaviour is due to a lack of cold gas falling in through the disc around the first protostar when using an EoS. Despite this, the total mass accreted across all sinks was invariant to the switch to an EoS, hence the star formation rate (Msun yr^-1) is accurately predicted using an EoS. The EoS routine is approximately 4000 times faster than the CN, however this numerical gain is offset by the lack of accuracy in modelling secondary protostar formation and hence its use must be considered carefully.</p>

<p>We present DE-VAE, a variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture to search for a compressed representation of dynamical dark energy (DE) models in observational studies of the cosmic large-scale structure. DE-VAE is trained on matter power spectra boosts generated at wavenumbers $k\in(0.01-2.5) \ h/\rm{Mpc}$ and at four redshift values $z\in(0.1,0.48,0.78,1.5)$ for the most typical dynamical DE parametrization with two extra parameters describing an evolving DE equation of state. The boosts are compressed to a lower-dimensional representation, which is concatenated with standard cold dark matter (CDM) parameters and then mapped back to reconstructed boosts; both the compression and the reconstruction components are parametrized as neural networks. Remarkably, we find that a single latent parameter is sufficient to predict 95% (99%) of DE power spectra generated over a broad range of cosmological parameters within $1\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) of a Gaussian error which includes cosmic variance, shot noise and systematic effects for a Stage IV-like survey. This single parameter shows a high mutual information with the two DE parameters, and these three variables can be linked together with an explicit equation through symbolic regression. Considering a model with two latent variables only marginally improves the accuracy of the predictions, and adding a third latent variable has no significant impact on the modelâs performance. We discuss how the DE-VAE architecture can be extended from a proof of concept to a general framework to be employed in the search for a common lower-dimensional parametrization of a wide range of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models and for different cosmological datasets. Such a framework could then both inform the development of cosmological surveys by targeting optimal probes, and provide theoretical insight into the common phenomenological aspects of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models.</p>

<p>Strong gravitational lensing can be used to find otherwise invisible dark matter subhaloes. In such an analysis, the lens galaxy mass model is a significant source of systematic uncertainty. In this paper we analyse the effect of angular complexity in the lens model. We use multipole perturbations which introduce low-order deviations from pure ellipticity in the isodensity contours, keeping the radial density profile fixed. We find that, in HST-like data, multipole perturbations consistent with those seen in galaxy isophotes are very effective at causing false positive substructure detections. We show that the effectiveness of this degeneracy depends on the deviation from a pure ellipse and the lensing configuration. We find that, when multipoles of one per cent are allowed in the lens model, the area in the observation where a subhalo could be detected drops by a factor of three. Sensitivity away from the lensed images is mostly lost. However, the mass limit of detectable objects on or close to the lensed images does not change. We do not expect the addition of multipole perturbations to lens models to have a significant effect on the ability of strong lensing to constrain the underlying dark matter model. However, given the high rate of false positive detections, angular complexity beyond the elliptical power-law should be included for such studies to be reliable. We discuss implications for previous detections and future work.</p>

<p>2023-10-16, <strong>Exploring spin of ultralight dark matter with gravitational wave detectors</strong>, Yusuke Manita et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10646v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.10646v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a novel method for distinguishing the spin of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) using interferometric gravitational wave detectors. ULDM can be a bosonic field of spin-0, 1, or 2, and each induces distinctive signatures in signals. We find that the finite-time traveling effect causes a dominant signal for spin-0 and spin-1 ULDM, while not for spin-2. By using overlap reduction functions (ORF) of multiple detectors, we can differentiate between the spins of ULDM. Furthermore, we point out that the current constraint on the coupling constant of spin-1 ULDM to baryons becomes 30 times weaker when the finite-time light-travel effect on the ORF is taken into account.</p>

<p>The indirect search for dark matter is typically restricted to individual photon bands and instruments. In the context of multiwavelength observations, finding a weak signal in large fore- and backgrounds at only one wavelength band is hampered by systematic uncertainties dominating the signal strength. Dark matter particle annihilation is producing Standard Model particles of which the prompt photon emission is searched for in many studies. However, also the secondary emission of charged particles from dark matter annihilation in the TeV range results in comparable or even stronger fluxes in the GHz-GeV range. In this study, we calculate the prompt and secondary emission of a scotogenic WIMP with a mass of $1\,\mathrm{TeV}$ in 27 dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way. For the secondary emission, we include Inverse Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung, and synchrotron radiation, which results in a âtriple humpâ structure characteristic for only dark matter and no other astrophysical source. In order to determine the best candidates for multi-instrument analyses, we estimate the diffuse emission component of the Milky Way itself, including its own dark matter halo from the same scotogenic WIMP model. We find signal-to-background ratios of individual sources on the order of $10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}$ across X- to $\gamma$-rays assuming $J$-factors for the cold dark matter distribution inferred from observations and no additional boosting due to small-scale clumping. We argue that a joint multi-wavelength analysis of all nearby galaxies as well as the extension towards the Cosmic Gamma-ray Background is required to disentangle possible dark matter signals from astrophysical back- and foregrounds.</p>

<p>2023-10-16, <strong>Measuring the Milky Way Vertical Potential with the Phase Snail in a Model Independent Way</strong>, Rui Guo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10225v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.10225v1</a></p>

<p>The vertical phase-space spiral (snail) is a direct sign of dis-equilibrium of Milky Wayâs disc. Nevertheless, the wrapping of the phase snail contains information of the vertical potential. We propose a novel method to measure the vertical potential utilizing the intersections between the snail and $z$/$V_{z}$ axes, for which we know the maximum vertical heights ($Z_{max}$) or the maximum vertical velocities ($V_{z,max}$). Using a refined linear interpolation method, we directly obtain $(Z_{max},\ \frac{1}{2}V_{z,max}^{2})$ for these snail intersections to constrain the vertical potential profile empirically. Our method is model independent since no assumptions about the snail shape or the vertical potential have been made. Although the snail binned by the guiding center radius ($R_{g}$) is more prominent, it traces a vertical potential shallower than that of the snail binned by the same Galactocentric radius ($R$). We apply an empirical method to correct this difference. We measure the snail intersections in several $R_{g}$ bins within $7.5&lt; R_{g} &lt; 11.0$ kpc for Gaia DR3, and apply the interpolation method to deduce the potential values at several vertical heights. The potential at the snail intersections, as well as the following mass modeling are consistent with the popular Milky Way potentials in the literature. For the $R_{g}$-binned phase snail in the Solar neighborhood, the mass modeling indicates a local dark matter density of $\rho_{\rm dm}= 0.0150\pm0.0031$ $\rm M_{\odot}\,pc^{-3}$, consistent with previous works. Our method could be applied to larger radial ranges in future works, to provide independent and stronger constraints on the Milky Wayâs potential.</p>

<p>At present, there is practically no doubt that general relativity is closely related to gravity. Moreover, after the work of Jacobson, Padmanabhan and others, it became clear that a thermodynamic interpretation of Einsteinâs relativistic equations is possible. On the other hand, we are witnessing the conceptual problems of the SCM (the problem of the cosmological constant, the problem of coincidences) and many years of futile attempts to directly fix the main components of the model (dark energy and dark matter). The combination of these two factors gave rise to a natural desire, at least at the phenomenological level, to build a cosmological model that represents the synthesis of gravity and thermodynamics and does not include components of an unknown nature. It is this model`uentropic cosmology`uthat is considered in this review. We have set as our goal, omitting the details that can be found in the references given, to present the conceptual foundations of the model.</p>

<p>2023-10-17, <strong>Exploring Late-Time Cosmic Acceleration with EoS Parameterizations in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity via Baryon Acoustic Oscillations</strong>, Madhur Khurana et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11413v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.11413v1</a></p>

<p>In our study, we have adopted the framework of Horava-Lifshitz gravity to model the Universeâs dark matter and dark energy components. Specifically, we have considered two recent parametrizations for dark energy models: the CBDRM-type and CADMM-type parameterizations. In our analysis, we have explicitly expressed the Hubble parameter, denoted as $H(z)$, for these two distinct dark energy models. By doing so, we have aimed to investigate and quantify the accelerated cosmic expansion rate characterizing the late-time Universe. Our study uses a wide range of datasets. This dataset consists of recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) collected over a period of twenty years with the Cosmic Chronometers (CC) dataset, Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) dataset, the Hubble diagram of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), quasars (Q), and the latest measurement of the Hubble constant (R22). Consequently, we present a crucial aspect of our study by plotting the $r_{d}$ vs. $H_{0}$ plane. In the context of the $\Lambda$CDM model, after incorporating all the datasets, including the R22 prior, we obtain the following results: $H_{0}$ = $71.674089 \pm 0.734089$ $km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$ and $r_d = 143.050380 Mpc \pm 3.702038$. For the CBDRM model, we find $H_{0}$ = $72.355058 \pm 1.004604$ $km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$ and $r_d = 144.835069 Mpc \pm 2.378848$. In the case of the CADMM model, our analysis yields $H_{0}$ = $72.347804 \pm 0.923328$ $km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$ and $r_d = 144.466836 Mpc \pm 4.288758$. We have conducted cosmographic analyses for both of the proposed parameterizations in comparison to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Additionally, we have applied Diagnostic tests to investigate the evolution of both models. Finally, the Information Criteria test demonstrates that the $\Lambda$CDM model emerges as the preferred choice among the models we have considered.</p>

<p>Observing a supernova explosion shortly after it occurs can reveal important information about the physics of stellar explosions and the nature of the progenitor stars of supernovae (SNe). When a star with a well-defined edge explodes in vacuum, the first photons to escape from its surface appear as a brief shock-breakout flare. The duration of this flare can extend to at most a few hours even for nonspherical breakouts from supergiant stars, after which the explosion ejecta should expand and cool. Alternatively, for stars exploding within a distribution of sufficiently dense optically thick circumstellar material, the first photons escape from the material beyond the stellar edge, and the duration of the initial flare can extend to several days, during which the escaping emission indicates photospheric heating. The difficulty in detecting SN explosions promptly after the event has so far limited data regarding supergiant stellar explosions mostly to serendipitous observations that, owing to the lack of ultraviolet (UV) data, were unable to determine whether the early emission is heating or cooling, and hence the nature of the early explosion event. Here, we report observations of SN 2023ixf in the nearby galaxy M101, covering the early days of the event. Using UV spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as well as a comprehensive set of additional multiwavelength observations, we trace the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of the event and are able to temporally resolve the emergence and evolution of the SN emission.</p>

<p>2023-10-16, <strong>Low-energy Explosions in a Gravitational Field: Implications for Sub-energetic Supernovae and Fast X-ray Transients</strong>, Daniel A. Paradiso et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10713v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.10713v1</a></p>

<p>Observations and theory suggest that core-collapse supernovae can span a range of explosion energies, and when sub-energetic, the shockwave initiating the explosion can decelerate to speeds comparable to the escape speed of the progenitor. In these cases, gravity will complicate the explosion hydrodynamics and conceivably cause the shock to stall at large radii within the progenitor star. To understand these unique properties of weak explosions, we develop a perturbative approach for modeling the propagation of an initially strong shock into a time-steady, infalling medium in the gravitational field of a compact object. This method writes the shock position and the post-shock velocity, density, and pressure as series solutions in the (time-dependent) ratio of the freefall speed to the shock speed, and predicts that the shock stalls within the progenitor if the explosion energy is below a critical value. We show that our model agrees very well with hydrodynamic simulations, and accurately predicts (e.g.) the time-dependent shock position and velocity and the radius at which the shock stalls. Our results have implications for black hole formation and the newly detected class of fast X-ray transients (FXTs). In particular, we propose that a ``phantom shock breakoutââ â where the outer edge of the star falls through a stalled shock â can yield a burst of X-rays without a subsequent optical/UV signature, similar to FXTs. This model predicts the rise time of the X-ray burst, $t_{\rm d}$, and the mean photon energy, $kT$, are anti-correlated, approximately as $T \propto t_{\rm d}^{-5/8}$.</p>

<p>2023-10-16, <strong>Delayed Massive-Star Mechanical Feedback at Low Metallicity</strong>, Michelle C. Jecmen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10589v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.10589v1</a></p>

<p>The classical model of massive-star mechanical feedback is based on effects at solar metallicity (Zsun), yet feedback parameters are very different at low metallicity. Metal-poor stellar winds are much weaker, and more massive supernova progenitors likely collapse directly to black holes without exploding. Thus, for ~0.4 Zsun we find reductions in the total integrated mechanical energy and momentum of ~40% and 75%, respectively, compared to values classically expected at solar metallicity. But in particular, these changes effectively delay the onset of mechanical feedback until ages of ~10 Myr. Feedback from high-mass X-ray binaries could slightly increase mechanical luminosity between ages 5-10 Myr, but it is stochastic and unlikely to be significant on this timescale. Stellar dynamical mechanisms remove most massive stars from clusters well before 10 Myr, which would further promote this effect; this process is exacerbated by gas retention implied by weak feedback. Delayed mechanical feedback implies that radiation feedback therefore dominates at early ages, which is consistent with the observed absence of superwinds in some extreme starbursts. This scenario may lead to higher star-formation efficiencies, multiple stellar populations in clusters, and higher Lyman continuum escape. This could explain the giant star-forming complexes in metal-poor galaxies and the small sizes of OB superbubble shells relative to their inferred ages. It could also drive modest effects on galactic chemical evolution, including on oxygen abundances. Thus, delayed low-metallicity mechanical feedback may have broad implications, including for early cosmic epochs.</p>

<p>2023-10-16, <strong>Searching for X-Ray Counterparts of Degree Wide TeV Halos Around Middle-Aged Pulsars with SRG/eROSITA</strong>, A. Khokhriakova et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10454v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.10454v1</a></p>

<p>Context. Extended gamma-ray TeV emission (TeV halos) around middle-aged pulsars has been detected. A proposed model to explain these TeV halos is that electrons from a degree-wide Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) get up-scattered by cosmic microwave background photons through inverse Compton processes. However, no X-ray degree-wide faint diffuse PWNe have been found around these middle-aged pulsars in previous X-ray observations.   Aims. We have performed a search for degree wide PWNe around Geminga, PSR B0656+14, B0540+23, J0633+0632, and J0631+1036, using data from the first four consecutive Spectrum Roentgen Gamma/eROSITA all-sky surveys. In order to better understand the mechanisms underlying the formation of TeV halos, we investigated the magnetic field strength in the degree wide neighbourhood of those pulsars.   Results. We did not detect degree-wide diffuse emission around Geminga, PSR B0656+14, B0540+23, J0633+0632, and J0631+1036, which can be attributed to being powered by the rotation-powered pulsars. Indeed, a close inspection of the data shows that the pulsars of interest are all embedded in diffuse emission from supernova remnants like the Monogem Ring or the Rosetta Nebula, while PSR B0540+23 is located ~2.5 degrees away from the bright Crab pulsar, which shines out the eROSITA point-spread function up to the position of PSR B0540+23 and thus reduced the sensitivity to search for degree wide bright diffuse X-ray emission strongly.   Conclusions. Despite the non-detection of any degree-wide PWN surrounding the analysed pulsars, we set flux upper limits to provide useful information on magnetic field strength and its spatial distribution around those pulsars, providing additional constraints to the proposed theory for the formation of TeV halos around pulsars.</p>

<p>The X-ray source CXOU J163802.6-471358is thought to be a pulsar wind nebula (PWN), as it shows an extended, $\approx 40$ arcsec trail from a compact source. Here we present GMRT observations of this source at 330 and 1390 MHz, which reveal a remarkable linear radio trail $\approx 90$ arcsec in extent. Although the radio trail points back to the supernova remnant (SNR) G338.1+0.4, $\approx 50$ arcmin from ,CXOU J163802.6-471358 associating it with this remnant would require a very large velocity for the pulsar. There are no known galactic SNRs close to the PWN and radio trail. No pulsar has yet been identified in CXOU J163802.6-471358, but if one could be found, this would allow more quantitative studies of the PWN and radio trail to be made.</p>

<p>The population of optical transients evolving within a time-scale of a few hours or a day (so-called Fast Optical Transients, FOTs) has recently been debated extensively. In particular, our understanding of extragalactic FOTs and their rates is limited. We present a search for extragalactic FOTs with the Tomo-e Gozen high-cadence survey. Using the data taken from 2019 August to 2022 June, we obtain 113 FOT candidates. Through light curve analysis and cross-matching with other survey data, we find that most of these candidates are in fact supernovae, variable quasars, and Galactic dwarf novae, that were partially observed around their peak brightness. We find no promising candidate of extragalactic FOTs. From this non-detection, we obtain upper limits on the event rate of extragalactic FOTs as a function of their time-scale. For a very luminous event (absolute magnitude M&lt;-26 mag), we obtain the upper limits of 4.4 x 10^{-9} Mpc^{-3} yr^{-1} for a time-scale of 4 h, and 7.4 x 10^{-10} Mpc^{-3} yr^{-1} for a time-scale of 1 d. Thanks to our wide (although shallow) surveying strategy, our data are less affected by the cosmological effects, and thus, give one of the more stringent limits to the event rate of intrinsically luminous transients with a time-scale of &lt; 1 d.</p>

<p>We present the host galaxies of four apparently non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs), FRBs 20181223C, 20190418A, 20191220A, and 20190425A, reported in the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME/FRB) catalog. Our selection of these FRBs is based on a planned hypothesis testing framework where we search all CHIME/FRB Catalog-1 events that have low extragalactic dispersion measure (&lt; 100 pc cm$^{-3}$), with high Galactic latitude (|b| &gt; 10$\deg$) and saved baseband data. We associate the selected FRBs to galaxies with moderate to high star-formation rates located at redshifts between 0.027 and 0.071. We also search for possible multi-messenger counterparts, including persistent compact radio and gravitational wave (GW) sources, and find none. Utilizing the four FRB hosts from this study along with the hosts of 14 published local Universe FRBs (z &lt; 0.1) with robust host association, we conduct an FRB host demographics analysis. We find all 18 local Universe FRB hosts in our sample to be spirals (or late-type galaxies), including the host of FRB 20220509G, which was previously reported to be elliptical. Using this observation, we scrutinize proposed FRB source formation channels and argue that core-collapse supernovae are likely the dominant channel to form FRB progenitors. Moreover, we infer no significant difference in the host properties of repeating and apparently non-repeating FRBs in our local Universe FRB host sample. Finally, we find the burst rates of these four apparently non-repeating FRBs to be consistent with those of the sample of localized repeating FRBs observed by CHIME/FRB. Therefore, we encourage further monitoring of these FRBs with more sensitive radio telescopes.</p>

<p>The Hubble constant problem is that the values of Hubble constant from the observation of cosmic microwave background assuming the LambdaCDM model disagrees with the values from direct measurements. This problem suggests some new physics beyond the LambdaCDM model. Typically there are two ways of reconciliation: one is the realization of smaller value of sound horizon at recombination, and the other is the modification of the way of expansion of the universe after recombination. In this letter we examine the latter possibility by comparing two typical phenomenological dark energy models with the distance-redshift relation provided by Pantheon catalogue of supernova observations and galaxy surveys by BOSS and eBOSS collaborations. Though these phenomenological dark energy models globally fit observations better than the LambdaCDM model, they are strongly disfavored by the distance-redshift relation as almost the same level as the LambdaCDM model defined by cosmic microwave background observations. The distance-redshift relation strongly suggests some new physics which realize smaller value of sound horizon at recombination.</p>

<p>2023-10-16, <strong>Broadband radio study of the North Polar Spur: Origin of the spectral turnover with insights into the X-ray and Gamma-ray spectra</strong>, Iwashita Ryoji et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10007v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.10007v1</a></p>

<p>The North Polar Spur (NPS) is a giant structure that is clearly visible in both radio and X-ray all-sky maps. We analyzed broadband radio observations covering a range between 22 MHz and 70 GHz to systematically analyze the thermal/non-thermal emissions associated with the NPS. We demonstrate that the radio emission of the NPS comprises synchrotron, free-free, and dust emission; however, synchrotron emissions dominate over other emissions, especially at high galactic-latitudes. Moreover, the synchrotron spectra exhibit a power-law behavior with $N(\gamma)\propto\gamma^{-s}$ ($s\simeq1.8-2.4$) up to a few GHz moderated by a turnover at $\nu_{\rm brk} \simeq 1$ GHz, above which the spectral index $s$ decrease by one. Assuming that the turnover is due to the electrons cooled by synchrotron radiation before escaping (or advecting) from the emission region, the magnetic field strength can be estimated to be $B\sim 8 \rm\mu G$ if the NPS is a distant structure that is near the Galactic Center (GC). However, an unreasonably strong $B\sim 114\rm\mu G$ is required if the NPS is near the local supernova remnant (SNR). The corresponding non-thermal energy stored in the NPS is $E_{\rm n/th}\simeq 4.4\times 10^{55}$ erg in the GC scenario, whereas $E_{\rm n/th}\simeq 4.1\times 10^{52}$ erg is difficult to explain with a single local SNR. We also estimated the gamma-ray emission associated with the NPS through inverse Comptonization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which peaks at 100 - 1000 keV with a flux of $\nu F_{\nu}\sim 10^{-9}$ $\rm erg\,cm^{-2}s^{-1}sr^{-1}$ in the GC model, and may be a good candidate for detection by future X-ray/gamma-ray observatories.</p>
