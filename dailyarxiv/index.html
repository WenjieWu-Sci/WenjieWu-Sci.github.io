<p>2023-06-07, <strong>$β^-$ decay $Q$-value measurement of $^{136}$Cs and its implications to neutrino studies</strong>, Z. Ge et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04604v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.04604v1</a></p>

<p>The $\beta^-$ decay $Q$-value of $^{136}$Cs ($J^\pi = 5^+$, $t_{1/2} \approx 13$~days) was measured with the JYFLTRAP Penning trap setup at the Ion Guide Isotope Separator On-Line (IGISOL) facility of the University of Jyv"askyl"a, Finland. The mono-isotopic samples required in the measurements were prepared with a new scheme utilised for the cleaning, based on the coupling of dipolar excitation with Ramsey’s method of time-separated oscillatory fields and the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance (PI-ICR) technique. The $Q$ value is determined to be 2536.83(45) keV, which is $\sim$4 times more precise and 11.4(20) keV ($\sim$ 6$\sigma$) smaller than the adopted value in the most recent Atomic Mass Evaluation AME2020. The daughter, $^{136}$Ba, has a 4$^+$ state at 2544.481(24) keV and a $3^-$ state at 2532.653(23) keV, both of which can potentially be ultralow $Q$-value end-states for the $^{136}$Cs decay. With our new ground-to-ground state $Q$ value, the decay energies to these two states become -7.65(45) keV and 4.18(45) keV, respectively. The former is confirmed to be negative at the level of $\sim$ 17$\sigma$, which verifies that this transition is not a suitable candidate for neutrino mass determination. On the other hand, the slightly negative $Q$ value makes this transition an interesting candidate for the study of virtual $\beta$-$\gamma$ transitions. The decay to the 3$^{-}$ state is validated to have a positive low $Q$ value which makes it a viable candidate for neutrino mass determination. For this transition, we obtained a shell-model-based half-life estimate of $2.1_{-0.8}^{+1.6}\times10^{12}$ yr.</p>

<p>2023-06-07, <strong>Structure Factors for Hot Neutron Matter from Ab Initio Lattice Simulations with High-Fidelity Chiral Interactions</strong>, Yuan-Zhuo Ma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04500v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.04500v1</a></p>

<p>We present the first ab initio lattice calculations of spin and density correlations in hot neutron matter using high-fidelity interactions at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) in chiral effective field theory. These correlations have a large impact on neutrino heating and shock revival in core-collapse supernovae and are encapsulated in functions called structure factors. Unfortunately, calculations of structure factors using high-fidelity chiral interactions were well out of reach using existing computational methods. In this work, we solve the problem using a computational approach called the rank-one operator (RO) method. The RO method is a general technique with broad applications to simulations of fermionic many-body systems. It uses the fact that the determinant of a matrix composed of rank-one operators is at most linear in each operator coefficient. Using the RO method, we compute the vector and axial static structure factors for hot neutron matter as a function of temperature and density. The ab initio lattice results are in good agreement with virial expansion calculations at low densities and can be used to calibrate random phase approximation codes commonly used to estimate many-body effects on the neutrino opacity in core-collapse supernovae.</p>

<p>2023-06-06, <strong>Measurement of $ν_μ$ Charged-Current Inclusive $π^0$ Production in the NOvA Near Detector</strong>, NOvA Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04028v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.04028v1</a></p>

<p>Cross sections for the interaction $\nu_\mu A\rightarrow\mu^-\pi^0 X$ with neutrino energies between 1 and 5~GeV are measured using a sample of 165k selected events collected in the NOvA experiment’s Near Detector, a hydrocarbon-based detector exposed to the NuMI neutrino beam at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. Results are presented as a flux-averaged total cross section and as differential cross sections in the momenta and angles of the outgoing muon and $\pi^0$, the total four-momentum transfer, and the invariant mass of the hadronic system. Comparisons are made with predictions from a reference version of the GENIE neutrino interaction generator. The measured total cross section of ($3.57\pm0.44)\times10^{-39}\ \mathrm{cm}^2$ is $7.5\%$ higher than the GENIE prediction but is consistent within experimental errors.</p>

<p>2023-06-06, <strong>The FLAMINGO project: cosmological hydrodynamical simulations for large-scale structure and galaxy cluster surveys</strong>, Joop Schaye et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04024v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.04024v1</a></p>

<p>We introduce the Virgo Consortium’s FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations for cosmology and galaxy cluster physics. To ensure the simulations are sufficiently realistic for studies of large-scale structure, the subgrid prescriptions for stellar and AGN feedback are calibrated to the observed low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function and cluster gas fractions. The calibration is performed using machine learning, separately for three resolutions. This approach enables specification of the model by the observables to which they are calibrated. The calibration accounts for a number of potential observational biases and for random errors in the observed stellar masses. The two most demanding simulations have box sizes of 1.0 and 2.8 Gpc and baryonic particle masses of $1\times10^8$ and $1\times10^9 \text{M}_\odot$, respectively. For the latter resolution the suite includes 12 model variations in a 1 Gpc box. There are 8 variations at fixed cosmology, including shifts in the stellar mass function and/or the cluster gas fractions to which we calibrate, and two alternative implementations of AGN feedback (thermal or jets). The remaining 4 variations use the unmodified calibration data but different cosmologies, including different neutrino masses. The 2.8 Gpc simulation follows $3\times10^{11}$ particles, making it the largest ever hydrodynamical simulation run to $z=0$. Lightcone output is produced on-the-fly for up to 8 different observers. We investigate numerical convergence, show that the simulations reproduce the calibration data, and compare with a number of galaxy, cluster, and large-scale structure observations, finding very good agreement with the data for converged predictions. Finally, by comparing hydrodynamical and `dark-matter-only’ simulations, we confirm that baryonic effects can suppress the halo mass function and the matter power spectrum by up to $\approx20$ per cent.</p>

<p>2023-06-06, <strong>Three-Dimensional General-Relativistic Simulations of Neutrino-Driven Winds from Magnetized Proto-Neutron Stars</strong>, Dhruv K. Desai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03973v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.03973v1</a></p>

<p>Formed in the aftermath of a core-collapse supernova or neutron star merger, a hot proto-neutron star (PNS) launches an outflow driven by neutrino heating lasting for up to tens of seconds. Though such winds are considered potential sites for the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements via the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process), previous work has shown that unmagnetized PNS winds fail to achieve the necessary combination of high entropy and/or short dynamical timescale in the seed nucleus formation region. We present three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations of PNS winds which include the effects of a dynamically strong ($B \gtrsim 10^{15}$ G) dipole magnetic field. After initializing the magnetic field, the wind quickly develops a helmet-streamer configuration, characterized by outflows along open polar magnetic field lines and a ``closed’’ zone of trapped plasma at lower latitudes. Neutrino heating within the closed zone causes the thermal pressure of the trapped material to rise in time compared to the polar outflow regions, ultimately leading to the expulsion of this matter from the closed zone on a timescale of $\sim$60 ms, consistent with the predictions of \citet{Thompson03}. The high entropies of these transient ejecta are still growing at the end of our simulations and are sufficient to enable a successful 2nd-peak $r$-process in at least a modest $\gtrsim 1\%$ of the equatorial wind ejecta.</p>

<p>2023-06-06, <strong>Potential Constraints to Neutrino-Nucleus Interactions Based on Electron Scattering Data</strong>, V. Pandey et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03896v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.03896v1</a></p>

<p>A thorough understanding of neutrino-nucleus interactions physics is crucial to achieving precision goals in broader neutrino physics programs. The complexity of nuclei comprising the detectors and limited understanding of their weak response constitutes one of the biggest systematic uncertainties in neutrino experiments - both at intermediate energies affecting the short- and long-baseline neutrino programs as well as at lower energies affecting coherent scattering neutrino programs. While electron and neutrino interactions are different at the primary vertex, many underlying relevant physical processes in the nucleus are the same in both cases, and electron scattering data collected with precisely controlled kinematics, large statistics and high precision allows one to constrain nuclear properties and specific interaction processes. To this end, electron-nucleus scattering experiments provide vital complementary information to test, assess and validate different nuclear models and event generators intended to be used in neutrino experiments. In fact, for many decades, the study of electron scattering off a nucleus has been used as a tool to probe the properties of that nucleus and its electromagnetic response. While previously existing electron scattering data provide important information, new and proposed measurements are tied closely to what is required for the neutrino program in terms of expanding kinematic reach, the addition of relevant nuclei and information on the final states hadronic system.</p>

<p>2023-06-06, <strong>Conformal anomaly and gravitational pair production</strong>, M. N. Chernodub et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03892v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.03892v1</a></p>

<p>We argue that the rate density of particle pair production $\Gamma$ in background fields in conformal field theories is determined by the conformal anomaly and related to anomalous trace of the energy-momentum tensor as $\Gamma = (\pi/2) \langle T^\mu_{\ \mu}\rangle$ if the trace is positive (and $\Gamma = 0$ otherwise). This formula perfectly reproduces (presumably, non-Hawking) radiation generated by static gravitational fields in the absence of an event horizon via a new evaporation mechanism suggested recently. Our relation also correctly describes the one-loop Schwinger pair creation in massless (scalar and spinor) quantum electrodynamics. It also accurately points to the Savvidi instability of the gluonic vacuum towards the formation of the chromomagnetic condensate. Photon and neutrino pair production are also discussed.</p>

<p>2023-06-06, <strong>A Scotogenic explanation for the 95 GeV excesses</strong>, Pablo Escribano et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03735v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.03735v1</a></p>

<p>Several hints of the presence of a new state at about $95$ GeV have been observed recently. The CMS and ATLAS collaborations have reported excesses in the diphoton channel at about this diphoton invariant mass with local statistical significances of $2.9 \, \sigma$ and $1.7 \,\sigma$, respectively. Furthermore, a $2 \, \sigma$ excess in the $b\bar{b}$ final state was also observed at LEP, again pointing at a similar mass value. We interpret these intriguing hints of new physics in a variant of the Scotogenic model, an economical scenario that induces Majorana neutrino masses at the loop level and includes a viable dark matter candidate. We show that our model can naturally explain the 95 GeV excesses while respecting all experimental constraints and discuss other phenomenological predictions of our scenario.</p>

<p>2023-06-06, <strong>Dispersive determination of neutrino mass orderings</strong>, Hsiang-nan Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03463v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.03463v1</a></p>

<p>We argue that the mixing phenomenon of a neutral meson formed by a fictitious massive quark will disappear, if the electroweak symmetry of the Standard Model (SM) is restored at a high energy scale. This disappearance is taken as the high-energy input for the dispersion relation, which must be obeyed by the width difference between two meson mass eigenstates. The solution to the dispersion relation at low energy, i.e., in the symmetry broken phase, then connects the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements to the quark masses involved in the box diagrams responsible for meson mixing. It is demonstrated via the analysis of the $D$ meson mixing that the typical $d$, $s$ and $b$ quark masses demand the CKM matrix elements in agreement with measured values. In particular, the known numerical relation $V_{us}\approx \sqrt{m_s/m_b}$ with the $s$ ($b$) quark mass $m_s$ ($m_b$) can be derived analytically from our solution. Next we apply the same formalism to the mixing of the $\mu^- e^+$ and $\mu^+ e^-$ states through similar box diagrams with intermediate neutrino channels. It is shown that the neutrino masses in the normal hierarchy (NH), instead of in the inverted hierarchy or quasi-degenerate spectrum, match the observed Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix elements. The lepton mixing angles larger than the quark ones are explained by means of the inequality $m_2^2/m_3^2\gg m_s^2/m_b^2$, $m_{2,3}$ being the neutrino masses in the NH. At last, the solution for the $\tau^-e^+$-$\tau^+e^-$ mixing specifies the mixing angle $\theta_{23}\approx 45^\circ$ with slight preference for the first octant. Our work suggests that the fermion masses and mixing parameters are constrained dynamically, and the neutrino mass orderings can be discriminated by the internal consistency of the SM.</p>

<p>2023-06-06, <strong>A stacked search for spatial coincidences between IceCube neutrinos and radio pulsars</strong>, Vibhavasu Pasumarti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03427v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.03427v1</a></p>

<p>We carry out a stacked search for spatial coincidences between all known radio pulsars and TeV neutrinos from the IceCube 10 year (2008-2018) point source catalog as a followup to our previous work on looking for coincidences with individual pulsars. We consider three different weighting schemes to stack the contribution from individual pulsars. We do not find a statistically significant excess using this method. We report the 95% c.l. differential neutrino flux limit as a function of neutrino energy. We have also made our analysis codes publicly available.</p>

<p>2023-06-07, <strong>The CYGNO experiment, a directional detector for direct Dark Matter searches</strong>, F. D. Amaro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04568v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.04568v1</a></p>

<p>The CYGNO project aims at the development of a high precision optical readout gaseous Tima Projection Chamber (TPC) for directional dark matter (DM) searches, to be hosted at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS). CYGNO employs a He:CF$_4$ gas mixture at atmospheric pressure with a Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) based amplification structure coupled to an optical readout comprised of sCMOS cameras and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). This experimental setup allows to achieve 3D tracking and background rejection down to O(1) keV energy, to boost sensitivity to low WIMP masses. The characteristics of the optical readout approach in terms of the light yield will be illustrated along with the particle identification properties. The project timeline foresees, in the next 2-3 years, the realisation and installation of a 0.4 m$^3$ TPC in the underground laboratories at LNGS to act as a demonstrator. Finally, the studies of the expected DM sensitivities of the CYGNO demonstrator will be presented.</p>

<p>2023-06-07, <strong>Palatini $f(R)$ gravity tests in the weak field limit: Solar System, seismology and galaxies</strong>, Alejandro Hernandez-Arboleda et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04475v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.04475v1</a></p>

<p>Palatini $f(R)$ gravity is probably the simplest extension of general relativity (GR) and the simplest realization of a metric-affine theory. It has the same number of degrees of freedom as GR and, in vacuum, it is straightforwardly mapped into GR with a cosmological constant. The mapping between GR and Palatini $f(R)$ inside matter is possible but at the expense of reinterpreting the meaning of the matter fields. The physical meaning and consequences of such mapping will depend on the physical context. Here we consider three such cases within the weak field limit: Solar System dynamics, planetary internal dynamics (seismology), and galaxies. After revising our previous results on the Solar System and Earth’s seismology, we consider here the possibility of $f(R)$ Palatini as a dark matter candidate. For any $f(R)$ that admits a polynomial approximation in the weak field limit, we show here, using SPARC data and a recent method that we proposed, that the theory cannot be used to replace dark matter in galaxies. We also show that the same result applies to the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity. Differently from the metric $f(R)$ case, the rotation curve data are sufficient for this conclusion. This result does not exclude a combination of modified gravity and dark matter.</p>

<p>2023-06-07, <strong>Dark Matter Constraints from Isomeric $^{\bf 178m}$Hf</strong>, D. S. M. Alves et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04442v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.04442v1</a></p>

<p>We describe a first measurement of the radiation from a $^{\bf 178m}$Hf sample to search for dark matter. The $\gamma$ flux from this sample, possessed by Los Alamos National Laboratory nuclear chemistry, was measured with a Ge detector at a distance of 4 ft due to its high activity. We search for $\gamma$s that cannot arise from the radioactive decay of $^{\bf 178m}$Hf, but might arise from the production of a nuclear state due to the inelastic scattering with dark matter. The limits obtained on this $\gamma$ flux are then translated into constraints on the parameter space of inelastic dark matter. Finally, we describe the potential reach of future studies with $^{\bf 178m}$Hf.</p>

<p>2023-06-07, <strong>Electroweak Corrections to Higgs Boson Decays in a Complex Singlet Extension of the SM and their Phenomenological Impact</strong>, Felix Egle et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04127v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.04127v1</a></p>

<p>The complex singlet extension CxSM of the Standard Model (SM) is a simple extension of the SM with two visible Higgs bosons in the spectrum and a Dark Matter (DM) candidate. In this paper we complete the computation of the next-to-leading (NLO) electroweak (EW) corrections to on-shell and non-loop-induced Higgs decays. Our calculations are implemented in the code EWsHDECAY which also includes the relevant QCD corrections. Performing an extensive parameter scan in the model and including all relevant theoretical and experimental single- and di-Higgs as well as DM constraints, we obtain a viable parameter sample. We find that current DM constraints are able to test the model in DM mass regions where collider searches are not sensitive. The relative EW corrections turn out to be large for scenarios with relatively large couplings, threshold effects or small leading-order (LO) widths. Otherwise, they are of typical EW size and can amount up to about 20-25%. The theory uncertainty derived from the change of the renormalization scheme dependence then is of a few per cent. While the NLO corrections applied in the constraints due to single- and di-Higgs searches impact the validity of specific parameter points, the overall shape of the allowed parameter region is not yet sensitive to the EW corrections. This picture will change with further increased experimental precision in the future and necessitates precise predictions on the theory side as presented in this paper.</p>

<p>We show that the present-day dark matter abundance can be produced through a novel mechanism that involves a very rapid thermal freeze-out caused by inhomogeneous heating and successive fast cooling of small fireballs in the early Universe. The fireballs can be produced from energy deposited in small scale structure growth induced by Yukawa interactions in certain particle species. Yukawa interactions are known to cause growth of halos even during a radiation dominated era, and the same interactions facilitate cooling and collapse of the halos by the emission of scalars. Energy deposited in the Standard Model plasma at the locations of the halo collapse can heat the plasma, re-establishing thermal equilibrium. The subsequent expansion and cooling of plasma fireballs leads to freeze-out of dark matter on time scales much shorter than the Hubble time. This mechanism can produce the right abundance of dark matter for masses and annihilation cross sections previously thought to be ruled out.</p>

<p>2023-06-06, <strong>The Structure and Dynamics of Massive High-$z$ Cosmic-Web Filaments: Three Radial Zones in Filament Cross-Sections</strong>, Yue Samuel Lu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03966v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.03966v1</a></p>

<p>We analyze the internal cross-section structure and dynamics of inter-halo cosmic-web filaments that connect to massive high-$z$ galaxies. Our analysis is based on a high-resolution \texttt{AREPO} cosmological simulation zooming in on a volume encompassing three filaments of $\sim 1 \, \Mpc$ length feeding three massive haloes of $\sim 10^{12}\,\msun$ at $z \sim 4$, embedded in a large-scale sheet. Each filament is surrounded by a strong cylindrical accretion shock of radius $r_{\rm shock} \sim 50 \kpc$, within which the gas is in virial equilibrium in the potential well set by an isothermal dark-matter filament. The cross-section of the filament can be divided into three radial zones. In the outer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thermal'' (\textbf{T}) zone, $r \geq 0.65 \, r\_{\rm shock}$, the inward gravity and ram-pressure forces from the inflowing gas are over-balanced by outward thermal pressure forces, causing the inflowing gas to decelerate and the shock to expand outwards. In the intermediate</code>vortex’’ (\textbf{V}) zone, $0.25 \leq r/ r_{\rm shock} \leq 0.65$, the velocity field is dominated by a quadrupolar vortex structure due to offset inflow along the sheet through the post-shock gas. The outward force is provided mainly by centrifugal forces associated with these vortices and, to a lesser extent, by global rotation and thermal pressure, while shear and turbulent forces that are also associated with the vortex structure add to the force inward. The inner ``stream’’ (\textbf{S}) zone, $r &lt; 0.25 \, r_{\rm shock}$, is a dense isothermal core defining the cold streams that feed the galaxies, with $T\sim 3 \times 10^4 \, \Kdegree$ and $n_{\rm H}\sim 0.01 \cmc$. The core is formed by an isobaric cooling flow that results from post-shock cooling on a free-fall time, and is associated with a decrease in the outward forces, though the gas within the core exhibits both inflows and outflows.

<p>With 60M articles in more than 300 language versions, Wikipedia is the largest platform for open and freely accessible knowledge. While the available content has been growing continuously at a rate of around 200K new articles each month, very little attention has been paid to the accessibility of the content. One crucial aspect of accessibility is the integration of hyperlinks into the network so the articles are visible to readers navigating Wikipedia. In order to understand this phenomenon, we conduct the first systematic study of orphan articles, which are articles without any incoming links from other Wikipedia articles, across 319 different language versions of Wikipedia. We find that a surprisingly large extent of content, roughly 15\% (8.8M) of all articles, is de facto invisible to readers navigating Wikipedia, and thus, rightfully term orphan articles as the dark matter of Wikipedia. We also provide causal evidence through a quasi-experiment that adding new incoming links to orphans (de-orphanization) leads to a statistically significant increase of their visibility in terms of the number of pageviews. We further highlight the challenges faced by editors for de-orphanizing articles, demonstrate the need to support them in addressing this issue, and provide potential solutions for developing automated tools based on cross-lingual approaches. Overall, our work not only unravels a key limitation in the link structure of Wikipedia and quantitatively assesses its impact, but also provides a new perspective on the challenges of maintenance associated with content creation at scale in Wikipedia.</p>

<p>2023-06-06, <strong>Observational Evidence for Primordial Black Holes: A Positivist Perspective</strong>, Bernard Carr et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03903v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.03903v1</a></p>

<p>We review numerous arguments for primordial black holes (PBHs) based on observational evidence from a variety of lensing, dynamical, accretion and gravitational-wave effects. This represents a shift from the usual emphasis on PBH constraints and provides what we term a positivist perspective. Microlensing observations of stars and quasars suggest that PBHs of around $1\,M_{\odot}$ could provide much of the dark matter in galactic halos, this being allowed by the Large Magellanic Cloud observations if the PBHs have an extended mass function. More generally, providing the mass and dark matter fraction of the PBHs is large enough, the associated Poisson fluctuations could generate the first bound objects at a much earlier epoch than in the standard cosmological scenario. This simultaneously explains the recent detection of high-redshift dwarf galaxies, puzzling correlations of the source-subtracted infrared and X-ray cosmic backgrounds, the size and the mass-to-light ratios of ultra-faint-dwarf galaxies, the dynamical heating of the Galactic disk, and the binary coalescences observed by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA in a mass range not usually associated with stellar remnants. Even if PBHs provide only a small fraction of the dark matter, they could explain various other observational conundra, and sufficiently large ones could seed the supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei or even early galaxies themselves. We argue that PBHs would naturally have formed around the electroweak, quantum chromodynamics and electron-positron annihilation epochs, when the sound-speed inevitably dips. This leads to an extended PBH mass function with a number of distinct bumps, the most prominent one being at around $1\,M_{\odot}$, and this would allow PBHs to explain much of the evidence in a unified way.</p>

<p>We studied the cosmological dynamics of a dilatonic ghost condensate field as a source of dark energy, which is non-minimally coupled to gravity through torsion. We performed a detailed phase-space analysis by finding all the critical points and their stability conditions. Also, we compared our results with the latest $H(z)$ and Supernovae Ia observational data. In particular, we found the conditions for the existence of scaling regimes during the dark matter era. Furthermore, we obtained the conditions for a successful exit from the scaling regime, such that, at late times, the universe tends towards an attractor point describing the dark energy-dominated era. These intriguing features can allow us to alleviate the energy scale problem of dark energy since, during a scaling regime, the field energy density is not necessarily negligible at early times.</p>

<p>2023-06-07, <strong>Implications of a Possible Spectral Structure of Cosmic-ray Protons Unveiled by the DAMPE</strong>, Lin Nie et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04558v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.04558v1</a></p>

<p>The recent observations revealed that the cosmic-ray (CR) proton spectrum showed a complex structure: the hardening at $\rm \sim 200\,GeV$ and softening at $\rm \sim 10\,TeV$. However, so far the physical origins of this spectral feature remain strongly debated. In this work, we simulate the acceleration of cosmic-ray protons in a nearby Supernova remnant (SNR) by solving numerically the hydrodynamic equations and the equation for the quasi-isotropic CR momentum distribution in the spherically symmetrical case to derive the spectrum of protons injected into the interstellar medium (ISM), and then simulate the propagation process of those accelerated CR particles to calculate the proton fluxes reaching the Earth. Besides, we use the DRAGON numerical code to calculate the large-scale cosmic-ray proton spectrum. Our simulated results are in good agreement with the observed data (including the observed data of proton fluxes and dipole anisotropy). We conclude that the spectral feature of cosmic-ray protons in this energy band may originate from the superposition of the distribution from the nearby SNR and background diffusive cosmic-ray component. We find that the release of particles from this nearby SNR has a time delay. Besides, it can be found that the nonlinear response of energetic particles, release time of CR protons, and age of the local SNR can leave strong signatures in the spectrum of the resulting CR proton fluxes.</p>

<p>2023-06-06, <strong>Detection of the Cosmological Time Dilation of High Redshift Quasars</strong>, Geraint F. Lewis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04053v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.04053v1</a></p>

<p>A fundamental prediction of relativistic cosmologies is that, due to the expansion of space, observations of the distant cosmos should be time dilated and appear to run slower than events in the local universe. Whilst observations of cosmological supernovae unambiguously display the expected redshift-dependent time dilation, this has not been the case for other distant sources. Here we present the identification of cosmic time dilation in a sample of 190 quasars monitored for over two decades in multiple wavebands by assessing various hypotheses through Bayesian analysis. This detection counters previous claims that observed quasar variability lacked the expected redshift-dependent time dilation. Hence, as well as demonstrating the claim that the lack of the redshift dependence of quasar variability represents a significant challenge to the standard cosmological model, this analysis further indicates that the properties of quasars are consistent with them being truly cosmologically distant sources.</p>

<p>2023-06-06, <strong>Corrected SFD: A More Accurate Galactic Dust Map with Minimal Extragalactic Contamination</strong>, Yi-Kuan Chiang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03926v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.03926v1</a></p>

<p>The widely used Milky Way dust reddening map, the Schlegel, Finkbeiner, &amp; Davis (1998, SFD) map, was found to contain extragalactic large-scale structure (LSS) imprints (Chiang &amp; M'enard 2019). Such contamination is inherent in maps based on infrared emission, which pick up not only Galactic dust but also the cosmic infrared background (CIB). When SFD is used for extinction correction, over-correction occurs in a spatially correlated and redshift-dependent manner, which could impact precision cosmology using galaxy clustering, lensing, and supernova Ia distances. Similarly, LSS imprints in other Galactic templates can affect intensity mapping and cosmic microwave background experiments. This paper presents a generic way to remove LSS traces in Galactic maps and applies it to SFD. First, we measure descriptive summary statistics of the CIB in SFD by cross-correlating the map with spectroscopic galaxies and quasars in SDSS tomographically as functions of redshift and angular scale. To reconstruct the LSS on the map level, however, additional information on the phases is needed. We build a large set of 180 overcomplete, full-sky basis template maps from the density fields of over 450 million galaxies in WISE and find a linear combination that reproduces all the high-dimensional tomographic two-point statistics of the CIB in SFD. After subtracting this reconstructed LSS/CIB field, the end product is a full-sky Galactic dust reddening map that supersedes SFD, carrying all Galactic features therein, with maximally suppressed CIB. We release this new dust map dubbed CSFD, the Corrected SFD, to the community at https://idv.sinica.edu.tw/ykchiang/CSFD.html.</p>

<p>A future Galactic Supernova (SN) explosion can lead to a gamma-ray signal induced by ultralight Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) thermally produced in the SN core and converted into high-energy photons in the Galactic magnetic field. The detection of such a signal is in the reach of the Large Area Telescope aboard the \emph{Fermi} Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. The observation of gamma-ray emission from a future SN has a sensitivity to $g_{a\gamma}\gtrsim 4\times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for a SN at fiducial distance of $10$ kpc and would allow us to reconstruct the ALP-photon coupling within a factor of $\sim2$, mainly due to the uncertainties on the modeling of the Galactic magnetic field.</p>

<p>2023-06-06, <strong>The fastest stars in the Galaxy</strong>, Kareem El-Badry et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03914v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.03914v1</a></p>

<p>We report a spectroscopic search for hypervelocity white dwarfs (WDs) that are runaways from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and related thermonuclear explosions. Candidates are selected from Gaia data with high tangential velocities and blue colors. We find six new runaways, including four stars with radial velocities (RVs) $&gt;1000\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ and total space velocities $\gtrsim 1300\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$. These are most likely the surviving donors from double-degenerate binaries in which the other WD exploded. The other two objects have lower minimum velocities, $\gtrsim 600\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$, and may have formed through a different mechanism, such as pure deflagration of a WD in a Type Iax supernova. The four fastest stars are hotter and smaller than the previously known “D$^6$ stars,” with effective temperatures ranging from $\sim$20,000 to $\sim$130,000 K and radii of $\sim 0.02-0.10\,R_{\odot}$. Three of these have carbon-dominated atmospheres, and one has a helium-dominated atmosphere. Two stars have RVs of $-1694$ and $-2285\rm \,km\,s^{-1}$ – the fastest systemic stellar RVs ever measured. Their inferred birth velocities, $\sim 2200-2500\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$, imply that both WDs in the progenitor binary had masses $&gt;1.0\,M_{\odot}$. The high observed velocities suggest that a dominant fraction of the observed hypervelocity WD population comes from double-degenerate binaries whose total mass significantly exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit. However, the two nearest and faintest D$^6$ stars have the lowest velocities and masses, suggesting that observational selection effects favor rarer, higher-mass stars. A significant population of fainter low-mass runaways may still await discovery. We infer a birth rate of D$^6$ stars that is consistent with the SN Ia rate. The birth rate is poorly constrained, however, because the luminosities and lifetimes of $\rm D^6$ stars are uncertain.</p>

<p>We systematically compare the temporal and spectral properties of 53 Supernova (SN)-associated and 15 Kilonova (KN)-associated Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). We find that the spectral parameters of both types GRBs are identically and lognormally distributed, consistent with those normal GRBs. The bolometric luminosities of SN/GRBs and KN/GRBs have a triple form with the corresponding break luminosities of SN/GRBs are roughly two orders of magnitude larger than those of KN/GRBs. We build the power-law relations between the spectral lag and the luminosity of prompt $\gamma$-rays with indices of $-1.43\pm0.33$ for SN/GRBs and $-2.17\pm0.57$ for KN/GRBs in the laboratory frame, which are respectively coincident with the rest-frame values. We verify that both SN/GRBs and KN/GRBs comply with their own Amati relations that match those of long and short GRBs, respectively. Analyzing X-ray afterglows with good plateau segments, we build the power-law relations between the X-ray luminosity and the plateau time with an index of $-1.12\pm0.17$ for KN/GRBs and $-1.08\pm0.22$ for SN/GRBs, which can be well explained by the relativistic shock driven by an energy injection. The plots of luminosity-lag, Amati relation and luminosity-time show heavy overlap between the two types of GRBs, implying that they might share the same radiation mechanism despite originating from different progenitors or central engines.</p>

<p>2023-06-06, <strong>Many Roads Lead to Lithium: Formation Pathways For Lithium-Rich Red Giants</strong>, Maryum Sayeed et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03323v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.03323v1</a></p>

<p>Stellar models predict that lithium (Li) inside a star is destroyed during the first dredge-up phase, yet 1.2% of red giant stars are Li-rich. We aim to uncover possible origins of this population, by analysing 1155 Li-rich giants (A(Li) $\geq$ 1.5) in GALAH DR3. To expose peculiar traits of Li-rich stars, we construct a reference sample of Li-normal (doppelg"anger) stars with matched evolutionary state and fiducial supernova abundances. Comparing Li-rich and doppelg"anger spectra reveals systematic differences in the H-$\alpha$ and Ca-triplet line profiles associated with the velocity broadening measurement. We also find twice as many Li-rich stars appear to be fast rotators (2% with $v_\textrm{broad} \gtrsim 20$ km s$^{-1}$) compared to doppelg"angers. On average, Li-rich stars have higher abundances than their doppelg"angers, for a subset of elements, and Li-rich stars at the base of RGB have higher mean $s-$process abundances ($\geq 0.05$ dex for Ba, Y, Zr), relative to their doppelg"angers. External mass-transfer from intermediate-mass AGB companions could explain this signature. Additional companion analysis excludes binaries with mass ratios $\gtrsim$ 0.5 at $\gtrsim$ 7 AU. We also discover that highly Ba-enriched stars are missing from the Li-rich population, possibly due to low-mass AGB companions which preclude Li-enrichment. Finally, we confirm a prevalence of Li-rich stars on the red clump that increases with lithium, which supports an evolutionary state mechanism for Li-enhancement. Multiple culprits, including binary spin-up and mass-transfer, are therefore likely mechanisms of Li-enrichment.</p>
