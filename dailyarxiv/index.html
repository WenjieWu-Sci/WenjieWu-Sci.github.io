<p>2024-04-17, <strong>Explaining Fermions Mass and Mixing Hierarchies through $U(1)_X$ and $Z_2$ Symmetries</strong>, Abdul Rahaman Shaikh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11570v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.11570v1</a></p>

<p>For understanding the hierarchies of fermion masses and mixing, we extend the standard model gauge group with $U(1)_X$ and $Z_2$ symmetry. The field content of the Standard model is augmented by three heavy right-handed neutrinos and two new scalar singlets. $U(1)_X$ charges of different fields are considered after satisfying anomaly cancellation conditions. In this scenario, the fermion masses are generated through higher dimensional effective operators. The small neutrino masses are obtained through type-1 seesaw mechanism using the heavy right handed neutrino fields. We discuss the flavor-changing neutral current processes which is originated due to the sequential nature of $U(1)_X$ symmetry. We have written effective higher dimensional operators in terms of renormalizable dimension four operators by introducing vector like fermions.</p>

<p>2024-04-17, <strong>Stage-IV Cosmic Shear with Modified Gravity and Model-independent Screening</strong>, Maria Tsedrik et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11508v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.11508v1</a></p>

<p>We forecast constraints on minimal model-independent parametrisations of several Modified Gravity theories using mock Stage-IV cosmic shear data. We include nonlinear effects and screening, which ensures recovery of General Relativity on small scales. We introduce a power spectrum emulator to accelerate our analysis and evaluate the robustness of the growth index parametrisation with respect to two cosmologies: $\Lambda$CDM and the normal branch of the DGP model. We forecast the uncertainties on the growth index $\gamma$ to be of the order $\sim 10\%$. We find that our halo-model based screening approach demonstrates excellent performance, meeting the precision requirements of Stage-IV surveys. However, neglecting the screening transition results in biased predictions for cosmological parameters. We find that the screening transition shows significant degeneracy with baryonic feedback, requiring a much better understanding of baryonic physics for its detection. Massive neutrinos effects are less prominent and challenging to detect solely with cosmic shear data.</p>

<p>2024-04-17, <strong>Local clustering of relic neutrinos: Comparison of kinetic field theory and the Vlasov equation</strong>, Emil Brinch Holm et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11295v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.11295v1</a></p>

<p>Gravitational clustering in our cosmic vicinity is expected to lead to an enhancement of the local density of relic neutrinos. We derive expressions for the neutrino density, using a perturbative approach to kinetic field theory and perturbative solutions of the Vlasov equation up to second order. Our work reveals that both formalisms give exactly the same results and can thus be considered equivalent. Numerical evaluation of the local relic neutrino density at first and second order provides some fundamental insights into the frequently applied approach of linear response to neutrino clustering (also known as the Gilbert equation). Against the naive expectation, including the second-order contribution does not lead to an improvement of the prediction for the local relic neutrino density but to a dramatic overestimation. This is because perturbation theory breaks down in a momentum-dependent fashion and in particular for densities well below unity.</p>

<p>2024-04-16, <strong>First double-differential cross section measurement of neutral-current $π^0$ production in neutrino-argon scattering in the MicroBooNE detector</strong>, MicroBooNE collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10948v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.10948v1</a></p>

<p>We report the first double-differential cross section measurement of neutral-current neutral pion (NC$\pi^0$) production in neutrino-argon scattering, as well as single-differential measurements of the same channel in terms of final states with and without protons. The kinematic variables of interest for these measurements are the $\pi^0$ momentum and the $\pi^0$ scattering angle with respect to the neutrino beam. A total of 4971 candidate NC$\pi^0$ events fully-contained within the MicroBooNE detector are selected using data collected at a mean neutrino energy of $\sim 0.8$ GeV from $6.4\times10^{20}$ protons on target from the Booster Neutrino Beam at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. After extensive data-driven model validation to ensure unbiased unfolding, the Wiener-SVD method is used to extract nominal flux-averaged cross sections. The results are compared to predictions from commonly used neutrino event generators, which tend to overpredict the measured NC$\pi^0$ cross section, especially in the 0.2-0.5 GeV/c $\pi^0$ momentum range, at forward scattering angles, and when at least one proton is present in the final state. These measurements show sensitivity to a variety of features that complicate the description of NC$\pi^0$ production including the form factors describing the elementary neutrino interaction and the final state interactions of the outgoing particles in the residual argon nucleus. This data will help improve the modeling of NC$\pi^0$ production, which represents a major background in measurements of charge-parity violation in the neutrino sector and in searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model.</p>

<p>2024-04-16, <strong>Ultra-light Dark Matter Limits from Astrophysical Neutrino Flavor</strong>, Carlos A. Argüelles et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10926v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.10926v1</a></p>

<p>Ultra-light dark matter is a class of dark matter models where the mass of the dark matter particle is very small and the dark matter behaves as a classical field pervading our galaxy. If astrophysical neutrinos interact with ultra-light dark matter, these interactions would produce a matter potential in our galaxy which may cause anomalous flavor conversions. Recently, IceCube high-energy starting event flavor measurements are used to set stringent limits on isotropic Lorentz violating fields under the Standard-Model Extension framework. We apply the IceCube Lorentz violation limits to set limits on neutrino - ultra-light dark matter couplings. We assume the dark matter field undergoes fast oscillations in our galaxy, yielding neutrino interactions with dark matter that broaden and smear the observed flavor structure of astrophysical neutrinos at IceCube. The constraints we obtain are an order of magnitude tighter than current and future terrestrial neutrino experimental limits. The sensitivity of ultra-light dark matter can be further improved in the near future by new particle identification algorithms in IceCube and the emergence of next-generation neutrino telescopes.</p>

<p>2024-04-16, <strong>In-depth analysis of solar models with high-metallicity abundances and updated opacity tables</strong>, G. Buldgen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10478v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.10478v1</a></p>

<p>Due to the high quality constraints available for the Sun, we can carry out combined analyses using neutrino, spectroscopic and helioseismic observations. Such studies lay the ground for future improvements of key physical components of solar and stellar models, such as the equation of state, radiative opacities or prescriptions for macroscopic transport processes of chemicals which are then used to study other stars in the Universe. We study the existing degeneracies in solar models using the recent high-metallicity spectroscopic abundances by comparing them to helioseismic and neutrino data and discuss how their properties are impacted by changes in various physical ingredients. We carry out a detailed study of solar models computed with a high-metallicity composition from the literature based on averaged-3D models that was claimed to solve the solar problem. The properties of the solar models are significantly affected by using the recent OPLIB opacities and the inclusion of macroscopic transport. The properties of the standard solar models computed using the OPAL opacities are similar to those using the OP opacities. We show that a modifying the temperature gradient just below the base of the convective zone is required to erase the discrepancies in solar models, particularly in the presence of macroscopic mixing. This can be simulated by a local increase of opacity of a few percent. We conclude that the existing degeneracies and issues in solar modelling are not erased by an increase in the solar metallicity in contradiction to was suggested in recent papers. Therefore, standard solar models cannot be used as an argument for a high metallicity composition. While further work is required to improve solar models, we note that direct helioseismic inversions indicate a low metallicity in the convective envelope, in agreement with spectroscopic analyses based on full 3D models.</p>

<p>2024-04-16, <strong>A newly developed multi-kilo-channel high-speed and precision waveform digitization system for neutrino experiments</strong>, H. Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10373v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.10373v1</a></p>

<p>The Jinping Neutrino Experiment(JNE), conducted within the China Jinping Underground Laboratory, aims to detect and analyze of solar neutrinos, geo-neutrinos, and supernova neutrinos. A one-ton prototype will soon be in commision with an upgrade from 30 channels to 60 channels, which will increase the data bandwidth by one to two orders of magnitude and exceed the capacity of the current CAEN DAQ system. Additionally, enhancing the performance and flexibility of JNE DAQ system is crucial. This paper presents the design of a new Tsinghua DAQ system for the JNE and its performance and stability. The new Tsinghua DAQ(THDAQ) system for JNE is based on the cPCI protocol and demonstrates powerful performance improvements: ADC ENOB of the THDAQ system approximately exceeds 9.8-bit, marking a 14% improvement over the CAEN DAQ system; The maximum clock deviation within a single chassis is 85.6 ps, satisfying sub-nanosecond synchronization criteria; Each DAQ board features two QSFP+ optical ports with 82.5Gbps transmission capability, while the PCIe board supports a transmission rate of 100.2 Gbps. In addition, comparative experiments between the two systems were also tested in detail. The analysis results of waveform and charge spectrum prove the high stability of the THDAQ system. This provides a foundation for the 60-channel and 4000-channel DAQ systems.</p>

<p>2024-04-17, <strong>Unlocking New Physics with Joint Power Spectrum and Voxel Intensity Distribution Forecasts in Line-Intensity Mapping</strong>, Vivian I. Sabla et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11609v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.11609v1</a></p>

<p>The power spectrum and voxel intensity distribution (VID) are two summary statistics that can be applied to condense the information encoded in line-intensity maps. The information contained in both summary statistics is highly complementary, and their combination allows for a major increase in precision of parameter estimation from line-intensity mapping (LIM) surveys. Until recently, combination of these statistics required simulation-based estimations of their covariance. In this work we leverage an analytical model of covariance between these observables to run a joint Fisher forecast focusing on the CO(1-0) rotational line targeted by the COMAP survey and a wider, shallower hypothetical iteration. We consider a generalized phenomenological non-CDM model, models with axion dark matter, and local primordial non-Gaussianity, to highlight where a combined analysis of the power spectrum and VID can be most useful. Our results demonstrate improvements in sensitivity to beyond-$\Lambda$CDM physics over analyses using either the power spectrum or VID on their own, by factors ranging from 2 to 50, showcasing the potential of joint analyses in unlocking new insights into fundamental physics with LIM surveys.</p>

<p>2024-04-17, <strong>Dark matter, black holes, and gravitational waves</strong>, Gianfranco Bertone et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11513v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.11513v1</a></p>

<p>The formation and growth of black holes can strongly influence the distribution of dark matter around them. I discuss here the different types of dark matter overdensities around black holes, including dark matter cusps, spikes, mounds, crests, and gravitational atoms. I then review recent results on the evolution of a black holes binary in presence of dark matter, focusing on the energy transfer between binary and dark matter induced by dynamical friction. Finally, I present the prospects for studying dark matter with gravitational wave observations, and argue that future interferometers might be able to detect and characterise dark matter overdensities around black holes.</p>

<p>2024-04-17, <strong>Modern tools for computing neutron star properties</strong>, Wolfgang Kastaun et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11346v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.11346v1</a></p>

<p>Astronomical observations place increasingly tighter and more diverse constraints on the properties of neutron stars (NS). Examples include observations of radio or gamma-ray pulsars, accreting neutron stars and x-ray bursts, magnetar giant flares, and recently, the gravitational waves (GW) from coalescing binary neutron stars. Computing NS properties for a given EOS, such as mass, radius, moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO), is therefore an important task. This task is unnecessarily difficult because relevant formulas are scattered throughout the literature and publicly available software tools are far from being complete and easy to use. Further, naive implementations are unreliable in numerical corner cases, most notably when using equations of state (EOS) with phase transitions. To improve the situation, we provide a public library for computing NS properties and handling of EOS data. Further, we include a collection of EOS based on existing nuclear physics models together with precomputed sequences of NS models. All methods are accessible via a Python interface. This article collects all relevant equations and numerical methods in full detail, including a novel formulation for the tidal deformability equations suitable for use with phase transitions. As a sidenote to the topic of ISCOs, we discuss the stability of non-interacting dark matter particle circular orbits inside NSs. Finally, we present some simple applications relevant for parameter estimation studies of GW data. For example, we explore the validity of universal relations, and discuss the appearance of multiple stable branches for parametrized EOS.</p>

<p>2024-04-17, <strong>Accreting Black Holes in Dark Matter Halos</strong>, Sobhan Kazempour et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11333v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.11333v1</a></p>

<p>We examine the thin accretion disk behaviors surrounding black holes embedded in cold dark matter halos and scalar field dark matter halos. We first calculate the event horizons and derive the equations of motion and effective potential in black hole geometries with different dark matter halos. We then compute the specific energy, specific angular momentum, and angular velocity of particles moving along circular orbits. We also derive the effective potentials to find the locations of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and compare them to the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes without the dark matter haloes. We also use the observed ISCO of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*, to constrain the dark matter halos and discuss the astrophysical Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) generation from systems.</p>

<p>2024-04-17, <strong>High-redshift, small-scale tests of ultralight axion dark matter using Hubble and Webb galaxy UV luminosities</strong>, Harrison Winch et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11071v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.11071v1</a></p>

<p>We calculate the abundance of UV-bright galaxies in the presence of ultralight axion dark matter (DM), finding that axions suppress their formation but with a non-trivial dependence on redshift and luminosity. We thus set the first limits on axion DM using a combination of Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) and UV luminosity function (UVLF) data. We exclude a single axion as all the DM for m_{ax} &lt; 10^{-21.6} eV and limit axions with -26 &lt; log(m_{ax}/eV) &lt; -23 to be less than 22% of the DM (both limits at 95% credibility). These limits use UVLF measurements from 24,000 sources from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that probe small-scale structure at redshifts 4 &lt; z &lt; 10 inaccessible to other cosmological observables. We marginalize over a parametric model that connects halo mass and UV luminosity that has been shown to fit the results of hydrodynamical simulations. Our results bridge a window in axion mass and DM fraction previously unconstrained by cosmological data, between large-scale CMB and galaxy clustering and the small-scale Lyman-alpha forest. These high-z measurements provide a powerful consistency check of low-z tests of axion DM, which include the recent hint for a sub-dominant ULA DM fraction in Lyman-alpha forest data. We also consider a sample of 25 spectroscopically-confirmed high-z (z &gt; 10) galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these data are consistent with the HST UVLF assuming LambdaCDM and our flexible parametric model of UV luminosity. Combining HST and JWST UVLF data does not improve our constraints beyond HST alone, but future JWST measurements have the potential to improve these results significantly. We also find an excess of low-mass halos (&lt; 10^9 M_\odot) at z &lt; 3, which could be probed by sub-galactic structure probes (e.g., stellar streams, satellite galaxies and strong lensing).</p>

<p>2024-04-17, <strong>Exploring Supermassive Compact Dark Matter with the Millilensing Effect of Gamma-Ray Bursts</strong>, Huan Zhou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11053v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.11053v1</a></p>

<p>Gravitational lensing effect is one of most significant observational probes to investigate compact dark matter/objects over a wide mass range. In this work, we first propose to derive the population information and the abundance of supermassive compact dark matter in the mass range $\sim10^5-10^7~M_{\odot}$ from 6 millilensed gamma-ray burst (GRB) candidates in 3000 Fermi GRB events using the hierarchical Bayesian inference method. We obtain that, for the mass range $\sim10^5-10^7~M_{\odot}$, the abundance of supermassive compact dark matter is $f_{\rm CO}=10^{-1.60}$ in the log-normal mass distribution scenario. This result is in obvious tension with some other observational constraints, e.g. ultra-faint dwarfs and dynamical friction. However, it also was argued that there is only one system in these 6 candidates has been identified as lensed GRB event with fairly high confidence. In this case, the tension would be significantly alleviated. Therefore, it would be an interesting clue for both the millilensed GRB identification and the formation mechanism of supermassive compact dark matter.</p>

<p>2024-04-17, <strong>Strategies for Machine Learning Applied to Noisy HEP Datasets: Modular Solid State Detectors from SuperCDMS</strong>, P. B. Cushman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10971v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.10971v1</a></p>

<p>Background reduction in the SuperCDMS dark matter experiment depends on removing surface events within individual detectors by identifying the location of each incident particle interaction. Position reconstruction is achieved by combining pulse shape information over multiple phonon channels, a task well-suited to machine learning techniques. Data from an Am-241 scan of a SuperCDMS SNOLAB detector was used to study a selection of statistical approaches, including linear regression, artificial neural networks, and symbolic regression. Our results showed that simpler linear regression models were better able than artificial neural networks to generalize on such a noisy and minimal data set, but there are indications that certain architectures and training configurations can counter overfitting tendencies. This study will be repeated on a more complete SuperCDMS data set (in progress) to explore the interplay between data quality and the application of neural networks.</p>

<p>2024-04-16, <strong>Asymmetries in invisible Dark Matter mediator production associated with $t \bar{t}$ final states</strong>, E. Chalbaud et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10852v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.10852v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we propose two sets of different CP-sensitive observables inspired by the Higgs production in association with the top quark. We employ a Dark Matter simplified model that couples a scalar particle with three generation fermions with a mass equal to that of the top quark. The reconstruction of the kinematic variables is presented at NLO accuracy for events associated with this massive scalar particle, which is assumed to be vanishing to invisible decays in a detector such as ATLAS. We build these observables by taking advantage of the similarity between the scalar coupling with the top quark and the factorization theorem in the total scattering amplitude, in order to represent the basis in which the phase space is parameterized. A twofold approach employs the direct implementation of the four-momentum phase space measure in building CP sensitive observables such as $b_{2}$ for the Higgs, and the spin polarization of the top-quark decays in the narrow width approximation for the employed model. We studied the asymmetries of these distributions to test for any improvement in increasing the exclusion region for the $g_{u_{33}}^S-g_{u_{33}}^P$ parameters associated with this vanishing scalar particle. We have found no significant effect in the exclusion limits by using the forward-backward asymmetry distributions and the full shaped ones. The best limits obtained for $g_{u_{33}}^S$ at NLO accuracy were obtained: $b_{2}:[-0.0425, 0.0475]$ $n_{4}: [-0.0450, 0.0450] $ for an invisible scalar with a mass of 10$^{-2}$ GeV for a luminosity of 300 fb$^{-1}$ expected for the end of Run 3 of the LHC.</p>

<p>2024-04-16, <strong>The Co-Evolution Between Galaxies and Dark Matter Halos</strong>, Aldo Rodriguez-Puebla et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10801v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.10801v1</a></p>

<p>The current cosmological paradigm asserts that dark matter halos provide the gravitational scaffolding for galaxy formation through a combination of hierarchical structure formation and non-linear local (g)astrophysical processes. This close relationship, known as the galaxy-halo connection, suggests that the growth and assembly of dark matter halos impact the properties of galaxies. While the stellar mass of galaxies correlates strongly with the mass of their halos, it is important to note that the galaxy-halo connection encompasses a broader distribution of galaxy and halo properties. This distribution can be constrained using data from astronomical observations and cosmological $N$-body simulations, a technique known as semi-empirical modeling. By operating at the intersection of observational data and the cosmological structure formation model, the semi-empirical modeling provides valuable insights into galaxy formation and evolution from a cosmological perspective. In this proceeding, we utilize a new sEM-emPIRical modEl, EMPIRE, to explore the star formation, SF, history of central galaxies across cosmic epochs, spanning from dwarfs to massive ellipticals. EMPIRE aims to constrain the multivariate distribution that links galaxy and halo properties. Our findings reveal distinct growth stages for progenitors of central massive galaxies. Evidence suggests that cold streams played a significant role in sustaining SF at higher $z$, while virial shock heating became more prominent at lower $z$. The maximum star formation efficiency, SFE, occurs at a factor of $\sim1.5-2$ below $M_{\rm vir \; shocks}$ for $z\lesssim1$. Furthermore, at higher redshifts, $z&gt;1$, this peak tends towards higher masses, $M_{\rm vir}\sim 2\times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. Notably, at redshifts higher than $z\sim2$, the peak of SFE aligns comfortably within the region characterized by cold streams.</p>

<p>We propose a new model of scalar field dark matter interacting with dark energy. Adopting a fluid description of the dark matter field in the regime of rapid oscillations, we find that the equation of state for dark matter is non-zero and even becomes increasingly negative at late times during dark energy domination. Furthermore, the speed of sound of dark matter is non-vanishing at all length scales, and a non-adiabatic pressure contribution arises. The results indicate that there are still unexplored possible interactions within the dark sector that lead to novel background effects and can impact structure formation processes.</p>

<p>2024-04-16, <strong>Observation of thermal microwave photons with a Josephson junction detector</strong>, A. L. Pankratov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10434v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.10434v1</a></p>

<p>When measuring electromagnetic radiation of frequency $f$, the most sensitive detector is the one that counts the single quanta of energy $h f$. Single photon detectors (SPDs) were demonstrated from $\gamma$-rays to infrared wavelengths, and extending this range down to the microwaves is the focus of intense research. The energy of $10\,\mathrm{GHz}$ microwave photon, about $40\,\mathrm{\mu eV}$ or $7\, \mathrm{yJ},$ is enough to force a superconducting Josephson junction into its resistive state, making it suitable to be used as a sensor. In this work, we use an underdamped Josephson junction to detect single thermal photons stochastically emitted by a microwave copper cavity at millikelvin temperatures. After characterizing the source and detector, we vary the temperature of the resonant cavity and measure the increased photon rate. The device shows an efficiency up to 40% and a dark count rate of $0.1\,\mathrm{Hz}$ in a bandwidth of several gigahertz. To confirm the thermal nature of the emitted photons we verify their super-Poissonian statistics, which is also a signature of quantum chaos. We discuss detector application in the scope of Dark Matter Axion searches, and note its importance for quantum information, metrology and fundamental physics.</p>

<p>2024-04-16, <strong>The evolutionary pathways of disk galaxies with different sizes</strong>, Hong-Chuan Ma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10432v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.10432v1</a></p>

<p>From the IllustrisTNG-50 simulation, a sample of 836 central disk galaxies with tiny stellar halos is chosen to study the inherent evolution of galaxies driven by nature. These galaxies are classified as compact, normal, or extended by referencing their locations on the mass-size ($M_\star-R_{\rm 1/2}$) diagram. This research demonstrates the distinctive evolutionary pathways of galaxies with different sizes in IllustrisTNG simulations, primarily driven by nature. It is confirmed that disk galaxies inherit the angular momentum of their parent dark matter halos. More compact galaxies form earlier within halos possessing lower specific angular momentum through heightened star formation during the early phase at redshifts above 2. During the later phase, the size of extended galaxies experiences more pronounced growth by accreting gas with high angular momentum. Additionally, we reveal that many key characteristics of galaxies are linked to their mass and size: (1) compact galaxies tend to exhibit higher metal content, proportional to the potential well $\frac{M_\star}{R_{\rm 1/2}}$, (2) compact galaxies host more massive bulges and black holes, and higher central concentration. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that galaxies of all types continue to actively engage in star formation, with no evident signs of quenching attributed to their varying sizes and angular momenta.</p>

<p>We present novel findings concerning the parameter space of axion stars, extended object forming in dense dark matter environments through gravitational condensation. We emphasize their formation within the dense minihalos that potentially surround primordial black holes and in axion miniclusters. Our study investigates the relation between the radius and mass of an axion star in these dense surroundings, revealing distinct morphological characteristics compared to isolated scenarios. We explore the implications of these results when applied to gravitational microlensing from extended objects and gravitational wave detection from compact binaries, leading to insights on the observational constraints from such ``halo’’ axion stars. We provide a constraint on the fraction of the galactic population of axion stars from their contribution to the microlensing events from the EROS-2 survey, using the numerical resolution of the Schr"odinger-Poisson equation.</p>

<p>2024-04-16, <strong>Majoron-Driven Leptogenesis in Gauged $U(1)_{L_μ-L_τ}$ Model</strong>, Juntaro Wada et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10283v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.10283v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a novel leptogenesis scenario in the gauged $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model. Achieving successful leptogenesis in the $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetric phase is challenging due to the absence of a CP phase, caused by restriction from the gauge symmetry. To overcome this issue, we introduce an additional global symmetry, $U(1)_{B-L}$, and a scalar field $\Phi$ responsible for breaking this symmetry. Through the kinetic misalignment mechanism, the majoron field associated with $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry breaking has a kinetic motion in the early universe. Subsequently, time-dependent majoron field background induces the background CP phase dynamically, leading to successful leptogenesis in the $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetric phase. Furthermore, majoron itself serves as a dark matter candidate in this scenario. As one of the phenomenological applications, we consider the model that can also explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly.</p>

<p>Possible light bosonic dark matter interactions with the Standard Model photon have been searched by microwave resonant cavities. In this paper, we demonstrate the cryogenic readout system calibration of a 7.138 GHz copper cavity with a loaded quality factor $Q_l=10^4$, operated at 22 mK temperature based on a dilution refrigerator. Our readout system consists of High Electron Mobility Transistors as cryogenic amplifiers at 4 K, plus room-temperature amplifiers and a spectrum analyzer for signal power detection. We test the system with a superconducting two-level system as a single-photon source in the microwave frequency regime and report an overall 95.6 dB system gain and -71.4 dB attenuation in the cavity’s input channel. The effective noise temperature of the measurement system is 7.5 K.</p>

<p>Using Ernst formalism, stationary axisymmetric black hole solution in Einstein-dark matter-dark energy gravity has been elaborated. The dark sector was chosen as dark photon concept, where an auxiliary U(1)-gauge field coupled to ordinary Maxwell one was introduced, while dark energy was modelled by the existence of positive cosmological constant. Refining our studies to the case of vanishing cosmological constant, the uniqueness theorem for the black hole in question has been proved.</p>

<p>2024-04-17, <strong>The Reliability of Type Ia Supernovae Delay Time Distributions Recovered from Galaxy Star Formation Histories</strong>, Bhavin A. Joshi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11555v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.11555v1</a></p>

<p>We present a numerical analysis investigating the reliability of type Ia supernova (SN~Ia) delay-time distributions recovered from individual host galaxy star-formation histories. We utilize star-formation histories of mock samples of galaxies generated from the IllustrisTNG simulation at two redshifts to recover delay-time distributions. The delay-time distributions are constructed through piecewise constants as opposed to typically employed parametric forms such as power-laws or Gaussian or skew/log-normal functions. The SN~Ia delay-time distributions are recovered through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration of the likelihood space by comparing the expected SN Ia rate within each mock galaxy to the observed rate. We show that a reduced representative sample of \emph{non-host} galaxies is sufficient to reliably recover delay-time distributions while simultaneously reducing the computational load. We also highlight a potential systematic between recovered delay-time distributions and the mass-weighted ages of the underlying host galaxy stellar population.</p>

<p>2024-04-17, <strong>Resolved properties of a luminous “hinge clump” in the compact group of galaxies NGC\,6845</strong>, Daniela E. Olave-Rojas et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11549v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.11549v1</a></p>

<p>We study the properties of one of the most luminous hinge clumps, located on the compact group of galaxies NGC6845. Using IFS from GMOS/Gemini, complemented with archival MUSE data, we obtain oxygen abundances, ages, star formation rates, velocity fields and we also performed a single stellar populations modeling to understand the SFH of the hinge clump localized in NGC6845. We found that the hinge clump sits in a tail, having a SFR of 3.4$M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$, which is comparable with a few other extreme cases, e.g., the star clusters in the Antennae galaxy and other reported hinge clumps in the literature. In fact, this clump represents ~15\% of total SFR of NGC6845A. Large-scale modeling of the observed velocity field of NGC6845A rules out the scenario on which this hinge clump was a satellite galaxy. Indeed, its kinematics is compatible with the galactic disk of NGC6845A. Its abundance, mean value of 0.4Z$_{\odot}$, is also consistent with the metallicity gradient of the galaxy. Our analysis, suggest that the hinge clump is formed by multiple stellar populations instead of a single burst, thus having a large range of ages. We found that central clump is encompassed by a ring-like structure, suggesting that the ring-like structure represents a second-generation of star formation. In addition, the analysis of the diagnostic diagram indicates that this central region can also be being ionized by shock from stellar and supernovae winds. Finally, the derived SFR density $\Sigma=9.7M_{\odot}yr^{-1}kpc^{-2}$ of the central clump, place it in starburst regime, where gas inflows should provide gas to maintain the star formation. This work shows a resolved example of an extreme localized starburst in a compact group of galaxies.</p>

<p>2024-04-17, <strong>How robust are the parameter constraints extending the $Λ$CDM model?</strong>, Stefano Gariazzo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11182v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.11182v1</a></p>

<p>We present model-marginalized limits on the six standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters ($\Omega_{\rm c} h^2$, $\Omega_{\rm b} h^2$, $\theta_{\rm MC}$, $\tau_{\rm reio}$, $n_s$ and $A_s$), as well as on selected derived quantities ($H_0$, $\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\sigma_8$, $S_8$ and $r_{\rm drag}$), obtained by considering three independent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments: the Planck satellite, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and South Pole Telescope. We also consider low redshift observations in the form of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS-IV eBOSS survey and Supernovae (SN) distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon-Plus catalog. The marginalized errors are stable against the different fiducial cosmologies explored in this study. The largest impact on the parameter accuracy is produced by varying the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm eff}$) or the lensing amplitude ($A_{\rm lens}$). Nevertheless the marginalized errors on some derived parameters such as $H_0$ or $\Omega_{\rm m}$ can be up to two orders of magnitude larger than in the canonical $\Lambda$CDM scenario when considering only CMB data. In these cases, low redshift measurements are crucial for restoring the stability of the marginalized cosmological errors computed here. Overall, our results underscore remarkable stability in the mean values and precision of the main cosmological parameters, making irrelevant the choice of different possible cosmological scenarios once both high and low redshift probes are fully accounted for. The very same results should be understood as a tool to test exotic cosmological scenarios, as the marginalized values should be used in numerical analyses due to their robustness and slightly larger errors, providing a more realistic and conservative approach.</p>

<p>2024-04-17, <strong>Search for synchrotron emission from secondary electrons of proton-proton interaction in Galactic PeVatron candidate HESS J1641$-$463</strong>, Naomi Tsuji et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11012v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.11012v1</a></p>

<p>HESS J1641-463 is an unidentified gamma-ray source with a hard TeV gamma-ray spectrum, and thus it has been proposed to be a possible candidate for cosmic ray (CR) accelerators up to PeV energies (a PeVatron candidate). The source spatially coincides with the radio supernova remnant (SNR) G338.5+0.1, but has not yet been fully explored in the X-ray band. We analyzed newly taken NuSTAR data, pointing at HESS J1641-463, with 82 ks effective exposure time. There is no apparent X-ray counterpart of HESS J1641-463, while nearby stellar cluster, Mercer 81, and stray-light X-rays are detected. Combined with the archival Chandra data, partially covering the source, we derived an upper limit of $\sim 6\times 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in 2-10 keV ($\sim 3\times 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in 10-20 keV). If the gamma-ray emission is originated from decay of $\pi^0$ mesons produced in interactions between CR protons and ambient materials, secondary electrons in the proton-proton interactions can potentially emit synchrotron photons in the X-ray band, which can be tested by our X-ray observations. Although the obtained X-ray upper limits cannot place a constraint on the primary proton spectrum, it will be possible with a future hard X-ray mission.</p>

<p>2024-04-16, <strong>Stripped-envelope supernova light curves argue for central engine activity</strong>, Ósmar Rodríguez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10846v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.10846v1</a></p>

<p>The luminosity of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stripped-envelope supernovae'', a common type of stellar explosions, has been generally thought to be driven by the radioactive decay of the nickel synthesized in the explosion and carried in its ejecta. Additional possible energy sources have been previously suggested, but these claims have been statistically inconclusive or model-dependent. Here, we analyse the energy budget of a sample of 54 well-observed stripped-envelope supernovae of all sub-types, and present statistically significant, largely model-independent, observational evidence for a non-radioactive power source in most of them (and possibly in all). We consider various energy sources, or alternatively, plausible systematic errors, that could drive this result, and conclude that the most likely option is the existence of a</code>central engine’’, such as a magnetar (a highly magnetic neutron star) or an accreting neutron star or black hole, operating over hours to days after the explosion. We infer from the observations constraints on the engines, finding that if these are magnetars, then their initial magnetic fields are about $10^{15}\,$G and their initial rotation period is 1–100 ms, implying that stripped-envelope supernovae could be the formative events of magnetars.</p>

<p>2024-04-16, <strong>H-alpha emission and HII regions at the locations of recent supernovae in nearby galaxies</strong>, Ness Mayker Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10762v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.10762v1</a></p>

<p>We present a statistical analysis of the local, approximately 50-100 pc scale, H-alpha emission at the locations of recent (less than 125 years) supernovae (SNe) in nearby star-forming galaxies. Our sample consists of 32 SNe in 10 galaxies that are targets of the PHANGS-MUSE survey. We find that 41% (13/32) of these SNe occur coincident with a previously identified HII region. For comparison, HII regions cover 32% of the area within 1 kpc of any recent SN. Contrasting this local covering fraction with the fraction of SNe coincident with HII regions, we find a statistical excess of 7.6% +/- 8.7% of all SNe to be associated with HII regions. This increases to an excess of 19.2% +/- 10.4% when considering only core-collapse SNe. These estimates appear to be in good agreement with qualitative results from new, higher resolution HST H-alpha imaging, which also suggest many CCSNe detonate near but not in HII regions. Our results appear consistent with the expectation that only a modest fraction of stars explode during the first 5 Myr of the life of a stellar population, when H-alpha emission is expected to be bright. Of the HII region associated SNe, 8% (11/13) also have associated detected CO(2-1) emission, indicating the presence of molecular gas. The HII region associated SNe have typical Av extinctions approximately equal to 1 mag, consistent with a significant amount of pre-clearing of gas from the region before the SNe explode.</p>

<p>2024-04-16, <strong>EPOCHS III: Unbiased UV continuum slopes at 6.5&lt;z&lt;13 from combined PEARLS GTO and public JWST NIRCam imaging</strong>, Duncan Austin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10751v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.10751v1</a></p>

<p>We present an analysis of rest-frame UV continuum slopes, $\beta$, using a sample of 1011 galaxies at $6.5&lt;z&lt;13$ from the EPOCHS photometric sample collated from the GTO PEARLS and public ERS/GTO/GO (JADES, CEERS, NGDEEP, GLASS) JWST NIRCam imaging across $178.9~\mathrm{arcmin}^2$ of unmasked blank sky. We correct our UV slopes for the photometric error coupling bias using $200,000$ power law SEDs for each $\beta={-1,-1.5,-2,-2.5,-3}$ in each field, finding biases as large as $\Delta\beta\simeq-0.55$ for the lowest SNR galaxies in our sample. Additionally, we simulate the impact of rest-UV line emission (including Ly$\alpha$) and damped Ly$\alpha$ systems on our measured $\beta$, finding biases as large as $0.5-0.6$ for the most extreme systems. We find a decreasing trend with redshift of $\beta=-1.51\pm0.08-(0.097\pm0.010)\times z$, with potential evidence for Pop.~III stars or top-heavy initial mass functions (IMFs) in a subsample of 68 $\beta+\sigma_{\beta}&lt;-2.8$ galaxies. At $z\simeq11.5$, we measure an extremely blue $\beta(M_{\mathrm{UV}}=-19)=-2.73\pm0.06$, deviating from simulations, indicative of low-metallicity galaxies with non-zero Lyman continuum escape fractions $f_{\mathrm{esc, LyC}}\gtrsim0$ and minimal dust content. The observed steepening of $\mathrm{d}\beta/\mathrm{d}\log_{10}(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})$ from $0.22\pm0.02$ at $z=7$ to $0.81\pm0.13$ at $z=11.5$ implies that dust produced in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) at early times may be ejected via outflows from low mass galaxies. We also observe a flatter $\mathrm{d}\beta/\mathrm{d}M_{\mathrm{UV}}=0.03\pm0.02$ at $z=7$ and a shallower $\mathrm{d}\beta/\mathrm{d}\log_{10}(M_{\star} / \mathrm{M}_{\odot})$ at $z&lt;11$ than seen by HST, unveiling a new population of low mass, faint, galaxies reddened by dust produced in the stellar winds of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars or carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet binaries.</p>

<p>2024-04-16, <strong>Formation of GW230529 from Isolated Binary Evolution and Its Electromagnetic Counterparts</strong>, Jin-Ping Zhu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10596v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.10596v1</a></p>

<p>In this {\em Letter}, we explore the formation of the mass-gap black hole-neutron star (mgBHNS) merger detected in gravitational wave (GW) event, i.e., GW230529, from the isolated binary evolution channel, and study potential signatures of its electromagnetic signals. By adopting the `delayed’ supernova prescription and reasonable model realizations, our population synthesis simulation results can simultaneously match the inferred event rate densities of GW230529-like mgBHNS and total BHNS mergers, as well as the population distribution of the BH mass in BHNS mergers reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Thus, we conclude that the recently-discovered mgBHNS merger, GW230529, can be explained through the isolated binary evolution channel. Considering the equation of states of AP4 and DD2, the probabilities that GW230529 can make tidal disruption are $12.8\%$ and $63.2\%$, respectively. If GW230529 is a disrupted event, the associated kilonova is predicted to have an apparent magnitude of $\sim23-24\,{\rm{mag}}$, and hence, can be detected by the present survey projects and LSST. Since GW230529 could be an off-axis event inferred from the GW observation, its associated gamma-ray burst (GRB) might be too dim to be observed by $\gamma$-ray detectors, interpreting the lack of GRB observations. The detection of GW230529 confirms the existence of mgBHNS mergers formed through the isolated binary evolution channel, suggesting that BHNS mergers are still likely to be multimessenger sources that emit GWs, GRBs, and kilonovae. Although mgBHNS mergers account for $\sim60\%$ cosmological BHNS population, we find that $\gtrsim90\%$ disrupted BHNS mergers are expected to originate from mgBHNS mergers.</p>

<p>2024-04-16, <strong>Impacts of stellar wind and supernovae on the star cluster formation: origins of extremely high N/O ratios and multiple stellar populations</strong>, Hajime Fukushima et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10535v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.10535v1</a></p>

<p>We study metal enrichment originating from stellar wind and supernovae in low-metallicity clouds by performing three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We find that metals ejected from stellar wind are accumulated, leading to subsequent star formation in the nitrogen-enriched gas. During this early phase, the N/O ratios are similar to observed nitrogen-enriched galaxies (${\rm [N/O]}\gtrsim0.5$). Then, once supernovae occur, the N/O ratios decrease significantly. If the duration of star formation is comparable to the timescale of SNe, the mass fraction of nitrogen-enriched stars reaches half the mass of star clusters. We suggest that the mass of the star cluster needs to exceed $\sim 10^6~M_{\odot}$ to have multiple populations due to stellar wind, considering the condition for massive star cluster formation and the timescales of stellar evolution.</p>
