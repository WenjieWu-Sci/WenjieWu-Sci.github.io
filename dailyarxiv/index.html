<p>2023-11-13, <strong>Probing Dirac Neutrino Properties with Dilepton Signature</strong>, Wan-Lun Xu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07109v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.07109v1</a></p>

<p>The neutrinophilic two Higgs doublet model is one of the simplest models to explain the origin of tiny Dirac neutrino masses. This model introduces a new Higgs doublet with eV scale VEV to naturally generate the tiny neutrino masses. Depending on the same Yukawa coupling, the neutrino oscillation patterns can be probed with the dilepton signature from the decay of charged scalar $H^\pm$. For example, the normal hierarchy predicts BR$(H^+\to e^+\nu)\ll$ BR$(H^+\to \mu^+\nu)\approx$ BR$(H^+\to \tau^+\nu)\simeq0.5$ when the lightest neutrino mass is below 0.01 eV, while the inverted hierarchy predicts BR$(H^+\to e^+\nu)/2\simeq$ BR$(H^+\to \mu^+\nu)\simeq$ BR$(H^+\to \tau^+\nu)\simeq0.25$. By precise measurement of BR$(H^+\to \ell^+\nu)$, we are hopefully to probe the lightest neutrino mass and the atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$. Through the detailed simulation of the dilepton signature and corresponding backgrounds, we find that the 3 TeV CLIC could discover $M_{H^+}\lesssim1220$ GeV for NH and $M_{H^+}\lesssim1280$ GeV for IH. Meanwhile, the future 100 TeV FCC-hh collider could probe $M_{H^+}\lesssim1810$ GeV for NH and $M_{H^+}\lesssim2060$ GeV for IH.</p>

<p>2023-11-13, <strong>Modeling biases from constant stellar mass-to-light ratio assumption in galaxy dynamics and strong lensing</strong>, Yan Liang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07442v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.07442v1</a></p>

<p>A constant stellar-mass to light ratio $M_{\star}/L$ has been widely-used in studies of galaxy dynamics and strong lensing, which aim at disentangling the mass density distributions of dark matter and baryons. In this work, we take early-type galaxies from the cosmological hydrodynamic IllustrisTNG-100 simulation to investigate possible systematic bias in the inferences due to a constant $M_{\star}/L$ assumption. To do so, we construct two-component matter density models, where one component describes the dark matter distribution, the other one for the stellar mass, which is made to follow the light profile by assuming a constant factor of $M_{\star}/L$. Specifically, we adopt multiple commonly used dark matter models and light distributions. We fit the two-component models directly to the {\it total} matter density distributions of simulated galaxies to eliminate systematics from other modelling procedures. We find that galaxies in general have more centrally-concentrated stellar mass profile than their light distribution. This is more significant among more massive galaxies, for which the $M_{\star}/L$ profile rises up markedly towards the centre and may often exhibit a dented feature due to on-going star formation at about one effective radius, encompassing a quenched bulge region. As a consequence, a constant $M_{\star}/L$ causes a model degeneracy to be artificially broken under specific model assumptions, resulting in strong and model-dependent biases on estimated properties, such as the central dark matter fraction and the initial mass function. Either a steeper dark matter profile with an over-predicted density fraction, or an over-predicted stellar mass normalization ($M_{\star}/L$) is often obtained through model fitting. The exact biased behaviour depends on the slope difference between mass and light, as well as on the adopted models for dark matter and light.</p>

<p>DarkSide-20k will be the next liquid argon TPC built to perform direct search for dark matter under the form of WIMPs. Its calibration to both signal and backgrounds is key as very few events are expected in WIMPs search. In the following proceeding, aspects of the calibration of the TPC of DarkSide-20k are presented: the calibration system itself, the simulations of the calibration programs and the simulations of the impact of the calibration system on the rest of the detector (reduction of the light collection efficiency in the veto buffer, induced background by the system in the TPC and veto).</p>

<p>2023-11-13, <strong>The H0 trouble: Confronting Non-thermal Dark Matter and Phantom Cosmology with the CMB, BAO, and Type Ia Supernovae data</strong>, Simony S da Costa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07420v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.07420v1</a></p>

<p>We have witnessed different values of the Hubble constant being found in the literature in the past years. Albeit, early measurements often result in an $H_0$ much smaller than those from late-time ones, producing a statistically significant discrepancy, and giving rise to the so-called Hubble tension. The trouble with the Hubble constant is often treated as a cosmological problem. However, the Hubble constant can be a laboratory to probe cosmology and particle physics models. In our work, we will investigate if the possibility of explaining the $H_0$ trouble using non-thermal dark matter production aided by phantom-like cosmology is consistent with the Cosmic Background Radiation (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data. We performed a full Monte Carlo simulation using CMB and BAO datasets keeping the cosmological parameters $\Omega_b h^2$, $\Omega_c h^2$, $100\theta$, $\tau_{opt}$, and $w$ as priors and concluded that a non-thermal dark matter production aided by phantom-like cosmology yields at most $H_0=70.5$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ which is consistent with some late-time measurements. However, if $H_0&gt; 72$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ as many late-time observations indicate, an alternative solution to the Hubble trouble is needed. Lastly, we limited the fraction of relativistic dark matter at the matter-radiation equality to be at most 1\%.</p>

<p>2023-11-13, <strong>An Empirical Model For Intrinsic Alignments: Insights From Cosmological Simulations</strong>, Nicholas Van Alfen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07374v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.07374v1</a></p>

<p>We extend current models of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) to include a flexible, empirical framework for the forward modeling of the intrinsic alignment (IA) of galaxies. A primary goal of this work is to produce mock galaxy catalogs for the purpose of validating existing models and methods for the mitigation of IA in weak lensing measurements. This technique can also be used to produce new, simulation-based predictions for IA and galaxy clustering. Our model is probabilistically formulated, and rests upon the assumption that the orientations of galaxies exhibit a correlation with their host dark matter (sub)halo orientation or with their position within the halo. We examine the necessary components and phenomenology of such a model by considering the alignments between (sub)halos in a cosmological dark matter only simulation. We then validate this model for a realistic galaxy population in a set of simulations in the Illustris-TNG suite. We create an HOD mock with Illustris-like correlations using our method, constraining the associated IA model parameters, with the $\chi^2_{\rm dof}$ between our modelâs correlations and those of Illustris matching as closely as 1.4 and 1.1 for orientationâposition and orientationâorientation correlation functions, respectively. By modeling the misalignment between galaxies and their host halo, we show that the 3-dimensional two-point position and orientation correlation functions of simulated (sub)halos and galaxies can be accurately reproduced from quasi-linear scales down to $0.1~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. We also find evidence for environmental influence on IA within a halo. Our publicly-available software provides a key component enabling efficient determination of Bayesian posteriors on IA model parameters using observational measurements of galaxy-orientation correlation functions in the highly nonlinear regime.</p>

<p>2023-11-13, <strong>Detector development for the CRESST experiment</strong>, G. Angloher et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07318v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.07318v1</a></p>

<p>Recently low-mass dark matter direct searches have been hindered by a low energy background, drastically reducing the physics reach of the experiments. In the CRESST-III experiment, this signal is characterised by a significant increase of events below 200 eV. As the origin of this background is still unknown, it became necessary to develop new detector designs to reach a better understanding of the observations. Within the CRESST collaboration, three new different detector layouts have been developed and they are presented in this contribution.</p>

<p>2023-11-13, <strong>Neutron calibrations in dark matter searches: the ANAIS-112 case</strong>, T. Pardo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07290v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.07290v1</a></p>

<p>ANAIS is a direct dark matter detection experiment whose goal is to confirm or refute in a model independent way the positive annual modulation signal claimed by DAMA/LIBRA. Consisting of 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) scintillators, ANAIS-112 is taking data at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory in Spain since August, 2017. Results corresponding to the analysis of three years of data are compatible with the absence of modulation and incompatible with DAMA/LIBRA. However, testing this signal relies on the knowledge of the scintillation quenching factors (QF), which measure the relative efficiency for the conversion into light of the nuclear recoil energy with respect to the same energy deposited by electrons. Previous measurements of the QF in NaI(Tl) show a large dispersion. Consequently, in order to better understand the response of the ANAIS-112 detectors to nuclear recoils, a specific neutron calibration program has been developed. This program combines two different approaches: on the one hand, QF measurements were carried out in a monoenergetic neutron beam; on the other hand, the study presented here aims at the evaluation of the QF by exposing directly the ANAIS-112 crystals to neutrons from low activity $^{252}$Cf sources, placed outside the lead shielding. Comparison between these onsite neutron measurements and detailed GEANT4 simulations will be presented, confirming that this approach allows testing different QF models.</p>

<p>2023-11-13, <strong>Quantum measurements in fundamental physics: a userâs manual</strong>, Jacob Beckey et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07270v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.07270v1</a></p>

<p>We give a systematic theoretical treatment of linear quantum detectors used in modern high energy physics experiments, including dark matter cavity haloscopes, gravitational wave detectors, and impulsive mechanical sensors. We show how to derive the coupling of signals of interest to these devices, and how to calculate noise spectra, signal-to-noise ratios, and detection sensitivities. We emphasize the role of quantum vacuum and thermal noise in these systems. Finally, we review ways in which advanced quantum techniques â squeezing, non-demolition measurements, and entanglement â can be or currently are used to enhance these searches.</p>

<p>2023-11-13, <strong>Testing Millisecond Pulsars as the Source of the Galactic Center Excess Gamma-Ray emission</strong>, Yi Xing et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07205v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.07205v1</a></p>

<p>The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) $\gamma$-ray emission detected with the Large Area Telescope onboard the {\it Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope} has been considered as a possible sign for dark matter (DM) annihilation, but other possibilities such as the millisecond pulsar (MSP) origin have also been suggested. As a spectral fitting method, constructed based on properties of $\gamma$-ray MSPs, has been developed, we apply this method to the study of the GCE emission for the purpose of probing the MSP origin for the GCE. A number of $\sim$1660 MSPs can provide a fit to the spectrum of the GCE emission upto $\sim$10\,GeV, but the higher energy part of the spectrum requires additional emission components. We further carry out a stacking analysis of 30â500\,GeV data for relatively nearby $\gamma$-ray MSPs, and the resulting flux upper limits are still lower than those of the GCE emission. We consider the single DM annihilation channel $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ or channel $b\bar{b}$,or the combination of the two for comparison, and find they generally can provide better fits than MSPs. Combination of MSPs plus a DM channel are also tested, and MSPs plus the DM channel $b\bar{b}$ can always provide better fits. Comparing this combination case to the pure DM channel $b\bar{b}$, the MSP contribution is found to be marginally needed.</p>

<p>2023-11-13, <strong>Galactoseismology in cosmological simulations: Vertical perturbations by dark matter, satellite galaxies and gas</strong>, B. GarcÃ­a-Conde et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07137v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.07137v1</a></p>

<p>Only recently, complex models that include the global dynamics from dwarf satellite galaxies, dark matter halo structure, gas infalls, and stellar disk in a cosmological context became available to study the dynamics of disk galaxies such as the Milky Way (MW). We use a MW model from a high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation named GARROTXA to establish the relationship between the vertical disturbances seen in its galactic disk and multiple perturbations, from the dark matter halo, satellites and gas.   We calculate the bending modes in the galactic disk in the last 6 Gyr of evolution. To quantify the impact of dark matter and gas we compute the vertical acceleration exerted by these components onto the disk and compare them with the bending behavior with Fourier analysis. We find complex bending patterns at different radii and times, such as an inner retrograde mode with high frequency, as well as an outer slower retrograde mode excited at different times. The amplitudes of these bending modes are highest during the early stages of the thin disk formation and reach up to 8.5 km s-1 in the late disk evolution. We find that the infall of satellite galaxies leads to a tilt of the disk, and produces anisotropic gas accretion with subsequent star formation events, and supernovae, creating significant vertical accelerations onto the disk plane. The misalignment between the disk and the inner stellar/dark matter triaxial structure, formed during the ancient assembly of the galaxy, creates a strong vertical acceleration on the stars.   We conclude that several agents trigger the bending of the stellar disk and its phase spirals in this simulation, including satellite galaxies, dark sub-halos, misaligned gaseous structures, and the inner dark matter profile, which coexist and influence each other, making it challenging to establish direct causality.</p>

<p>2023-11-13, <strong>HESS J1809-193: Gamma-Ray Emission by Cosmic Rays from Past Explosion</strong>, Sovan Boxi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07481v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.07481v1</a></p>

<p>The very high energy gamma-ray source HESS J1809-193 has been detected by the LHAASO and HAWC observatory beyond 100 TeV energy. It is an interesting candidate for exploring the underlying mechanisms of gamma-ray production due to the presence of supernova remnants, pulsar and molecular clouds close to it. We have considered the injection of the energetic cosmic rays from a past explosion, whose reminiscent may be SNR G011.0-00.0, which is located within the extended gamma-ray source HESS J1809-193. We explain the multi-wavelength data from the region of HESS J1809-193 with synchrotron, inverse Compton, bremsstrahlung emission of cosmic ray electrons and secondary gamma-ray production in interactions of cosmic ray protons with the cold protons in the local molecular clouds within a time-dependent framework including the diffusion loss of cosmic rays. The observational data has been modelled with the secondary photons produced by the time-evolved cosmic ray spectrum, assuming the age of the explosion is 4500 years.</p>

<p>2023-11-13, <strong>Evolution and final fate of massive post-common-envelope binaries</strong>, Dandan Wei et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07278v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.07278v1</a></p>

<p>Mergers of neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) are nowadays observed routinely thanks to gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. In the isolated binary-evolution channel, a common-envelope (CE) phase of a red supergiant (RSG) and a compact object is crucial to sufficiently shrink the orbit and thereby enable a merger via GW emission. Here, we use the outcomes of two three-dimensional (3D) magneto-hydrodynamic CE simulations of an initially 10.0 solar-mass RSG with a 5.0 solar-mass BH and a 1.4 solar-mass NS, respectively, to explore the further evolution and final fate of the post-CE binaries. Notably, the 3D simulations reveal that the post-CE binaries are likely surrounded by circumbinary disks (CBDs), which contain substantial mass and angular momentum to influence the subsequent evolution. The binary systems in MESA modelling undergo another phase of mass transfer (MT) and we find that most donor stars do not explode in ultra-stripped supernovae (SNe), but rather in Type Ib/c SNe. The final orbits of our models with the BH companion are too wide, and NS kicks are actually required to sufficiently perturb the orbit and thus facilitate a merger via GW emission. Moreover, by exploring the influence of CBDs, we find that mass accretion from the disk widens the binary orbit, while CBD-binary resonant interactions can shrink the separation and increase the eccentricity depending on the disk mass and lifetime. Efficient resonant contractions may even enable NS/BH to merge with the remnant He stars before a second SN explosion, which may be observed as gamma-ray burst-like transients, luminous fast blue optical transients and Thorne-.Zytkow objects. For the surviving post-CE binaries, the CBD-binary interactions may significantly increase the GW-induced double compact merger fraction. We conclude that accounting for CBD may be crucial to better understand observed GW mergers.</p>

<p>Only recently, complex models that include the global dynamics from dwarf satellite galaxies, dark matter halo structure, gas infalls, and stellar disk in a cosmological context became available to study the dynamics of disk galaxies such as the Milky Way (MW). We use a MW model from a high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation named GARROTXA to establish the relationship between the vertical disturbances seen in its galactic disk and multiple perturbations, from the dark matter halo, satellites and gas.   We calculate the bending modes in the galactic disk in the last 6 Gyr of evolution. To quantify the impact of dark matter and gas we compute the vertical acceleration exerted by these components onto the disk and compare them with the bending behavior with Fourier analysis. We find complex bending patterns at different radii and times, such as an inner retrograde mode with high frequency, as well as an outer slower retrograde mode excited at different times. The amplitudes of these bending modes are highest during the early stages of the thin disk formation and reach up to 8.5 km s-1 in the late disk evolution. We find that the infall of satellite galaxies leads to a tilt of the disk, and produces anisotropic gas accretion with subsequent star formation events, and supernovae, creating significant vertical accelerations onto the disk plane. The misalignment between the disk and the inner stellar/dark matter triaxial structure, formed during the ancient assembly of the galaxy, creates a strong vertical acceleration on the stars.   We conclude that several agents trigger the bending of the stellar disk and its phase spirals in this simulation, including satellite galaxies, dark sub-halos, misaligned gaseous structures, and the inner dark matter profile, which coexist and influence each other, making it challenging to establish direct causality.</p>
