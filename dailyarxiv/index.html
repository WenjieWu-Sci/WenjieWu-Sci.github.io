<p>2023-11-01, <strong>Dark Matter in A Mirror Solution to the Strong CP Problem</strong>, Quentin Bonnefoy et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00702v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.00702v1</a></p>

<p>We study thermal production of dark matter (DM) in a realization of the minimal models of Ref.\cite{Bonnefoy:2023afx}, where parity is used to solve the strong CP problem by transforming the entire Standard Model (SM) into a mirror copy. Although the mirror electron $e^{\prime}$ is a good DM candidate, its viability is mired by the presence of the mirror up-quark $u^{\prime}$, whose abundance is intimately related to the $e^{\prime}$ abundance and must be suppressed. This can be achieved through a sequential freeze-in mechanism, where mirror photons are first produced from SM gluons, and then the mirror photons produce $e’$. After computing the details of this double freeze-in, we discuss the allowed parameter space of the model, which lies at the threshold of experimental observations. We find that this origin of $e’$ DM requires a low reheating temperature after inflation and is consistent with the baryon asymmetry arising from leptogenesis, providing mirror neutrinos have a significant degeneracy. Finally, we show that this $e’$ DM is not compatible with Higgs Parity, the simplest scheme with exact parity, unless SM parameters deviate significantly from their central values or the minimal model is extended.</p>

<p>2023-11-01, <strong>Search for new particles at the ILC</strong>, María Teresa Núñez Pardo de Vera et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00525v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.00525v1</a></p>

<p>Although the LHC experiments have searched for and excluded many proposed new particles up to masses close to 1 TeV, there are many scenarios that are difficult to address at a hadron collider. This talk will review a number of these scenarios and present the expectations for searches at an electron-positron collider such as the International Linear Collider. The cases discussed include SUSY in strongly or moderately compressed models, heavy neutrinos, heavy vector bosons coupling to the s-channel in $e^+e^-$ annihilation, and new scalars.</p>

<p>2023-11-01, <strong>The origin of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos: new results and prospects</strong>, Sergey Troitsky et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00281v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.00281v1</a></p>

<p>High-energy neutrino astrophysics is rapidly developing, and in the last two years, new and exciting results have been obtained. Among them are the confirmation of the existence of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux by the new independent Baikal-GVD experiment, the discovery of the neutrino emission of our Galaxy, new confirmations of the origin of a part of astrophysical neutrinos in blazars, and much more. This brief review, based on the author’s presentation at the session of the RAS Physical Science Division “Gamma quanta and neutrinos from space: what we can see now and what we need to see more”, summarizes the results obtained since the publication of the review arXiv:2112.09611, and can be considered as a companion to it.</p>

<p>2023-10-31, <strong>Comprehensive constraints on heavy sterile neutrinos from core-collapse supernovae</strong>, Pierluca Carenza et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00033v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.00033v1</a></p>

<p>Sterile neutrinos with masses up to $\mathcal{O} (100)$ MeV can be copiously produced in a supernova (SN) core, through the mixing with active neutrinos. In this regard the SN 1987A detection of neutrino events has been used to put constraints on active-sterile neutrino mixing, exploiting the well-known SN cooling argument. We refine the calculation of this limit including neutral current interactions with nucleons, that constitute the dominant channel for sterile neutrino production. We also include, for the first time, the charged current interactions between sterile neutrinos and muons, relevant for the production of sterile neutrinos mixed with muon neutrinos in the SN core. Using the recent modified luminosity criterion, we extend the bounds to the case where sterile states are trapped in the stellar core. Additionally, we study the decays of heavy sterile neutrinos, affecting the SN explosion energy and possibly producing a gamma-ray signal. We also illustrate the complementarity of our new bounds with cosmological bounds and laboratory searches.</p>

<p>2023-10-31, <strong>Neutrino trapping and out-of-equilibrium effects in binary neutron star merger remnants</strong>, Pedro Luis Espino et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00031v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.00031v1</a></p>

<p>We study out-of-thermodynamic equilibrium effects in neutron star mergers with 3D general-relativistic neutrino-radiation large-eddy simulations. During merger, the cores of the neutron stars remain cold ($T \sim$ a few MeV) and out of thermodynamic equilibrium with trapped neutrinos originating from the hot collisional interface between the stars. However, within ${\sim}2{-}3$ milliseconds matter and neutrinos reach equilibrium everywhere in the remnant. Our results show that dissipative effects, such as bulk viscosity, if present, are only active for a short window of time after the merger.</p>

<p>2023-10-31, <strong>Heavy Baryon Dark Matter from $SU(N)$ Confinement: Bubble Wall Velocity and Boundary Effects</strong>, Yann Gouttenoire et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00029v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.00029v1</a></p>

<p>Confinement in $SU(N_{\rm DC})$ Yang-Mills theories is known to proceed through first-order phase transition. The wall velocity is bounded by $v_w \lesssim 10^{-6}$ due to the needed time for the substantial latent heat released during the phase transition to dissipate through Hubble expansion. Quarks much heavier than the confinement scale can be introduced without changing the confinement dynamics. After they freeze-out, heavy quarks are squeezed into pockets of the deconfined phase until they completely annihilate with anti-quarks. We calculate the dark baryon abundance surviving annihilation, due to bound-state formation occurring both in the bulk and - for the first time - at the boundary. We find that dark baryons can be dark matter with a mass up to $10^3~\rm TeV$. We study indirect and direct detection, CMB and BBN probes, assuming portals to Higgs and neutrinos.</p>

<p>2023-10-31, <strong>Phenomenology of Lepton Masses and Mixing with Discrete Flavor Symmetries</strong>, Garv Chauhan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20681v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.20681v1</a></p>

<p>The observed pattern of fermion masses and mixing is an outstanding puzzle in particle physics, generally known as the flavor problem. Over the years, guided by precision neutrino oscillation data, discrete flavor symmetries have often been used to explain the neutrino mixing parameters, which look very different from the quark sector. In this review, we discuss the application of non-Abelian finite groups to the theory of neutrino masses and mixing in the light of current and future neutrino oscillation data. We start with an overview of the neutrino mixing parameters, comparing different global fit results and limits on normal and inverted neutrino mass ordering schemes. Then, we discuss a general framework for implementing discrete family symmetries to explain neutrino masses and mixing. We discuss CP violation effects, giving an update of CP predictions for trimaximal models with nonzero reactor mixing angle and models with partial $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry, and constraining models with neutrino mass sum rules. The connection between texture zeroes and discrete symmetries is also discussed. We summarize viable higher-order groups, which can explain the observed pattern of lepton mixing where the non-zero $\theta_{13}$ plays an important role. We also review the prospects of embedding finite discrete symmetries in the Grand Unified Theories and with extended Higgs fields. Models based on modular symmetry are also briefly discussed. A major part of the review is dedicated to the phenomenology of flavor symmetries and possible signatures in the current and future experiments at the intensity, energy, and cosmic frontiers. In this context, we discuss flavor symmetry implications for neutrinoless double beta decay, collider signals, leptogenesis, dark matter, as well as gravitational waves.</p>

<p>2023-10-31, <strong>On the possible jet contribution to the $γ$-ray luminosity in NGC 1068</strong>, S. Salvatore et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20629v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.20629v1</a></p>

<p>NGC 1068 is a nearby widely studied Seyfert II galaxy presenting radio, infrared, X- and $\gamma$-ray emission as well as strong evidence for high-energy neutrino emission. Recently, the evidence for neutrino emission could be explained in a multimessenger model in which the neutrinos originate from the corona of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). In this environment $\gamma$-rays are strongly absorbed, so that an additional contribution from e.g. the circumnuclear starburst ring is necessary. In this work, we discuss whether the radio jet can be an alternative source of the $\gamma$-rays between about $0.1$ and $100$ GeV as observed by Fermi-LAT. In particular, we include both leptonic and hadronic processes, i.e. accounting for inverse Compton emission and signatures from $pp$ as well as $p\gamma$ interactions. In order to constrain our calculations, we use VLBA and ALMA observations of the radio knot structures, which are spatially resolved at different distances from the supermassive black hole. Our results show that the best leptonic scenario for the prediction of the Fermi-LAT data is provided by the radio knot closest to the central engine. For that a magnetic field strength $\sim 1\,\text{mG}$ is needed as well as a strong spectral softening of the relativistic electron distribution at $(1-10)\,\text{GeV}$. However, we show that neither such a weak magnetic field strength nor such a strong softening is expected for that knot. A possible explanation for the $\sim$ 10 GeV $\gamma$-rays can be provided by hadronic pion production in case of a gas density $\gtrsim 10^4\,\text{cm}^{-3}$. Nonetheless, this process cannot contribute significantly to the low energy end of the Fermi-LAT range. We conclude that the emission sites in the jet are not able to explain the $\gamma$-rays in the whole Fermi-LAT energy band.</p>

<p>2023-10-31, <strong>A New Kilohertz Gravitational-Wave Feature from Rapidly Rotating Core-Collapse Supernovae</strong>, He-Feng Hsieh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20411v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.20411v1</a></p>

<p>We present self-consistent three-dimensional core-collapse supernova simulations of a rotating $20M_\odot$ progenitor model with various initial angular velocities from $0.0$ to $4.0$ rad s$^{-1}$ using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, SPHYNX, and a grid-based hydrodynamics code, FLASH. We identify two strong gravitational-wave features, with peak frequencies of $\sim300$ Hz and $\sim1.3$ kHz in the first $100$ ms postbounce. We demonstrate that these two features are associated with the $m=1$ deformation from the proto-neutron star (PNS) modulation induced by the low-$T/|W|$ instability, regardless of the simulation code. The $300$ Hz feature is present in models with an initial angular velocity between $1.0$ and $4.0$ rad s$^{-1}$, while the $1.3$ kHz feature is present only in a narrower range, from $1.5$ to $3.5$ rad s$^{-1}$. We show that the $1.3$ kHz signal originates from the high-density inner core of the PNS, and the $m=1$ deformation triggers a strong asymmetric distribution of electron anti-neutrinos. In addition to the $300$ Hz and $1.3$ kHz features, we also observe one weaker but noticeable gravitational-wave feature from higher-order modes in the range between $1.5$ and $3.5$ rad s$^{-1}$. Its peak frequency is around $800$ Hz initially and gradually increases to $900-1000$ Hz. Therefore, in addition to the gravitational bounce signal, the detection of the $300$ Hz, $1.3$ kHz, the higher-order mode, and even the related asymmetric emission of neutrinos, could provide additional diagnostics to estimate the initial angular velocity of a collapsing core.</p>

<p>2023-10-31, <strong>Large extra dimensions from higher-dimensional inflation</strong>, Luis A. Anchordoqui et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20282v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.20282v1</a></p>

<p>We propose the possibility that compact extra dimensions can obtain large size by higher dimensional inflation, relating the weakness of the actual gravitational force to the size of the observable universe. Solution to the horizon problem implies that the fundamental scale of gravity is smaller than $10^{13}$ GeV which can be realised in a braneworld framework for any number of extra dimensions. However, requirement of (approximate) flat power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations consistent with present observations makes this simple proposal possible only for one extra dimension at around the micron scale. After the end of five-dimensional inflation, the radion modulus can be stabilised at a vacuum with positive energy of the order of the present dark energy scale. An attractive possibility is based on the contribution to the Casimir energy of right-handed neutrinos with a mass at a similar scale.</p>

<p>2023-11-01, <strong>DEIMOS spectroscopy of protocluster candidate DEIMOS spectroscopy of $z=6$ protocluster candidate in COSMOS – A massive protocluster embedded in a large scale structure?</strong>, Malte Brinch et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00511v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.00511v1</a></p>

<p>We present the results of our Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic follow-up of candidate galaxies of i-band-dropout protocluster candidate galaxies at $z\sim6$ in the COSMOS field. We securely detect Lyman-$\alpha$ emission lines in 14 of the 30 objects targeted, 10 of them being at $z=6$ with a signal-to-noise ratio of $5-20$, the remaining galaxies are either non-detections or interlopers with redshift too different from $z=6$ to be part of the protocluster. The 10 galaxies at $z\approx6$ make the protocluster one of the riches at $z&gt;5$. The emission lines exhibit asymmetric profiles with high skewness values ranging from 2.87 to 31.75, with a median of 7.37. This asymmetry is consistent with them being Ly$\alpha$, resulting in a redshift range of $z=5.85-6.08$. Using the spectroscopic redshifts, we re-calculate the overdensity map for the COSMOS field and find the galaxies to be in a significant overdensity at the $4\sigma$ level, with a peak overdensity of $\delta=11.8$ (compared to the previous value of $\delta=9.2$). The protocluster galaxies have stellar masses derived from Bagpipes SED fits of $10^{8.29}-10^{10.28} \rm \,M_{\rm \odot}$ and star formation rates of $2-39\,\rm M_{\rm \odot}\rm\,yr^{-1}$, placing them on the main sequence at this epoch. Using a stellar-to-halo-mass relationship, we estimate the dark matter halo mass of the most massive halo in the protocluster to be $\sim 10^{12}\rm M_{\rm \odot}$. By comparison with halo mass evolution tracks from simulations, the protocluster is expected to evolve into a Virgo- or Coma-like cluster in the present day.</p>

<p>2023-11-01, <strong>Constraining the General Oscillatory Inflaton Potential with Freeze-in Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves</strong>, Jose A. R. Cembranos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00378v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.00378v1</a></p>

<p>The reheating phase after inflation is one of the least observationally constrained epochs in the evolution of the Universe. The forthcoming gravitational wave observatories will enable us to constrain at least some of the non-standard scenarios. For example, if the radiation bath is produced via the perturbative inflaton decay that oscillates around a flat minimum of the potential of the form $V\propto\phi^{2n}$, with $n&gt;2$. In such scenarios a part of the inflationary gravitational wave spectrum becomes blue tilted, making it observable, depending on the inflation energy scale and the reheating temperature. The degeneracy between the latter two parameters can be broken if dark matter in the Universe is produced by the freeze-in mechanism. The combination of the independent measurement of dark matter mass with gravitational wave observations makes it possible to constrain the reheating temperature and the energy density at the end of inflation.</p>

<p>2023-11-01, <strong>Gravitational Waves from Preheating in Inflation with Weyl Symmetry</strong>, Wei-Yu Hu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00239v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.00239v1</a></p>

<p>Inflation with Weyl scaling symmetry provides a viable scenario that can generate both the nearly scaling invariant primordial density fluctuation and a dark matter candidate. Here we point out that, in additional to the primordial gravitational waves (GWs) from quantum fluctuations, the production of high-frequency GWs from preheating in such inflation models can provide an another probe of the inflationary dynamics. We conduct both linear analytical analysis and nonlinear numerical lattice simulation in a typical model. We find that significant stochastic GWs can be produced and the frequency band is located around $10^8$ Hz $\sim$ $10^9$ Hz, which might be probed by future resonance-cavity experiments.</p>

<p>2023-11-01, <strong>Pulsar Timing Array Signature from Oscillating Metric Perturbations due to Ultra-light Axion</strong>, Jai-chan Hwang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00234v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.00234v1</a></p>

<p>A coherently oscillating ultra-light axion can behave as dark matter. In particular, its coherently oscillating pressure perturbations can source an oscillating scalar metric perturbation, with a characteristic oscillation frequency which is twice the axion Compton frequency. A candidate in the mass range $10^{(-24,-21)}{\rm eV}$ can provide a signal in the frequency range tested by current and future Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) programs. Involving the pressure perturbations in a highly nonlinear environment, such an analysis demands a relativistic and nonlinear treatment. Here, we provide a rigorous derivation of the effect assuming weak gravity and slow-motion limit of Einstein’s gravity in zero-shear gauge and show that dark matter’s velocity potential determines the oscillation phase and frequency change. A monochromatic PTA signal correlated with the velocity field would confirm the prediction, for example, by cross-correlating the PTA results with the future local velocity flow measurements.</p>

<p>2023-10-31, <strong>LATIS: Constraints on the Galaxy-halo Connection at $z \sim 2.5$ from Galaxy-galaxy and Galaxy-Ly$α$ Clustering</strong>, Andrew B. Newman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00184v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.00184v1</a></p>

<p>The connection between galaxies and dark matter halos is often quantified using the stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation. Optical and near-infrared imaging surveys have led to a broadly consistent picture of the evolving SMHM relation based on measurements of galaxy abundances and angular correlation functions. Spectroscopic surveys at $z \gtrsim 2$ can also constrain the SMHM relation via the galaxy autocorrelation function and through the cross-correlation between galaxies and Ly$\alpha$ absorption measured in transverse sightlines; however, such studies are very few and have produced some unexpected or inconclusive results. We use $\sim$3000 spectra of $z\sim2.5$ galaxies from the Lyman-alpha Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS) to measure the galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-Ly$\alpha$ correlation functions in four bins of stellar mass spanning $10^{9.2} \lesssim M_* / M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{10.5}$. Parallel analyses of the MultiDark N-body and ASTRID hydrodynamic cosmological simulations allow us to model the correlation functions, estimate covariance matrices, and infer halo masses. We find that results of the two methods are mutually consistent and are broadly in accord with standard SMHM relations. This consistency demonstrates that we are able to accurately measure and model Ly$\alpha$ transmission fluctuations $\delta_F$ in LATIS. We also show that the galaxy-Ly$\alpha$ cross-correlation, a free byproduct of optical spectroscopic galaxy surveys at these redshifts, can constrain halo masses with similar precision to galaxy-galaxy clustering.</p>

<p>This paper investigates a hypothesis proposed in previous research relating neutron star (NS) mass and its dark matter (DM) accumulation. As DM accumulates, NS mass decreases, predicting lower NS masses toward the Galactic center. Due to limited NSs data near the galactic center, we examine NSs located within DM clumps. Using the CLUMPY code simulations, we determine the DM clumps distribution, with masses from 10 to $10^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$ and scales from $10^{-3}$ to 10 kpc. These clumps’ DM exhibit a peak at the center, tapering toward the outskirts, resembling our Galaxy’s DM distribution.   We analyse these DM clumps’ NS mass variations, considering diverse DM particle masses and galaxy types. We find relatively stable NS mass within 0.01 to 5 kpc from the clump center. This stability supports the initial hypothesis, particularly for NSs located beyond 0.01 kpc from the clump center, where NS mass reaches a plateau around 0.1 kpc. Nevertheless, NS mass near the clump’s periphery reveals spatial dependence: NS position within DM clumps influences its mass in Milky Way-type galaxies. Moreover, this dependence varies with the DM model considered.   In summary, our study investigates the proposed link between NS mass and DM accumulation by examining NSs within DM clumps. While NS mass remains stable at certain distances from the clump center, spatial dependencies arise near the clump’s outer regions, contingent on the specific DM model.</p>

<p>If the dark matter in the Universe is made of $\mu$eV axion-like particles (ALPs), then a rich phenomenology can emerge in connection to their stimulated decay into two photons. We discuss the ALP stimulated decay induced by astrophysical beams of Galactic radio sources. Three signatures, made by two echoes and one collinear emission, are associated with the decay, and can be simultaneously detected, offering a unique opportunity for a clear ALP identification. We derive the formalism associated with such signatures starting from first principles, and providing the relevant equations to be applied to study the ALP phenomenology. We then focus on the case of Galactic pulsars as stimulating sources and derive forecasts for future observations.</p>

<p>2023-10-31, <strong>How does the presence of bar affects the fueling of supermassive black holes ? An IllustrisTNG100 perspective</strong>, Sandeep Kumar Kataria et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00040v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.00040v1</a></p>

<p>We conduct a statistical study of black hole masses of barred and unbarred galaxies in the IllustrisTNG100 cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. This work aims to understand the role of the bars in the growth of central supermassive black hole mass and its implications on AGN fueling. Our sample consists of 1191 barred galaxies and 2738 unbarred galaxies in the IllustrisTNG100 simulations. To have an unbiased study, we perform our analysis with an equal number of barred and unbarred galaxies by using various controlled parameters like total galaxy mass, stellar mass, gas mass, dark matter halo mass, etc. Except for the stellar mass controlling, we find that the median of the black hole mass distribution for barred galaxies is higher than that of the unbarred ones indicating that stellar mass is a key parameter influencing the black hole growth. The higher mean accretion rate of the black holes in barred galaxies, averaged since the bar forming epoch (z~2 ), explains the higher mean black hole masses in barred galaxies. Further, we also test that these results are unaffected by other environmental processes like minor/major merger histories and neighboring gas density of black hole. Although the relationship between stellar mass, bar formation, and black hole growth is complex, with various mechanisms involved, our analysis suggests that bars can play a crucial role in feeding black holes, particularly in galaxies with massive stellar disks.</p>

<p>Thermal relic dark matter below $\sim 10 \ \text{GeV}$ is excluded by cosmic microwave background data if its annihilation to visible particles is unsuppressed near the epoch of recombination. Usual model-building measures to avoid this bound involve kinematically suppressing the annihilation rate in the low-velocity limit, thereby yielding dim prospects for indirect detection signatures at late times. In this work, we investigate a class of cosmologically-viable sub-GeV thermal relics with late-time annihilation rates that are detectable with existing and proposed telescopes across a wide range of parameter space. We study a representative model of inelastic dark matter featuring a stable state $\chi_1$ and a slightly heavier excited state $\chi_2$ whose abundance is thermally depleted before recombination. Since the kinetic energy of dark matter in the Milky Way is much larger than it is during recombination, $\chi_1 \chi_1 \to \chi_2 \chi_2$ upscattering can efficiently regenerate a cosmologically long-lived Galactic population of $\chi_2$, whose subsequent coannihilations with $\chi_1$ give rise to observable gamma-rays in the $\sim 1 \ \text{MeV} - 100 \ \text{MeV}$ energy range. We find that proposed MeV gamma-ray telescopes, such as e-ASTROGAM, AMEGO, and MAST, would be sensitive to much of the thermal relic parameter space in this class of models and thereby enable both discovery and model discrimination in the event of a signal at accelerator or direct detection experiments.</p>

<p>We develop a model independent, robust method for determining galaxy rotation velocities across a 2D array of spaxels from an integral field spectrograph. Simulations demonstrate the method is accurate down to lower spectral signal-to-noise than standard methods: 99\% accurate when median $S/N=4$. We apply it to MaNGA data to construct the galaxy velocity map and galaxy rotation curve. We also develop a highly efficient cubic smoothing approach that is $25\times$ faster computationally and only slightly less accurate. Such model independent methods could be useful in studying dark matter properties without assuming a galaxy model.</p>

<p>2023-10-31, <strong>Evaluating the reconstruction of individual haloes in constrained cosmological simulations</strong>, Richard Stiskalek et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20672v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.20672v1</a></p>

<p>Constrained cosmological simulations play an important role in modelling the local Universe, enabling investigation of the dark matter content of local structures and their formation histories. We introduce a method for determining the extent to which individual haloes are reliably reconstructed between constrained simulations, and apply it to the Constrained Simulations in BORG (CSiBORG) suite of $101$ high-resolution realisations across the posterior probability distribution of initial conditions from the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm. The method is based on the overlap of the initial Lagrangian patch of a halo in one simulation with those in another, and therefore measures the degree to which the haloes’ particles are initially coincident. By this metric we find consistent reconstructions of $M\gtrsim10^{14}~M_\odot / h$ haloes across the CSiBORG simulations, indicating that the constraints from the BORG algorithm are sufficient to pin down the masses, positions and peculiar velocities of clusters to high precision. The effect of the constraints tapers off towards lower mass however, and the halo spins and concentrations are largely unconstrained at all masses. We document the advantages of evaluating halo consistency in the initial conditions, describe how the method may be used to quantify our knowledge of the halo field given galaxy survey data analysed through the lens of probabilistic inference machines such as BORG, and describe applications to matched but unconstrained simulations.</p>

<p>Future e$^+$e$^-$ colliders, thanks to their clean environment and triggerless operation, offer a unique opportunity to search for long-lived particles (LLPs). Considered in this contribution are promising prospects for LLP searches offered by the International Large Detector (ILD), with a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) as the core of its tracking systems, providing almost continuous tracking. The ILD has been developed as a detector concept for the ILC, however, studies on understanding of the ILD performance at other collider concepts are ongoing. Based on the full detector simulation, we study the possibility of reconstructing decays of both light and heavy LLPs at the ILD. For the heavy, $\mathcal{O}$(100 GeV) LLPs, we consider a challenging scenario with small mass splitting between the LLP and the dark matter candidate, resulting in only a very soft displaced track pair in the final state, not pointing to the interaction point. We account for the soft beam-induced background (from measurable e$^+$e$^-$ pairs and hadron photo-production processes), expected to give the dominant background contribution due to a very high cross section, and show the possible means of its reduction. As the opposite extreme scenario we consider the production of a light, $\mathcal{O}$(1 GeV) pseudo-scalar LLP, which decays to two highly boosted and almost colinear displaced tracks. We also present the corresponding results for an alternative ILD design, where the TPC is replaced by a silicon tracker modified from the Compact Linear Collider detector (CLICdet) design.</p>

<p>2023-10-31, <strong>Kinetic recoupling of dark matter</strong>, Benjamin V. Lehmann et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20513v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.20513v1</a></p>

<p>We study the possibility that dark matter re-enters kinetic equilibrium with a radiation bath after kinetic decoupling, a scenario we dub kinetic recoupling. This naturally occurs, for instance, with certain types of resonantly-enhanced interactions, or as the result of a phase transition. While late kinetic decoupling damps structure on small scales below a cutoff, kinetic recoupling produces more complex changes in the power spectrum that depend on the nature and extent of the recoupling period. We explore the features that kinetic recoupling imprints upon the matter power spectrum, and discuss how such features can be traced to dark matter microphysics with future observations.</p>

<p>The nature of the dark matter in the Universe is one of the hardest unsolved problems in modern physics. Indeed, on one hand, the overwhelming indirect evidence from astrophysics seems to leave no doubt about its existence; on the other hand, direct search experiments, especially those conducted with low background detectors in underground laboratories all over the world seem to deliver only null results, with a few debated exceptions. Furthermore, the lack of predicted candidates at the LHC energy scale has made this dichotomy even more puzzling. We will recall the most important phases of this novel branch of experimental astro-particle physics, analyzing the interconnections among the main projects involved in this challenging quest, and we will draw conclusions slightly different from how the problem is commonly understood.</p>

<p>The axion is a long-postulated boson that can simultaneously solve two fundamental problems of modern physics: the charge-parity symmetry problem in the strong interaction and the enigma of dark matter. In this work we estimate, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, the sensitivity of the Dark-photons$\&amp;$Axion-Like particles Interferometer (DALI), a new-generation Fabry-P'erot haloscope proposed to probe axion dark matter in the 25-250 $\mu$eV band.</p>

<p>The cosmological evolution within the framework of exponential $F(R)$ gravity is analysed by assuming two forms for dark matter: (a) a standard dust-like fluid and (b) an axion scalar field. As shown in previous literature, an axion-like field oscillates during the cosmological evolution but can play the role of dark matter when approaching the minimum of its potential. Both scenarios are confronted with recent observational data including the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae, Hubble parameter estimations (Cosmic Chronometers), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Cosmic Microwave Background distances. The models show great possibilities in describing these observations when compared with the $\Lambda$CDM model, supporting the viability of exponential $F(R)$ gravity. The differences between both descriptions of dark matter is analysed.</p>

<p>2023-10-31, <strong>How do baryonic effects on the cosmic matter distribution vary with scale and local density environment?</strong>, Yun Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20278v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.20278v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, we investigate how the baryonic effects vary with scale and local density environment mainly by utilizing a novel statistic, the environment-dependent wavelet power spectrum (env-WPS). With four state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suites, EAGLE, SIMBA, Illustris, and IllustrisTNG, we compare the env-WPS of the total matter density field between the hydrodynamic and dark matter-only (DMO) runs at $z=0$. We find that the clustering is most strongly suppressed in the emptiest environment of $\rho_\mathrm{m}/\bar\rho_\mathrm{m}&lt;0.1$ with maximum amplitudes $\sim67-89$ per cent on scales $\sim1.86-10.96\ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and less suppressed in higher density environments on small scales (except Illustris). In the environments of $\rho_\mathrm{m}/\bar\rho_\mathrm{m}\geqslant0.316$ ($\geqslant10$ in EAGLE), the feedbacks also lead to enhancement features at intermediate and large scales, which is most pronounced in the densest environment of $\rho_\mathrm{m}/\bar\rho_\mathrm{m}\geqslant100$ and reaches a maximum $\sim 7-15$ per cent on scales $\sim0.87-2.62\ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ (except Illustris). The baryon fraction of the local environment decreases with increasing density, denoting the feedback strength, and potentially explaining some differences between simulations. We also measure the volume and mass fractions of local environments, which are affected by $\gtrsim 1$ per cent due to baryon physics. In conclusion, our results reveal that the baryonic processes can change the overall cosmic structure greatly over the scales of $k&gt;0.1\ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. These findings warrant further investigation and confirmation by using much larger or more numerous simulations, comparing different cosmic structure classifications, or altering a specific process in the simulation, e.g. the star formation, black hole accretion, stellar feedback or active galactic nucleus feedback.</p>

<p>2023-10-31, <strong>Beyond Best-Fits and Model Selection – Introducing “Reliability” of cusp-core inference of dark matter halos</strong>, Manush Manju et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20272v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.20272v1</a></p>

<p>We introduce the notion of a Bayesian analysis motivated `reliability’ that gives a truer distinction of cusp-core and other halo-parameters (like mass-concentration) in an ensemble of observed galaxies. Our approach goes beyond the standard statistical techniques of parameter estimation and model fitting. We create hundreds of thousands of realistic mock SPARC RCs, with both cuspy and cored DM density profiles as model inputs. These RCs carefully incorporate the details of SPARC data such as the nature of observed uncertainties and different sources of scatters arising from observation, presence of baryons, DM mass-concentration, etc. Bayesian analysis of these mock RCs enables us to reconstruct and identify the parameter space in galaxy observable and theory where one can venture beyond best-fits to a preferred DM halo model or model selections between different density models. We find that it is imperative to choose low stellar surface density ($\Sigma_{\star}$) galaxies for reliable cusp-vs-core distinction; for example, RC data for galaxies with $\Sigma_{\star} \leq 2.5$ is needed for a 75\% confidence in distinguishing cusps from cores. Similarly, we also find that for correct estimations of the halo masses and concentrations, the RCs need to be measured to at least a radial distance $\geq 0.8r_s$ where $r_s$ is the scale radii of the corresponding DM halo density profiles. Out of the total $\sim$ 135 SPARC galaxies, using our reliability criteria, we find that only 21 RCs clear the bar to be used for any unbiased cusp-core distinction as well as DM halo mass-concentration estimates at $\geq$75\% reliability confidence level. With $\geq$66\% ( $\geq$50\%) reliability settings, the sample size increases to 44 (59). Interestingly, in the $\geq 75$\% reliable subsample, there are 5 times more galaxies that are reliably cored than cuspy. [Abridged]</p>

<p>Be X-ray binaries (Be XRBs) are high-mass X-ray binaries, with a neutron star or black hole orbiting and accreting material from a non-supergiant B-star that is rotating at a near critical rate. These objects are prime targets to understand past binary interactions as the neutron star or black hole progenitor likely experienced Roche lobe overflow to spin up the Be star we observe now. The stellar variability can then allow us to explore the stellar structure of these objects. It was recently demonstrated that the high-mass X-ray binary CPD -29 2176 descended from an ultra-stripped supernova and is a prime target to evolve into an eventual binary neutron star and kilonova. We present the photometric variability from both TESS and ASAS along with the spectral properties and disk variability of the system in this paper. All of the optical lines are contaminated with disk emission except for the He II $\lambda$4686 absorption line. The disk variability time-scales are not the same as the orbital time scale, but could be related to the X-ray outbursts that have been recorded by Swift. We end our study with a discussion comparing CPD -29 2176 to classical Be stars and other Be X-ray binaries, finding the stellar rotation to be near a frequency of 1.5 cycles d$^{-1}$, and exhibiting incoherent variability in three frequency groups.</p>

<p>2023-11-01, <strong>An effective description of Laniakea and its backreaction: Impact on Cosmology and the local determination of the Hubble constant</strong>, L. Giani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00215v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.00215v1</a></p>

<p>We propose an effective model to describe the backreaction on cosmological observables induced by Laniakea, the gravitational supercluster hosting the Milky Way, which was defined using peculiar velocity data from Cosmicflows-4 (CF4). The structure is well described by an ellipsoidal shape exhibiting triaxial expansion, reasonably approximated by a constant expansion rate along the principal axes. Our best fits suggest that the ellipsoid, after subtracting the background expansion, contracts along the two smaller axes and expands along the longest one, predicting an average expansion of $\sim -1.1 ~\rm{km}/\rm{s}/\rm{Mpc}$. The different expansion rates within the region, relative to the mean cosmological expansion, induce line-of-sight-dependent corrections in the computation of luminosity distances. We apply these corrections to two low-redshift datasets: the Pantheon+ catalog of type Ia Supernovae (SN~Ia), and 63 measurements of Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF) of early-type massive galaxies from the MASSIVE survey. We find corrections on the distances of order $\sim 2-3\%$, resulting in a shift in the inferred best-fit values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ of order $\Delta H_0^{\rm{SN~Ia}}\approx 0.5 ~\rm{km}/\rm{s}/\rm{Mpc}$ and $\Delta H_0^{\rm{SBF}}\approx 1.1 ~\rm{km}/\rm{s}/\rm{Mpc}$, seemingly worsening the Hubble tension.</p>

Mollá et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00076v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.00076v1</a></p>

<p>The role of type Ia supernovae, mainly the Delay Time Distributions (DTDs) determined by the binary systems, and the yields of elements created by different explosion mechanisms, are studied by using the {\sc MulChem} chemical evolution model, applied to our Galaxy. We explored 15 DTDs, and 12 tables of elemental yields produced by different SN Ia explosion mechanisms, doing a total of 180 models. Chemical abundances for $\alpha$-elements (O, Mg, Si, S, Ca) and Fe derived from these models, are compared with recent observational data of $\alpha$-elements over Iron relative abundances, [X/Fe]. These data have been compiled and binned in 13 datasets. By using a $\chi^2$-technique, no model is able to fit simultaneously these datasets. A model computed with the 13 individual best models is good enough to reproduce them. Thus, a power law with a logarithmic slope $\sim -1.1$ and a delay in the range $\Delta \tau=40 –350$ Myr is a possible DTD, but a combination of several channels is more probable. Results of this average model for other disc regions show a high dispersion, as observed, which might be explained by the stellar migration. The dispersion might also come from a combination of DTDs or of explosion channels. The stellar migration joined to a combination of scenarios for SNIa is the probable cause of the observed dispersion.</p>

<p>2023-10-31, <strong>Realistic simulated galaxies form [$α$/Fe]-[Fe/H] knees due to a sustained decline in their star formation rates</strong>, Andrew C. Mason et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00041v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.00041v1</a></p>

<p>We examine the stellar [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution of $\simeq1000$ present-day galaxies in a high-resolution EAGLE simulation. A slight majority of galaxies exhibit the canonical distribution, characterised by a sequence of low-metallicity stars with high [$\alpha$/Fe] that transitions at a “knee” to a sequence of declining [$\alpha$/Fe] with increasing metallicity. This population yields a knee metallicity - galaxy-mass relation similar to that observed in Local Group galaxies, both in slope and scatter. However, many simulated galaxies lack a knee or exhibit more complicated distributions. Knees are found only in galaxies with star formation histories (SFHs) featuring a sustained decline from an early peak ($t\simeq7~{\rm Gyr}$), which enables enrichment by Type Ia supernovae to dominate that due to Type II supernovae (SN II), reducing [$\alpha$/Fe] in the interstellar gas. The simulation thus indicates that, contrary to the common interpretation implied by analytic galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models, knee formation is not a consequence of the onset of enrichment by SN Ia. We use the SFH of a simulated galaxy exhibiting a knee as input to the VICE GCE model, finding it yields an $\alpha$-rich plateau enriched only by SN II, but the plateau comprises little stellar mass and the galaxy forms few metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\lesssim - 1$) stars. This follows from the short, constant gas consumption timescale typically assumed by GCEs, which implies the presence of a readily-enriched, low-mass gas reservoir. When an initially longer, evolving consumption timescale is adopted, VICE reproduces the simulated galaxy’s track through the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane and its metallicity distribution function.</p>

<p>Supernova explosions attributed to the unseen companion in several binary systems identified by the Third Gaia Data Release (Gaia DR3) may be responsible for a number of well-known and well-studied features in the radio sky, including the Low-Latitude-Intermediate-Velocity Arch and the North-Celestial-Pole Loop. Slices from the Longitude-Latitude-Velocity data cube of the $\lambda$-21-cm galactic neutral hydrogen HI4PI survey (HI4PI Collaboration et al. 2016) show multiple signatures of an expanding shell. The source of this expansion, which includes the Low-Latitude-Intermediate-Velocity Arch on the approaching side, may be the neutron star candidate in the Gaia DR3 1093757200530267520 binary. If we make the simplifying assumptions that the expansion of the cavity is uniform and spherically symmetric, then the explosion took place about 700,000 years ago. The momentum is in reasonable agreement with recent model estimates for a supernova this old. The HI on the receding side of this cavity is interacting with the gas approaching us on the near side of a second cavity. The North-Celestial-Pole Loop appears to be located at the intersection of these two expanding features. The neutron star candidate in the Gaia DR3 1144019690966028928 binary may be (in part) responsible for this cavity. Explosions from other candidates may account for the observed elongation along the line of sight of this second cavity. We can use the primary star in these binaries to anchor the distances to the Low-Latitude-Intermediate-Velocity Arch and North-Celestial-Pole Loop, which are about 167 and about 220 pc, respectively.</p>

<p>$Aims:$ We used the nearby Coma Cluster as a laboratory in order to probe the impact of ram pressure on star formation as well as to constrain the characteristic timescales and velocities for the stripping of the non-thermal ISM. $Methods:$ We used high-resolution ($6.5’’ \approx 3\,\mathrm{kpc}$), multi-frequency ($144\,\mathrm{MHz} - 1.5\,\mathrm{GHz}$) radio continuum imaging of the Coma Cluster to resolve the low-frequency radio spectrum across the discs and tails of 25 ram pressure stripped galaxies. With resolved spectral index maps across these galaxy discs, we constrained the impact of ram pressure perturbations on galaxy star formation. We measured multi-frequency flux-density profiles along each of the ram pressure stripped tails in our sample. We then fit the resulting radio continuum spectra with a simple synchrotron aging model. $Results:$ We showed that ram pressure stripped tails in Coma have steep ($-2 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -1$) spectral indices. The discs of galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping have integrated spectral indices within the expected range for shock acceleration from supernovae ($-0.8 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -0.5$), though there is a tail towards flatter values. In a resolved sense, there are gradients in spectral index across the discs of ram pressure stripped galaxies in Coma. These gradients are aligned with the direction of the observed radio tails, with the flattest spectral indices being found on the `leading half’. From best-fit break frequencies we estimated the projected plasma velocities along the tail to be on the order of hundreds of kilometers per second, with the precise magnitude depending on the assumed magnetic field strength.</p>

<p>We present a pan-chromatic study of AT2017bcc, a nuclear transient that was discovered in 2017 within the skymap of a reported burst-like gravitational wave candidate, G274296. It was initially classified as a superluminous supernova, and then reclassified as a candidate tidal disruption event. Its optical light curve has since shown ongoing variability with a structure function consistent with that of an active galactic nucleus, however earlier data shows no variability for at least 10 years prior to the outburst in 2017. The spectrum shows complex profiles in the broad Balmer lines: a central component with a broad blue wing, and a boxy component with time-variable blue and red shoulders. The H$\alpha$ emission profile is well modelled using a circular accretion disc component, and a blue-shifted double Gaussian which may indicate a partially obscured outflow. Weak narrow lines, together with the previously flat light curve, suggest that this object represents a dormant galactic nucleus which has recently been re-activated. Our time-series modelling of the Balmer lines suggests that this is connected to a disturbance in the disc morphology, and we speculate this could involve a sudden violent event such as a tidal disruption event involving the central supermassive black hole. Although we find that the redshifts of AT2017bcc ($z=0.13$) and G274296 ($z&gt;0.42$) are inconsistent, this event adds to the growing diversity of both nuclear transients and multi-messenger contaminants.</p>

<p>2023-10-31, <strong>Square-Root parametrization of dark energy in $f(Q)$ cosmology</strong>, M. Koussour et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20405v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.20405v1</a></p>

<p>This paper is a parametrization of the equation of state (EoS) parameter of dark energy (DE), which is parameterized using Square-Root (SR) form i.e. $\omega _{SR}=\text{$\omega _{0}$}+\text{$\omega _{1}$}\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^{2}+1}}$, where $\omega _{0}$ and $\omega _{1}$ are free constants. This parametrization will be examined in the context of the recently suggested $f(Q)$ gravity theory as an alternative to General Relativity (GR), in which gravitational effects are attributed to the non-metricity scalar $Q$ with the functional form $f(Q)=Q+\alpha Q^{n}$, where $\alpha$ and $n$ are arbitrary constants. We derived observational constraints on model parameters using the Hubble dataset with 31 data points and the Supernovae (SNe) dataset from the Pantheon samples compilation dataset with 1048 data points. For the current model, the evolution of the deceleration parameter, density parameter, EoS for DE, and $Om(z)$ diagnostic have all been investigated. It has been shown that the deceleration parameter favors the current accelerated expansion phase. It has also been shown that the EoS parameter for DE has a quintessence nature at this time.</p>

<p>2023-10-31, <strong>Exponential F(R) gravity with axion dark matter</strong>, Sergei D. Odintsov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20302v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.20302v1</a></p>

<p>The cosmological evolution within the framework of exponential $F(R)$ gravity is analysed by assuming two forms for dark matter: (a) a standard dust-like fluid and (b) an axion scalar field. As shown in previous literature, an axion-like field oscillates during the cosmological evolution but can play the role of dark matter when approaching the minimum of its potential. Both scenarios are confronted with recent observational data including the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae, Hubble parameter estimations (Cosmic Chronometers), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Cosmic Microwave Background distances. The models show great possibilities in describing these observations when compared with the $\Lambda$CDM model, supporting the viability of exponential $F(R)$ gravity. The differences between both descriptions of dark matter is analysed.</p>
