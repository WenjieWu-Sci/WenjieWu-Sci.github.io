<p>2024-02-07, <strong>Characterization and Optimization of Cryogenic Pure CsI Detector for CLOVERS Experiment</strong>, Chenguang Su et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05026v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.05026v2</a></p>

<p>In this study, we conducted a comprehensive characterization and optimization of a cryogenic pure CsI (pCsI) detector. Achieving a notable light yield of \SI{35.2}{PE/\keV_{ee}} and a world-leading energy resolution of \SI{6.9}{\%} at \SI{60}{\keV}, we utilized a \SI{2}{\centi\metre} cubic crystal coupled with a HAMAMATSU R11065 photomultiplier tube (PMT). Additionally, we measured the scintillation decay time of pCsI, which proved to be significantly faster than that of CsI(Na) at room temperature. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of temperature, surface treatment, and crystal shape on the light yield. Notably, the light yield peaked at approximately \SI{20}{\K} and remained stable within the range of \SI{70}-\SI{100}{\K}. We observed that the light yield of polished crystals was approximately 1.5 times greater than that of ground crystals, while the crystal shape exhibited minimal influence on the light yield. These results are crucial for the design of the \SI{12}{\kg} pCsI detector for the future CLOVERS (Coherent eLastic neutrinO(V)-nucleus scattERing at China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS)) experiment.</p>

<p>2024-02-07, <strong>Once-in-a-lifetime encounter models for neutrino media: From coherent oscillation to flavor equilibration</strong>, Anson Kost et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05022v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.05022v1</a></p>

<p>Collective neutrino oscillations are typically studied using the lowest-order quantum kinetic equation, also known as the mean-field approximation. However, some recent quantum many-body simulations suggest that quantum entanglement among neutrinos may be important and may result in flavor equilibration of the neutrino gas. In this work, we develop new quantum many-body models for neutrino gases in which any pair of neutrinos can interact at most once in their lifetimes. A key parameter of our models is $\gamma=\mu \Delta z$, where $\mu$ is the neutrino coupling strength, which is proportional to the neutrino density, and $\Delta z$ is the duration over which a pair of neutrinos can interact each time. Our models reduce to the mean-field approach in the limit $\gamma\to0$ and achieve flavor equilibration in time $t \gg (\gamma\mu)^{-1}$. These models demonstrate the emergence of coherent flavor oscillations from the particle perspective and may help elucidate the role of quantum entanglement in collective neutrino oscillations.</p>

<p>2024-02-07, <strong>Floor of cosmogenic neutrino fluxes above $10^{17}~$eV</strong>, Corinne Berat et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04759v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.04759v1</a></p>

<p>The search for neutrinos with energies greater than $10^{17}~$eV is being actively pursued. Although normalization of the dominant neutrino flux is highly uncertain, a floor level is guaranteed by the interactions of extragalactic cosmic rays with Milky Way gas. We estimate that this floor level gives an energy flux of $E^2\phi_\nu\simeq 10^{-13^{+0.5}_{-0.5}}~$GeV~cm$^{-2}$~sr$^{-1}$~s$^{-1}$ at $10^{18}~$eV, where uncertainties arise from the modeling of the gas distribution and the experimental determination of the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays on Earth. Based on a minimal model of cosmic-ray production to explain the mass-discriminated energy spectra observed on Earth above $5{\times}10^{18}$~eV, we also present generic estimates of the neutrino fluxes expected from extragalactic production that generally exceed the aforementioned guaranteed floor. The prospects for detecting neutrinos above $10^{18}$~eV remain however challenging, unless proton acceleration to the highest energies is at play in a sub-dominant population of cosmic-ray sources or new physical phenomena are at work.</p>

<p>2024-02-07, <strong>Temperature evolution in the Early Universe and freeze-in at stronger coupling</strong>, Catarina Cosme et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04743v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.04743v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter freeze-in at stronger coupling is operative when the Standard Model (SM) bath temperature never exceeds the dark matter mass. An attractive feature of this scenario is that it can be probed by direct detection experiments as well as at the LHC. In this work, we show how the mechanism can be realized in a simple UV complete framework, emphasizing the role of the maximal temperature of the SM thermal bath. We demonstrate that the maximal temperature can coincide with the reheating temperature or be close to it such that dark matter production is always Boltzmann-suppressed. This possibility is realized, for example, if the inflaton decays primarily into feebly interacting right-handed neutrinos, which subsequently generate the SM thermal bath. In this case, the SM sector temperature remains constant over cosmological times prior to reheating.</p>

<p>2024-02-07, <strong>Systematic local simulations of fast neutrino flavor conversions with scattering effects</strong>, Milad Delfan Azari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04741v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.04741v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the dynamics of fast neutrino flavor conversions (FFCs) in the one-dimensional (1D) inhomogeneous and the homogeneous models as post processes by employing snapshots obtained by our self-consistent, realistic Boltzmann simulations in two spatial dimensions (2D). We show that the FFC growth rate is considerably larger in the inhomogeneous model than in the homogeneous model, as expected from the previous linear analysis results. We find that the momentum space dimension does not significantly influence the neutrino transition probability under inhomogeneous conditions. On the other hand, in the homogeneous model without collisions, the FFC depends on the momentum space, and the azimuthal angle dependence breaks the periodicity of the FFC. Our study demonstrates that collision-induced enhancement occurs on a long time scale in the inhomogeneous model. Despite that collision-induced enhancement does not appear on the short time scale, that should be taken into account to predict the final conversion probability.</p>

<p>2024-02-07, <strong>Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay in Multiple Isotopes for Fingerprints Identification of Operators and Models</strong>, Shao-Long Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04600v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.04600v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay is the most promising way to determine whether neutrinos are Majorana particles. There are many experiments based on different isotopes searching for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. The Majorana neutrino mass models come in a wide variety, and it is significant to distinguish these models. Combining the searches of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in multiple isotopes provides a possible method to distinguish different models. The contributions to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay come from standard, long-range, and short-range mechanisms. We analyze the scenario in which the standard and short-range mechanisms exist simultaneously and consider specific neutrino mass models that can contribute to neutrinoless double beta decay via multiple mechanisms. We conclude that the complementary searches for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in different isotopes can effectively examine the parameter regions and distinguish certain low-energy effective operators and models.</p>

<p>2024-02-07, <strong>Distinguish dark matter theories with the cosmic web and next-generation surveys I: an alternative theory of gravity</strong>, Pierre Boldrini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04837v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.04837v1</a></p>

<p>In the context of future large surveys like the Euclid mission, extracting the cosmic web from galaxies at higher redshifts with more statistical power will become feasible, particularly within the group-cluster mass regime. Therefore, it is imperative to enlarge the number of metrics that can used to constrain our cosmological models at these large scales. The number of cosmic filaments surrounding galaxies, groups and clusters, namely the connectivity, has recently emerged as a compelling probe of the large-scale structures, and has been investigated in various observational and numerical analyses. In this first paper, we examine dark matter-only cosmological simulations using the widely used DisPerSE filament finder code under two theories of gravity: the Poisson ($\Lambda$CDM) and the Monge-Amp`ere models, in order to quantify how alternative models of gravity alter the properties of the cosmic skeleton. We specifically focused on this alternative gravity theory due to its propensity to enhance the formation of anisotropic structures such as filaments, but it also makes them more resistant to collapse, which consequently reduces the formation of halos. Indeed, our findings reveal that replacing the Poisson equation has a significant impact on the hierarchical formation scenario. This is evidenced by examining the redshift evolution of both the slope and the offset of the connectivity. Additionally, we demonstrated that current observations are generally in better agreement with our well-established gravity model. Finally, our study suggests that filament connectivity in the group-cluster regime could serve as a probe of our gravity model at cosmological scales. We also emphasize that our approach could be extended to alternative theories of dark matter, such as warm or fuzzy dark matter, given the extraordinary datasets provided by next-generation surveys.</p>

<p>2024-02-07, <strong>Detecting dark matter oscillations with gravitational waveforms</strong>, Philippe Brax et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04819v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.04819v1</a></p>

<p>We consider the phase shift in the gravitational wave signal induced by fast oscillations of scalar dark matter surrounding binary systems, which could be probed by the future experiments LISA and DECIGO. This effect depends on the local matter density and the mass of the dark matter particle. We compare it to the phase shift due to a standard dynamical friction term, which should generically be present. We find that the effect associated with the oscillations only dominates over the dynamical friction for dark matter masses below $10^{-21}$ eV, with masses below $10^{-23}$ eV implying cloud sizes that are too large to be realistic. Moreover, for masses of the order of $10^{-21}$ eV, LISA and DECIGO would only detect this effect for dark matter densities greater than that in the solar system by a factor $10^5$ or $10^4$ respectively. We conclude that this signal can be ignored for most dark matter scenarios unless very dense clouds of very light dark matter are created early in the Universe at a redshift $z\sim 10^4$.</p>

<p>2024-02-07, <strong>The Galactic center excess at the highest energies: morphology and photon-count statistics</strong>, Silvia Manconi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04733v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.04733v1</a></p>

<p>The nature of the GeV gamma-ray Galactic center excess (GCE) in the data of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) is still to be unveiled. We present a new analysis of the inner Galaxy Fermi-LAT data at energies above 10 GeV, based on an innovative method which combines the skyFACT adaptive template fitting with and the 1pPDF pixel-count statistics. We find a strong evidence for the GCE also at high energies, $\sigma &gt; 5$ regardless of the GCE spatial template. Remarkably, our fits prefer the bulge morphological model over the dark matter one at high significance, and show no evidence for an additional dark matter template on top of the bulge component. Through the 1pPDF analysis, we find that the model best describing the gamma-ray data requires a smooth, diffuse GCE following a bulge morphology, together with sub-threshold point sources. The 1pPDF fit reconstructs a consistent population of faint point sources down at least to $10^{-12}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Between $10^{-12}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and $10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ the 1pPDF measures a number of point sources significantly higher than the ones in the Fermi 4FGL catalog. The robustness of our results brings further support to the attempt of explaining, at least partially, the high-energy tail of the GCE in terms of a population of point sources, likely corresponding to millisecond pulsars.</p>

<p>2024-02-07, <strong>The Bondi-Sachs formalism for the Einstein scalar field equations with the zero cosmological constant</strong>, Jialue Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04577v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.04577v1</a></p>

<p>Inspired by interaction of gravitational waves and dark matters, we study the Bondi-Sachs formalism for Einstein massless scalar field with zero cosmological constant. We provide asymptotic expansions for the Bondi-Sachs metrics as well as the scalar fields and prove the peeling property. We also prove the positivity of the Bondi energy-momentum under conditions ensuring certain asymptotically null hypersurfaces are of order 2.</p>

<p>2024-02-07, <strong>Applying Simulation-Based Inference to Spectral and Spatial Information from the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess</strong>, Katharena Christy et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04549v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.04549v1</a></p>

<p>The two most favored explanations of the Fermi Galactic Center gamma-ray excess (GCE) are millisecond pulsars and self annihilation of the smooth dark matter halo of the galaxy. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we would like to optimally use all information in the available data, including photon direction and energy information. To date, analyses of the GCE have generally treated directional and energy information separately, or have ignored one or the other completely. Here, we develop a method for analyzing the GCE that relies on simulation-based inference with neural posterior models to jointly analyze photon directional and spectral information while correctly accounting for the spatial and energy resolution of the telescope, here assumed to be the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Our results also have implications for analyses of the diffuse gamma-ray background, which we discuss.</p>

<p>2024-02-07, <strong>Nature of the diffuse emission sources in the H I supershell in the galaxy IC 1613</strong>, Anastasiya D. Yarovova et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05107v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.05107v1</a></p>

<p>We present a study of the nearby low-metallicity dwarf galaxy IC 1613, focusing on the search for massive stars and related feedback processes, as well as for faint supernova remnants (SNR) in late stages of evolution. We obtained the deepest images of IC 1613 in the narrow-band H{\alpha}, He II and [S II] emission lines and new long-slit spectroscopy observations using several facilities (6-m BTA, 2.5m SAI MSU, and 150RTT telescopes), in combination with the multi-wavelength archival data from MUSE/VLT, VLA, XMM-Newton, and Swift/XRT. Our deep narrow-band photometry identifies several faint shells in the galaxy, and we further investigate their physical characteristics with the new long-slit spectroscopy observations and the archival multi-wavelength data. Based on energy balance calculations and assumptions about their possible nature, we propose that one of the shells is a possible remnant of a supernova explosion. We study five out of eight Wolf-Rayet (WR) star candidates previously published for this galaxy using the He ii emission line mapping, MUSE/VLT archival spectra, and new long-slit spectra. Our analysis discards the considered WR candidates and finds no new ones. We found P Cyg profiles in H{\alpha} line in two stars, which we classify as Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) star candidates. Overall, the galaxy IC 1613 may have a lower rate of WR star formation than previously suggested.</p>

<p>2024-02-07, <strong>On the Formation of Double Neutron Stars in the Milky Way: Influence of Key Parameters</strong>, Zhu-Ling Deng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04658v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.04658v1</a></p>

<p>The detection of gravitational wave events has stimulated theoretical modeling of the formation and evolution of double compact objects (DCOs). However, even for the most studied isolated binary evolution channel, there exist large uncertainties in the input parameters and treatments of the binary evolution process. So far, double neutron stars (DNSs) are the only DCOs for which direct observations are available through traditional electromagnetic astronomy. In this work, we adopt a population synthesis method to investigate the formation and evolution of Galactic DNSs. We construct 324 models for the formation of Galactic DNSs, taking into account various possible combinations of critical input parameters and processes such as mass transfer efficiency, supernova type, common envelope efficiency, neutron star kick velocity, and pulsar selection effect. We employ Bayesian analysis to evaluate the adopted models by comparing with observations. We also compare the expected DNS merger rate in the Galaxy with that inferred from the known Galactic population of Pulsar-NS systems. Based on these analyses we derive favorable range of the aforementioned key parameters.</p>

<p>2024-02-07, <strong>A Robust Light-Curve Diagnostic for Electron-Capture Supernovae and Low-Mass Fe-Core-Collapse Supernovae</strong>, Masato Sato et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04611v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.04611v1</a></p>

<p>Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are the terminal explosions of massive stars. While most massive stars explode as iron-core-collapse supernovae (FeCCSNe), slightly less massive stars explode as electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe), shaping the low-mass end of CCSNe. ECSNe was proposed $\sim 40$ years ago and first-principles simulations also predict their successful explosions. Observational identification and investigation of ECSNe are important for the completion of stellar evolution theory. To date, only one promising candidate has been proposed, SN 2018zd, other than the historical progenitor of the Crab Nebula, SN 1054. We present representative synthetic light curves of low-mass FeCCSNe and ECSNe exploding with energies in circumstellar media (CSM) estimated with theoretically or observationally plausible methods. The plateaus of the ECSNe are shorter, brighter, and bluer than those of the FeCCSNe. To investigate the robustness of their intrinsic differences, we adopted various explosion energies and CSM. Although they may have similar bolometric light-curve plateaus, ECSNe are bluer than FeCCSNe in the absence of strong CSM interaction, illustrating that multicolor observations are essential to identify ECSNe. This provides a robust indicator of ECSNe because the bluer plateaus stem from the low-density envelopes of their super-asymptotic-giant-branch progenitors. Furthermore, we propose a distance-independent method to identify ECSNe: $(g-r)_{t_{\rm PT}/2} &lt; 0.008 \times t_{\rm PT} - 0.4$, i.e., blue $g-r$ at the middle of the plateau $(g-r)_{t_{\rm PT}/2}$, where $t_{\rm PT}$ is the transition epoch from plateau to tail. Using this method, we identified SN 2018zd as an ECSN, which we believe to be the first ECSN identified with modern observing techniques.</p>
