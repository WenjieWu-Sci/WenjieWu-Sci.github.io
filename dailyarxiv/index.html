<p>2024-04-11, <strong>Haldane graphene billiards versus relativistic neutrino billiards</strong>, Dung Xuan Nguyen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07679v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.07679v1</a></p>

<p>We study fluctuation properties in the energy spectra of finite-size honeycomb lattices, graphene billiards, subject to the Haldane-model onsite potential and next-nearest neighbor interaction at critical points, referred to as Haldane graphene billiards in the following. The billiards had the shapes of a rectangular billiard with integrable dynamics, one with chaotic dynamics, and one whose shape has, in addition, threefold rotational symmetry. It had been shown that the spectral properties of the graphene billiards coincide with those of the nonrelativistic quantum billiard with the corresponding shape, both at the band edges and in the region of low energy excitations around the Dirac points at zero energy. There, the dispersion relation is linear and, accordingly, the spectrum is described by the same relativistic Dirac equation for massless half-spin particles as relativistic neutrino billiards, whose spectral properties agree with those of nonrelativistic quantum billiards with violated time-reversal invariance. Deviations from the expected behavior are attributed to differing boundary conditions and backscattering at the boundary, which leads to a mixing of valley states corresponding to the two Dirac points, that are mapped into each other through time reversal. We employ a Haldane model to introduce a gap at one of the two Dirac points so that backscattering is suppressed in the energy region of the gap and demonstrate that there the correlations in the spectra comply with those of the neutrino billiard of the corresponding shape.</p>

<p>2024-04-11, <strong>Neutral-current background induced by atmospheric neutrinos at large liquid-scintillator detectors: III. Quantitative calculations for reactor neutrinos</strong>, Jie Cheng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07429v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.07429v1</a></p>

<p>Atmospheric neutrinos contribute significantly to irreducible backgrounds through their neutral-current (NC) interactions with $^{12}$C nuclei in liquid-scintillator detectors, impacting diffuse supernova neutrino background, nucleon decay, and reactor neutrinos. This paper extends our prior work by systematically studying the NC backgrounds towards the MeV region of reactor neutrinos. We employ contemporary neutrino generator models from GENIE and NuWro for calculations, with a focus on predicting NC background in experimental searches for inverse-beta-decay signals below 100 MeV visible energy. We estimate the systematic uncertainty to our estimation of the NC background using various data-driven neutrino generator models, addressing factors such as the initial neutrino-nucleon NC interaction, the nuclear model, the final-state interaction model, the nucleus deexcitation, and the secondary interaction on final-state particles.</p>

<p>2024-04-10, <strong>Proto-Neutron Star Convection and the Neutrino-Driven Wind: Implications for the $ν$p-Process</strong>, Brian Nevins et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07324v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.07324v1</a></p>

<p>Recent studies of the neutrino-driven wind from proto-neutron stars have indicated that the wind is likely proton-rich for much of its lifetime, and the high flux of neutrinos can induce $\nu$p-process nucleosynthesis allowing for the formation of heavy elements. It has also been shown that gravito-acoustic waves, generated by convection within the proto-neutron star, can significantly alter the dynamics and nucleosynthesis in the wind. Therefore, we present a study of the effects of convection-driven waves on the nucleosynthesis in proton-rich neutrino-driven winds, focusing on the $\nu$p-process. We find that wave effects can strongly impact $\nu$p-process nucleosynthesis even at wave luminosities a factor of $10^{-5}$ smaller than the total neutrino luminosity. The momentum flux of the waves accelerates the wind, reducing the net neutrino heating and the persistent neutron abundance created by p($\bar{\nu}_e,e^+$), which impedes $\nu$p-process nucleosynthesis. However, this effect is generally counteracted by the effects of waves on seed nucleus formation, as the acceleration of the wind and the heating that occurs as these waves shock both favor a more $\alpha$-rich environment with very little heavy seed-nucleus formation. Overall, higher wave luminosities correlate (albeit non-monotonically) with heavier element $\nu$p-processing, up to $A\approx 200$ in some cases. At very high wave luminosities ($\gtrsim 10^{-3}L_\nu$), early shock heating by the waves disrupts $\alpha$ recombination, and drives a suppressed, fast-outflow r-process proceeding up to $A\approx 200$. This occurs despite an assumed neutrino spectrum that predicts a proton-rich wind with equilibrium $Y_e=0.6$.</p>

<p>2024-04-10, <strong>Comparing Compressed and Full-modeling Analyses with FOLPS: Implications for DESI 2024 and beyond</strong>, H. E. Noriega et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07269v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.07269v1</a></p>

<p>The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) will provide unprecedented information about the large-scale structure of our Universe. In this work, we study the robustness of the theoretical modelling of the power spectrum of FOLPS, a novel effective field theory-based package for evaluating the redshift space power spectrum in the presence of massive neutrinos. We perform this validation by fitting the AbacusSummit high-accuracy $N$-body simulations for Luminous Red Galaxies, Emission Line Galaxies and Quasar tracers, calibrated to describe DESI observations. We quantify the potential systematic error budget of FOLPS, finding that the modelling errors are fully sub-dominant for the DESI statistical precision within the studied range of scales. Additionally, we study two complementary approaches to fit and analyse the power spectrum data, one based on direct Full-Modelling fits and the other on the ShapeFit compression variables, both resulting in very good agreement in precision and accuracy. In each of these approaches, we study a set of potential systematic errors induced by several assumptions, such as the choice of template cosmology, the effect of prior choice in the nuisance parameters of the model, or the range of scales used in the analysis. Furthermore, we show how opening up the parameter space beyond the vanilla $\Lambda$CDM model affects the DESI observables. These studies include the addition of massive neutrinos, spatial curvature, and dark energy equation of state. We also examine how relaxing the usual Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis priors on the primordial spectral index and the baryonic matter abundance, respectively, impacts the inference on the rest of the parameters of interest. This paper pathways towards performing a robust and reliable analysis of the shape of the power spectrum of DESI galaxy and quasar clustering using FOLPS.</p>

<p>2024-04-10, <strong>Neutrino at different epochs of the Friedmann Universe</strong>, A. V. Ivanchik et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07081v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.07081v1</a></p>

<p>Nowadays, at least two relics of the Big Bang have survived - the cosmological microwave background (CMB) and the cosmological neutrino background (C$\nu$B). Being the second most abundant particle in the Universe, the neutrino has a significant impact on its evolution from the Big Bang to the present day. Neutrinos affect the following cosmological processes: the expansion rate of the Universe, its chemical and isotopic composition, the CMB anisotropy and the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Another relic neutrino background is theoretically predicted, it consists of non-equilibrium antineutrinos of Primordial Nucleosynthesis arising as a result of the decays of neutrons and tritium nuclei. Such antineutrinos are an indicator of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In addition to experimentally detectable active neutrinos, the existence of sterile neutrinos is theoretically predicted to generate neutrino masses and explain their oscillations. Sterile neutrinos can also solve such cosmological problems as the baryonic asymmetry of the Universe and the nature of dark matter. The recent results of several independent experiments point to the possibility of the existence of a light sterile neutrino. However, the existence of such a neutrino is inconsistent with the predictions of the Standard Cosmological Model. The inclusion of a non-zero lepton asymmetry of the Universe and/or increasing the energy density of active neutrinos can eliminate these contradictions and reconcile the possible existence of sterile neutrinos with Primordial Nucleosynthesis, the CMB anisotropy, and also reduce the H$_0$-tension. In this brief review, we discuss the influence of the physical properties of active and sterile neutrinos on the evolution of the Universe from the Big Bang to the present day.</p>

<p>2024-04-10, <strong>A correlation between hard X-rays and neutrinos in radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN</strong>, Emma Kun et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06867v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.06867v1</a></p>

<p>The production mechanism of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos is not yet understood. A common assumption is that beamed relativistic outflows (jets) driven by accreting black holes are needed to accelerate particles to such high energies to produce high-energy neutrinos. Indeed, the first astrophysical high-energy neutrino source candidate identified by IceCube at a significance level of $&gt;3\sigma$ was a blazar – an AGN with an accreting supermassive black hole that drives a relativistic jet directed towards Earth. Recently, IceCube discovered strong evidence that Seyfert galaxies also emit neutrinos, which appears unrelated to jet activity. Here, we show that the neutrino–hard X-ray flux ratio of the blazar TXS 0506+056 is consistent with neutrino production in a $\gamma$-obscured region near the central supermassive black hole, with the X-ray flux corresponding to reprocessed $\gamma$-ray emission with flux comparable to that of neutrinos. Similar neutrino–hard X-ray flux ratios were found for three of IceCube’s Seyfert galaxies, raising the possibility of a common neutrino production mechanism that may not involve a strong jet. We examine how future observations could test the jet origin of blazar neutrinos.</p>

<p>2024-04-11, <strong>Dilaton Forbidden Dark Matter</strong>, Thomas Appelquist et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07601v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.07601v1</a></p>

<p>Dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) describes the long distance behavior of certain confining, near-conformal gauge theories that have been studied via lattice computation. Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGBs), emerging from the breaking of approximate, continuous, internal symmetries, are coupled to an additional scalar particle, the dilaton, arising from the spontaneous breaking of approximate scale invariance. This effective theory has been employed to study possible extensions of the standard model. In this paper, we propose a complementary role for dEFT, as a description of the dark matter of the universe, with the pNGBs identified as the dark-matter particles. We show that this theory provides a natural implementation of the ``forbidden’’ dark matter mechanism, and we identify regions of parameter space for which the thermal history of dEFT yields the measured dark matter relic density.</p>

<p>2024-04-10, <strong>One-loop power spectrum in ultra slow-roll inflation and implications for primordial black hole dark matter</strong>, Guillermo Ballesteros et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07196v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.07196v1</a></p>

<p>We apply the in-in formalism to address the question of whether the size of the one-loop spectrum of curvature fluctuations in ultra-slow-roll inflation models designed for producing a large population of primordial black holes implies a breakdown of perturbation theory. We consider a simplified piece-wise description of inflation, in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is preceded and followed by slow-roll phases linked by transitional periods. We work in the $\delta\phi$-gauge, including all relevant cubic and quartic interactions and the necessary counterterms to renormalize the ultraviolet divergences, regularized by a cutoff. The ratio of the one-loop to the tree-level contributions to the spectrum of curvature perturbations is controlled by the duration of the ultra-slow-roll phase and of the transitions. Our results indicate that perturbation theory does not necessarily break in well-known models proposed to account for all the dark matter in the form of primordial black holes.</p>

<p>2024-04-10, <strong>Constraining Bosonic Dark Matter-Baryon Interactions from Neutron Star Collapse</strong>, Chih-Ting Lu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07187v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.07187v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter (DM) may be captured around a neutron star (NS) through DM-nucleon interactions. We observe that the enhancement of such capturing is particularly significant when the DM velocity and/or momentum transfer depend on the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section. This could potentially lead to the formation of a black hole within the typical lifetime of the NS. As the black hole expands through the accretion of matter from the NS, it ultimately results in the collapse of the host. Utilizing the existing pulsar data J0437-4715 and J2124-3858, we derive the stringent constraints on the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section across a broad range of DM masses.</p>

<p>2024-04-10, <strong>Search for a light muon-philic $Z’$ with the NA64-$e$ experiment at CERN</strong>, Yu. M. Andreev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06982v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.06982v1</a></p>

<p>The inclusion of an additional U(1) gauge $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ symmetry would release the tension between the measured and the predicted value of the anomalous muon magnetic moment: this paradigm assumes the existence of a new, light $Z’$ vector boson, with dominant coupling to ${\mu}$ and ${\tau}$ and interacting with electrons via a loop mechanism. The $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ model can also explain the Dark Matter relic abundance, by assuming that the $Z’$ boson acts as a “portal” to a new Dark Sector of particles in Nature, not charged under known interactions. In this work we present the results of the $Z’$ search performed by the NA64-$e$ experiment at CERN SPS, that collected $ \sim 9 \times 10^{11}$ 100-GeV electrons impinging on an active thick target. Despite the suppressed $Z’$ production yield with an electron beam, the limits sets by NA64-$e$ are competitive with other experimental searches, and partially exclude the $g-2$ preferred model parameter values for $Z’$ masses lighter than 2 MeV. This result proves the complementarity of this search with NA64-${\mu}$, the parallel effort of the NA64 collaboration with a muon beam.</p>

<p>2024-04-10, <strong>Constraining Cosmological Physics with DESI BAO Observations</strong>, Deng Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06796v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.06796v1</a></p>

<p>The DESI year one observations can help probe new physics on cosmological scales. In light of the latest DESI BAO measurements, we constrain four popular cosmological scenarios including inflation, modified gravity, annihilating dark matter and interacting dark energy. Using a data combination of BICEP/Keck array, cosmic microwave background and DESI, we obtain the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.05}= 0.0176^{+0.0070}_{-0.0130}$ and $r_{0.05}=0.018^{+0.020}_{-0.017}$. Using the combination of cosmic microwave background and DESI, we find a $2.4\sigma$ evidence for gravitational theories beyond the general relativity, shrinks the dark matter annihilation cross-section by $12\%$ relative to cosmic microwave background, and obtain a $1.6\sigma$ hint of the positive interaction between dark matter and dark energy indicating that energy may be transferred from dark matter to dark energy in the dark sector of the universe. Future DESI observations could go a step further to explore the nature of inflation, dark matter and dark energy, and test the validity of general relativity on cosmological scales.</p>

<p>2024-04-10, <strong>Scalar Field Dark Matter Around Charged Black Holes</strong>, Yuri Ravanal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06774v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.06774v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we investigate the behavior of a massive scalar field dark matter scenarios in the large mass limit around a central Reissner-Nordstr"{o}m black hole. This study is motivated by observations from the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration, which does not exclude the possibility of the existence of such black holes. Through these inquiries, we uncover that the electric charge may significantly impact the scalar field profile and the density profile in the vecinty of the black hole. For the maximum electric charge allowed by the constraints of the Event Horizon Telescope, the maximum accretion rate decreases by $\thicksim$ 50 \% compared to the Schwarszchild case for marginally bound orbits. The maximum accretion rate of the massive scalar field is approximately $\dot M_{\text{SFDM}} \thicksim 10^{-8} M_{\odot} \;\text{yr}^{-1}$, which is significantly lower than the typical baryonic accretion rate commonly found in the literature. This implies that the scalar cloud located at the center of galaxies may have survived untill present times.</p>

<p>2024-04-11, <strong>Supernova remnants of red supergiants: from barrels to Cygnus loops</strong>, D M A Meyer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07873v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.07873v1</a></p>

<p>Core-collapse supernova remnants are the nebular leftover of defunct massive stars which have died during a supernova explosion, mostly while undergoing the red supergiant phase of their evolution. The morphology and emission properties of those remnants are a function of the distribution of circumstellar material at the moment of the supernova, the intrisic properties of the explosion, as well as those of the ambient medium. By means of 2.5 dimensional numerical magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we model the long term evolution of supernova remnants generated by runaway rotating massive stars moving into a magnetised interstellar medium. Radiative transfer calculations reveal that the projected non-thermal emission of the supernova remnants decreases with time, i.e. older remnants are fainter than younger ones. Older (80 kyr) supernova remnants whose progenitors were moving with space velocity corresponding to a Mach number M = 1 (v_star = 20 km/s ) in the Galactic plane of the ISM (nISM = 1/cm3 ) are brighter in synchrotron than when moving with a Mach number M = 2 (v_star = 40 km/s ). We show that runaway red supergiant progenitors first induce an asymmetric non thermal 1.4 GHz barrel like synchrotron supernova remnants (at the age of about 8 kyr), before further evolving to adopt a Cygnus loop like shape (at about 80 kyr). It is conjectured that a significative fraction of supernova remnants are currently in this bilateral-to-Cygnus-loop evolutionary sequence, and that this should be taken into account in the data interpretation of the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory.</p>

<p>2024-04-11, <strong>Self-interacting dark sectors in supernovae are fluid</strong>, Damiano F. G. Fiorillo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07714v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.07714v1</a></p>

<p>We revisit supernova (SN) bounds on a hidden sector consisting of millicharged particles $\chi$ and a massless dark photon. Unless the self-coupling is fine-tuned to be small, rather than exiting the SN core as a gas, the particles form a relativistic fluid and subsequent dark QED fireball, streaming out against the drag due to the interaction with matter. Novel bounds due to excessive energy deposition in the mantle of low-energy SNe can be obtained. The cooling bounds from SN~1987A are unexpectedly not affected in the free-streaming regime. The inclusion of $\chi\bar{\chi}\rightarrow \rm SM$ substantially modifies the constraints in the trapping regime, which can only be treated hydrodynamically. Our results can be adapted to generic sub-GeV self-interacting dark sectors.</p>

<p>I further study the manner by which a pair of opposite jets shape the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keyhole' morphological structure of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 1997A, now the CCSN remnant (CCSNR) 1987A. By doing so, I strengthen the claim that the jittering-jet explosion mechanism (JJEM) accounts for most, likely all, CCSNe. The </code>keyhole’ structure comprises a northern low-intensity zone closed with a bright rim on its front and an elongated low-intensity nozzle in the south. This rim-nozzle asymmetry is observed in some cooling flow clusters and planetary nebulae that are observed to be shaped by jets. I build a toy model that uses the planar jittering jets pattern, where consecutive pairs of jets tend to jitter in a common plane, implying that the accreted gas onto the newly born neutron star at the late explosion phase flows perpendicular to that plane. This allows for a long-lived jet-launching episode. This long-lasting jet-launching episode launches more mass into the jets that can inflate larger pairs of ears or bubbles, forming the main jets’ axis of the CCSNR that is not necessarily related to a possible pre-collapse core rotation. I discuss the relation of the main jets’ axis to the neutron star’s natal kick velocity.</p>

<p>2024-04-10, <strong>Prospects of the multi-channel photometric survey telescope in the cosmological application of Type Ia supernovae</strong>, Zhenyu Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07246v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.07246v1</a></p>

<p>The Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) is a real-time, three-color photometric system designed to capture the color evolution of stars and transients accurately. This telescope system can be crucial in cosmological distance measurements of low-redshift (low-$z$, $z$ $\lesssim 0.1$) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). To optimize the capabilities of this instrument, we perform a comprehensive simulation study before its official operation is scheduled to start. By considering the impact of atmospheric extinction, weather conditions, and the lunar phase at the observing site involving the instrumental features, we simulate the light curves of SNe Ia obtained by the Mephisto. The best strategy in the case of SN Ia cosmology is to take the image at an exposure time of 130 s with a cadence of 3 days. In this condition, Mephisto can obtain hundreds of high-quality SNe Ia to achieve a distance measurement better than $4.5\%$. Given the on-time spectral classification and monitoring of the Lijiang 2.4 m Telescope at the same observatory, Mephisto, in the whole operation, can significantly enrich the well-calibrated sample of supernovae at low-$z$ and improve the calibration accuracy of high-$z$ SNe Ia.</p>

<p>2024-04-10, <strong>Studying the Supernova Absolute Magnitude Constancy with Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations</strong>, Denitsa Staicova et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07182v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.07182v1</a></p>

<p>In this proceeding we review and expand on our recent work investigating the constancy of the absolute magnitude $M_B$ of Type Ia supernovae. In it, we used baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) to calibrate the supernova data and to check whether the resulting $M_B$ is constant. We used non-parametric methods like Gaussian processes and artificial neural networks to reconstruct $M_B(z)$. Here we elaborate on the results by putting them in the context of other studies investigating possible non-constant $M_B$ and the impact of the distance-duality relation. We also present some numerical details on the calculations in the original paper and new non-parametric reconstructions, including a conservative model-independent fit, confirming its main results. Notably, we see that $M_B$ remains constant within $1\sigma$, with a possible jump around $z = 0.01 - 0.15$. Furthermore, the observed distribution of $M_B(z)$ cannot be described by a single Gaussian, displaying multiple peaks and tails. The choice of the only remaining parameter – the sound horizon $r_d$ leads to a tension in the $M_B-r_d$ plane. Fitting different non-constant $M_B(z)$ models does not significantly improve the fit and there is no preference for any of the models by the statistical measures we employ.</p>

<p>Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn, play important roles in the formation and habitability of Earth-like planets. The detection of solar system analogs that have multiple cold giant planets is essential for our understanding of planet habitability and planet formation. Although transit surveys such as Kepler and TESS have discovered thousands of exoplanets, these missions are not sensitive to long period planets due to their limited observation baseline. The Tianyu project, comprising two 1-meter telescopes (Tianyu-I and II), is designed to detect transiting cold giant planets in order to find solar system analogs. Featuring a large field of view and equipped with a high-speed CMOS camera, Tianyu-I will perform a high-precision photometric survey of about 100 million stars, measuring light curves at hour-long cadence. The candidates found by Tianyu-I will be confirmed by Tianyu-II and other surveys and follow-up facilities through multi-band photometry, spectroscopy, and high resolution imaging. Tianyu telescopes will be situated at an elevation about 4000 meters in Lenghu, China. With a photometric precision of 1% for stars with V &lt; 18 mag, Tianyu is expected to find more than 300 transiting exoplanets, including about 12 cold giant planets, over five years. A five-year survey of Tianyu would discover 1-2 solar system analogs. Moreover, Tianyu is also designed for non-exoplanetary exploration, incorporating multiple survey modes covering timescales from sub-seconds to months, with a particular emphasis on events occurring within the sub-second to hour range. It excels in observing areas such as infant supernovae, rare variable stars and binaries, tidal disruption events, Be stars, cometary activities, and interstellar objects. These discoveries not only enhance our comprehension of the universe but also offer compelling opportunities for public engagement in scientific exploration.</p>

<p>2024-04-10, <strong>Model independent cosmographic constraints from DESI 2024</strong>, Orlando Luongo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07070v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.07070v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, we explore model independent constraints on the universe kinematics up to the snap and jerk hierarchical terms. To do so, we consider the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) release provided by the DESI collaboration, tackling the $r_d$ parameter to span within the range $[144,152]$ Mpc, with fixed step, $\delta r_d=2$ Mpc, aligning with Planck and DESI results. Thus, employing Monte Carlo Markov chain analyses, we place stringent constraints on the cosmographic series, incorporating three combinations of data catalogs: the first BAO with observational Hubble data, the second BAO with type Ia supernovae, and the last including all three data sets. Our results conclusively constrain the cosmographic series, say the deceleration $q_0$, the jerk $j_0$, and the snap $s_0$ parameters, at the $2$–$\sigma$ level, showcasing a significant departure on $j_0$ even at $1$–$\sigma$ confidence level, albeit being compatible with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm on $q_0$ and $s_0$, at $2$–$\sigma$ level. Analogously, the $h_0$ tension appears alleviated in the second hierarchy, say including snap. Finally, a direct comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM models and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization is reported, definitively favoring the wCDM scenario.</p>
