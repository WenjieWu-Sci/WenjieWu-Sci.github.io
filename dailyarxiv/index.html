<p>2023-11-27, <strong>SPY: A Magnet System for a High-pressure Gaseous TPC Neutrino Detector</strong>, Andrea Bersani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16063v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.16063v1</a></p>

<p>We present a novel conceptual design for a magnet system that provides the magnetic field necessary for the analysis of tracks in a high-pressure gaseous argon TPC while simultaneously serving as a pressure vessel to contain the TPC gas volume. The magnet was developed within a Near Detector proposal for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The high-pressure gaseous argon TPC is a component proposed to be one of the elements of an ensemble of near detectors that are needed for DUNE</p>

<p>2023-11-27, <strong>Phenomenology of the flavor symmetric scoto-seesaw model with dark matter and TM$_1$ mixing</strong>, Joy Ganguly et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15997v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.15997v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a hybrid scoto-seesaw model based on the $A_4$ non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetry. Light neutrino masses come from the tree-level type-I seesaw mechanism and from the one-loop scotogenic contribution accommodating viable dark matter candidates responsible for observed relic abundance of dark matter (DM). Respectively, both these contributions restore the atmospheric and solar neutrino mass scales. With only one right-handed neutrino, the model features specific predictions with the normal ordering of light neutrino masses, the lightest neutrino being massless, and only one relevant CP Majorana phase. The flavor symmetric setup helps us to realize the TM$_1$ mixing scheme with concrete correlations and constraints on the mixing angles and associated CP phases. The framework predicts the atmospheric mixing angle to be in the upper octant with specific ranges $0.531 (0.580) \leq \sin^2\theta_{23}\leq 0.544 (0.595)$ and the Dirac CP phase is restricted within the range $\pm(1.44-1.12)$ radian. The Majorana phase is also tightly constrained with a range of $0.82-0.95$ and $1.58-1.67$ radian, which is otherwise unconstrained from neutrino oscillations. Strict predictions on the Majorana phases also yield an accurate prediction for the effective mass parameter for neutrinoless double beta within the range of $1.61-3.85$ meV. The model offers a rich phenomenology regarding DM relic density and direct search constraints, and the fermionic DM scenario has been discussed in detail, estimating its possible connection with the neutrino sector. As an example of the model studies at colliders, the SM Higgs in the diphoton decay channel is examined. The model predicts strictly vanishing $\tau \to e\gamma$, $\tau \rightarrow 3e$ decays and testable signals by MEG-II and SINDRUM/Mu3e experiments for the $\mu \to e \gamma$ and $\mu \to 3 e$ decays, respectively.</p>

<p>2023-11-27, <strong>Neutron stars in accreting systems – signatures of the QCD phase transition</strong>, Noshad Khosravi Largani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15992v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.15992v1</a></p>

<p>Neutron stars (NS) that are born in binary systems, with a main sequence star companion, can experience mass transfer, resulting in the accumulation of material at the NS’s surface. This, in turn, leads to the continuous growth of the NS mass and the associated steepening of the gravitational potential. If the central density surpasses the onset for the phase transition from nuclear, generally hadronic matter to deconfined quark-gluon plasma-a quantity currently constrained solely from an upper limit by asymptotic freedom in QCD-the system may experience a dynamic response due to the appearance of additional degrees of freedom in the equation of state (EOS). This might give rise to a rapid softening of the EOS during the transition in the hadron-quark matter co-existence region. Whilst this phenomenon has long been studied in the context of hydrostatic configurations, the dynamical implications of this problem are yet incompletely understood. It is the essence of the present paper to simulate the dynamics of NS, with previously accreted envelopes, caused by the presence of a first-order QCD phase transition. Therefore, the neutrino radiation hydrodynamics treatment is employed based on the fully general relativistic approach in spherical symmetry, implementing three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport and a microscopic model EOS that contains a first-order hadron-quark phase transition. The associated neutrino signal shows a sudden rise of the neutrino fluxes and average energies, becoming observable for the present generation of neutrino detectors for a galactic event, and a gravitational wave mode analysis reveals the behaviors of the dominant $f$ and first gravity $g$ modes that are being excited during the NS evolution across the QCD phase transition.</p>

<p>2023-11-27, <strong>Bounds on ALP-Mediated Dark Matter Models from Celestial Objects</strong>, Tanech Klangburam et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15681v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.15681v1</a></p>

<p>We have studied the signals from axion-like particles (ALPs) as dark matter mediators from celestial objects such as neutron stars or brown dwarfs. We consider the accumulation of dark matter inside the celestial objects using the multiscatter capturing process. The production of ALP from the dark matter annihilation can escape the celestial object and decay into gamma-ray and neutrinos before reaching the Earth. We investigate our model using gamma-ray observations from Fermi and H.E.S.S and neutrino observations from IceCube and ANTARES. The effective Lagrangian approach allows us to place constraints on the ALP-photon and ALP-fermion couplings. In the gamma-ray channel, our results improve the existing bounds on ALPs by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Although the constraints from neutrino fluxes rule out a significant portion of the parameter space, the remaining part of the parameter space is accessible by future experiments.</p>

<p>2023-11-27, <strong>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Predicting the Asymptotic Outcome of Fast Neutrino Flavor Conversions</strong>, Sajad Abbar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15656v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.15656v1</a></p>

<p>In the most extreme astrophysical environments, such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and neutron star mergers (NSMs), neutrinos can undergo fast flavor conversions (FFCs) on exceedingly short scales. Intensive simulations have demonstrated that FFCs can attain equilibrium states in certain models. In this study, we utilize physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to predict the asymptotic outcomes of FFCs, by specifically targeting the first two moments of neutrino angular distributions. This makes our approach suitable for state-of-the-art CCSN and NSM simulations. Through effective feature engineering and the incorporation of customized loss functions that penalize discrepancies in the predicted total number of $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$, our PINNs demonstrate remarkable accuracies, with an error margin of $\lesssim3\%$. Our study represents a substantial leap forward in the potential incorporation of FFCs into simulations of CCSNe and NSMs, thereby enhancing our understanding of these extraordinary astrophysical events.</p>

<p>2023-11-27, <strong>Top-philic ALP phenomenology at the LHC: the elusive mass-window</strong>, Simone Blasi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16048v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.16048v1</a></p>

<p>We study the LHC phenomenology of an Axion Like Particle (ALP) that couples only derivatively with the top quark at tree level. We inspect the radiatively induced couplings with the SM fermions and (gauge) bosons and the associated production and decay mechanisms of the ALP. We focus on the most challenging mass window that remains open for a top-philic ALP, i.e., the range between tens and hundreds of GeV. Not only ALP production processes but also virtual ALP contributions to final states with top quarks are considered in detail. We show how searches through resonant production, such as ALP production in association with a $t\bar t$ pair, are complementary to precision measurements of $t \bar t$ and $t\bar t t \bar t$ final states, the latter being competitive or even more powerful for a top-philic ALP in this mass window. Finally, we explore the scenario where the top-philic ALP acts as a mediator to a dark-matter sector, resulting in missing energy signatures at the LHC. We find that the LHC constraints from $t \bar t$, $t\bar t t \bar t$ and ALP + jet production, together with those from $t \bar t$ + ALP production, can already exclude a large fraction of the parameter space leading to the correct relic abundance.</p>

<p>2023-11-27, <strong>Mass reconstruction and noise reduction with cosmic-web environments</strong>, Feng Fang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15903v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.15903v1</a></p>

<p>The clustering of galaxies and their connections to their initial conditions is a major means by which we learn about cosmology. However, the stochasticity between galaxies and their underlying matter field is a major limitation for precise measurements of galaxy clustering. It also hinders accurate mass reconstruction for retrieving cosmological information from observations. Efforts have been made with an optimal weighting scheme to reduce this stochasticity using the mass-dependent clustering of dark matter halos, but its application to observation is challenging due to the difficulties in measuring the mass of halos precisely. Here, we show that this is not optimal. We demonstrate that the cosmic-web environments (voids, sheets, filaments \&amp; knots) of halos provide extra information for reducing stochasticity. Using the environmental information alone can increase the signal-to-noise of clustering by approximately a factor of 3, better than the Poisson level at the scales of the baryon acoustic oscillations. This improvement is comparable to using halo mass information alone. The information about the environment and halo mass are complementary. Their combination increases the signal-to-noise by another factor of 2-3. The information about the cosmic web correlates with other properties of halos, including halo concentrations and tidal forces, thus, these are among the most dominant factors that can help improve the reconstruction. We attribute the extra information from the environment and secondary properties of halos primarily to the assembly bias of halos. Our findings open a new avenue for mass reconstruction and noise reduction using information beyond the halo mass.</p>

<p>2023-11-27, <strong>Impact of shell model interactions on nuclear responses to WIMP elastic scattering</strong>, Raghda Abdel Khaleq et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15764v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.15764v1</a></p>

<p>Background: Nuclear recoil from scattering with weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) is a signature searched for in direct detection of dark matter. The underlying WIMP-nucleon interactions could be spin and/or orbital angular momentum (in)dependent. Evaluation of nuclear recoil rates through these interactions requires accounting for nuclear structure, e.g., through shell model calculations.   Purpose: To evaluate nuclear response functions induced by these interactions for $^{19}$F, $^{23}$Na, $^{28, 29, 30}$Si, $^{40}$Ar, $^{70,72,73,74,76}$Ge, $^{127}$I, and $^{128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 134, 136}$Xe nuclei that are relevant to current direct detection experiments, and to estimate their sensitivity to shell model interactions.   Methods: Shell model calculations are performed with the NuShellX solver. Nuclear response functions from non-relativistic effective field theory (NREFT) are evaluated and integrated over transferred momentum for quantitative comparisons.   Results: Although the standard spin independent response is barely sensitive to the structure of the nuclei, large variations with the shell model interaction are often observed for the other channels.   Conclusions: Significant uncertainties may arise from the nuclear components of WIMP-nucleus scattering amplitudes due to nuclear structure theory and modelling. These uncertainties should be accounted for in analyses of direct detection experiments.</p>

<p>2023-11-27, <strong>HI in high gas-phase metallicity dwarf galaxy WISEA J230615.06+143927.9</strong>, Yan Guo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15724v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.15724v1</a></p>

<p>We present resolved GMRT HI observations of the high gas-phase metallicity dwarf galaxy WISEA J230615.06+143927.9 (z = 0.005) (hereafter J2306) and investigate whether it could be a Tidal Dwarf Galaxy (TDG) candidate. TDGs are observed to have higher metallicities than normal dwarfs. J2306 has an unusual combination of a blue g – r colour of 0.23 mag, irregular optical morphology and high-metallicity (12 + log(O/H) = 8.68$\pm$0.14), making it an interesting galaxy to study in more detail. We find J2306 to be an HI rich galaxy with a large extended, unperturbed rotating HI disk. Using our HI data we estimated its dynamical mass and found the galaxy to be dark matter (DM) dominated within its HI radius. The quantity of DM, inferred from its dynamical mass, appears to rule out J2306 as an evolved TDG. A wide area environment search reveals J2306 to be isolated from any larger galaxies which could have been the source of its high gas metallicity. Additionally, the HI morphology and kinematics of the galaxy show no indication of a recent merger to explain the high-metallicity. Further detailed optical spectroscopic observations of J2306 might provide an answer to how a seemingly ordinary irregular dwarf galaxy achieved such a high level of metal enrichment.</p>

<p>2023-11-27, <strong>NN bundle method applied to cosmology: an improvement in computational times</strong>, Augusto T. Chantada et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15955v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.15955v1</a></p>

<p>In the last few years, there has been significant progress in the development of machine learning methods tailored to astrophysics and cosmology. Among the various methods that have been developed, there is one that allows to obtain a bundle of solutions of differential systems without the need of using traditional numerical solvers. We have recently applied this to the cosmological scenario and showed that in some cases the computational times of the inference process can be reduced. In this paper, we present an improvement to the neural network bundle method that results in a significant reduction of the computational times of the statistical analysis. The novelty of the method consists in the use of the neural network bundle method to calculate the luminosity distance of type Ia supernovae, which is usually computed through an integral with numerical methods. In this work, we have applied this improvement to the Starobinsky $f(R)$ model, which is more difficult to integrate than the $f(R)$ models analyzed in our previous work. We performed a statistical analysis with data from type Ia supernovae of the Pantheon+ compilation and cosmic chronometers to estimate the values of the free parameters of the Starobinsky model. We show that the statistical analyses carried out with our new method require lower computational times than the ones performed with both the numerical and the neural network method from our previous work. This reduction in time is more significant in the case of a difficult computational problem such as the one we address in this work.</p>

<p>2023-11-27, <strong>SimSIMS: Simulation-based Supernova Ia Model Selection with thousands of latent variables</strong>, Konstantin Karchev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15650v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.15650v1</a></p>

<p>We present principled Bayesian model comparison through simulation-based neural classification applied to SN Ia analysis. We validate our approach on realistically simulated SN Ia light curve data, demonstrating its ability to recover posterior model probabilities while marginalizing over &gt;4000 latent variables. The amortized nature of our technique allows us to explore the dependence of Bayes factors on the true parameters of simulated data, demonstrating Occam’s razor for nested models. When applied to a sample of 86 low-redshift SNae Ia from the Carnegie Supernova Project, our method prefers a model with a single dust law and no magnitude step with host mass, disfavouring different dust laws for low- and high-mass hosts with odds in excess of 100:1.</p>

<p>2023-11-27, <strong>Galactic magnetic fields I. Theoretical model and scaling relations</strong>, Luke Chamandy et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15612v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2311.15612v1</a></p>

<p>Galactic dynamo models have generally relied on input parameters that are very challenging to constrain. We address this problem by developing a model that uses observable quantities as input: the galaxy rotation curve, the surface densities of the gas, stars and star formation rate, and the gas temperature. The model can be used to estimate parameters of the random and mean components of the magnetic field, as well as the gas scale height, root-mean-square velocity and the correlation length and time of the interstellar turbulence, in terms of the observables. We use our model to derive theoretical scaling relations for the quantities of interest, finding reasonable agreement with empirical scaling relations inferred from observation. We assess the dependence of the results on different assumptions about turbulence driving, finding that agreement with observations is improved by explicitly modeling the expansion and energetics of supernova remnants. The model is flexible enough to include alternative prescriptions for the physical processes involved, and we provide links to two open-source PYTHON programs that implement it.</p>
