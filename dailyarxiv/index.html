<p>2024-03-19, <strong>The FLAMINGO project: the coupling between baryonic feedback and cosmology in light of the $S_8$ tension</strong>, Willem Elbers et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12967v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.12967v1</a></p>

<p>Large-scale structure surveys have reported measurements of the density of matter, $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, and the amplitude of clustering, $\sigma_8$, that are in tension with the values inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background. While this may be a sign of new physics that slows the growth of structure at late times, strong astrophysical feedback processes could also be responsible. In this work, we argue that astrophysical processes are not independent of cosmology and that their coupling naturally leads to stronger baryonic feedback in cosmological models with suppressed structure formation or when combined with a mechanism that removes dark matter from halos. We illustrate this with two well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model known to suppress structure formation: massive neutrinos and decaying dark matter. Our results, based on the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, show that the combined effect of baryonic and non-baryonic suppression mechanisms is greater than the sum of its parts, particularly for decaying dark matter. We also show that the dependence of baryonic feedback on cosmology can be modelled as a function of the ratio $f_\mathrm{b}/c^2_\mathrm{v}\sim f_\mathrm{b}/(\Omega_\mathrm{m}\sigma_8)^{1/4}$ of the universal baryon fraction, $f_\mathrm{b}$, to a velocity-based definition of halo concentration, $c^2_\mathrm{v}$, giving an accurate fitting formula for the baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum. Although the combination of baryonic and non-baryonic suppression mechanisms can resolve the tension, the models with neutrinos and decaying dark matter are challenged by constraints on the expansion history.</p>

<p>2024-03-19, <strong>Calibration of the RED-100 detector at the Kalinin nuclear power plant</strong>, D. Yu. Akimov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12645v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.12645v1</a></p>

<p>RED-100 is a two-phase Xe detector designed and built for the study of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering CEvNS of reactor antineutrinos. A comprehensive calibration was performed in order to obtain important parameters of the detector during its exposition at the Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant (Tver, Russia). This paper describes the analysis of calibration data, position and energy reconstruction procedures, and evaluation of the efficiency of electron extraction from the liquid xenon to the gas phase.</p>

<p>2024-03-19, <strong>First Measurement of the $ν_e$ and $ν_μ$ Interaction Cross Sections at the LHC with FASER’s Emulsion Detector</strong>, Roshan Mammen Abraham et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12520v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.12520v1</a></p>

<p>This paper presents the first results of the study of high-energy electron and muon neutrino charged-current interactions in the FASER$\nu$ emulsion/tungsten detector of the FASER experiment at the LHC. A subset of the FASER$\nu$ volume, which corresponds to a target mass of 128.6~kg, was exposed to neutrinos from the LHC $pp$ collisions with a centre-of-mass energy of 13.6~TeV and an integrated luminosity of 9.5 fb$^{-1}$. Applying stringent selections requiring electrons with reconstructed energy above 200~GeV, four electron neutrino interaction candidate events are observed with an expected background of $0.025^{+0.015}_{-0.010}$, leading to a statistical significance of 5.2$\sigma$. This is the first direct observation of electron neutrino interactions at a particle collider. Eight muon neutrino interaction candidate events are also detected, with an expected background of $0.22^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$, leading to a statistical significance of 5.7$\sigma$. The signal events include neutrinos with energies in the TeV range, the highest-energy electron and muon neutrinos ever detected from an artificial source. The energy-independent part of the interaction cross section per nucleon is measured over an energy range of 560–1740 GeV (520–1760 GeV) for $\nu_e$ ($\nu_{\mu}$) to be $(1.2_{-0.7}^{+0.8}) \times 10^{-38}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ ($(0.5\pm0.2) \times 10^{-38}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$), consistent with Standard Model predictions. These are the first measurements of neutrino interaction cross sections in those energy ranges.</p>

<p>2024-03-19, <strong>Scalar dark matter explanation of the excess in the Belle II $B^+\to K^+ + \mbox{invisible}$ measurement</strong>, Xiao-Gang He et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12485v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.12485v1</a></p>

<p>Recently Belle II reported the first measurement of $B^+\to K^++\mbox{invisible (inv)}$, which is $2.7\sigma$ above the standard model (SM) prediction. If confirmed, this calls for new physics beyond SM. In the SM, the invisible particles are neutrino-anti-neutrino pairs. There are more possibilities when going beyond the SM. In this work, we focus on decays to dark matter (DM) and show that the $B\to K +\mathrm{inv}$ excess from Belle II and DM relic density can be simultaneously explained in a simple extension of the SM. The model introduces a real scalar singlet $\phi$ acting as a DM candidate, and two heavy vector-like quarks $Q,D$ with the same quantum numbers as the SM left-handed quark doublet and right-handed down-type quark singlet, respectively. All these new particles are odd under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry while the SM particles are even. The model can successfully explain the Belle II anomaly and DM relic density for TeV-scale heavy quarks with hierarchical Yukawa couplings involving $b$ and $s$ quarks. At the same time, it can easily satisfy other flavour physics and DM detection constraints.</p>

<p>2024-03-19, <strong>Revisiting the Dirac Nature of Neutrinos</strong>, Manash Dey et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12461v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.12461v1</a></p>

<p>Amid the uncertainty regarding the fundamental nature of neutrinos, we adhere to the Dirac one, and construct a model in the light of $\Delta(27)$ symmetry. The model is enriched by an additional $Z_{10}$ symmetry, to eliminate the possibility of the Majorana mass terms. The neutrino mass matrix exhibits four texture zeroes, and the associated mixing scheme aligns with the experimental data, notably controlled by a single parameter. In addition, the model emphasizes on the \emph{standard parametrization} of the lepton mixing matrix, which is crucial in the light of model building and neutrino physics experiments</p>

<p>2024-03-19, <strong>Development of low-radon ultra-pure water for the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory</strong>, T. Y. Guan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12414v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.12414v1</a></p>

<p>The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory(JUNO) is a state-of-the-art liquid scintillator-based neutrino physics experiment under construction in South China. To reduce the background from external radioactivities, a water Cherenkov detector composed of 35~kton ultra-pure water and 2,400 20-inch photomultiplier tubes is developed. Even after specialized treatment, ultra-pure water still contains trace levels of radioactive elements that can contribute to the detector background. Among which $^{222}$Rn is particularly significant. To address this, an online radon removal system based on the JUNO prototype has been developed. By integrating micro-bubble generators to enhance degasser’s radon removal efficiency, the radon concentration in water can be reduced to 1~mBq/m$^{3}$ level, meeting the stringent requirements of JUNO. Additionally, a highly sensitive online radon concentration measurement system capable of detecting concentrations $\sim$1~mBq/m$^3$ has been developed to monitor the radon concentration in water. In this paper, the details regarding both systems will be presented.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>Fast flavor conversions at the edge of instability</strong>, Damiano F. G. Fiorillo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12189v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.12189v1</a></p>

<p>A dense neutrino gas exhibiting angular crossings in the electron lepton number is unstable and develops fast flavor conversions. Instead of assuming an unstable configuration from the onset, we imagine that the system is externally driven toward instability. We use the simplest model of two neutrino beams initially of different flavor that either suddenly appear or one or both slowly build up. Flavor conversions commence well before the putative unstable state is fully attained, and the final outcome depends on how the system is driven. Our results suggest that in an astrophysical setting, one should focus less on flavor instabilities in the neutrino radiation field and more on the external dynamics that leads to the formation of the unstable state.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>Atomic binding corrections for high energy fixed target experiments</strong>, Ryan Plestid et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12184v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.12184v1</a></p>

<p>High energy beams incident on a fixed target may scatter against atomic electrons. To a first approximation, one can treat these electrons as at rest. For precision experiments, however, it is important to be able to estimate the size of, and when necessary calculate, sub-leading corrections. We discuss atomic binding corrections to relativistic lepton-electron scattering. We analyze hydrogen in detail, before generalizing our analysis to multi-electron atoms. Using the virial theorem, and many-body sum rules, we find that the corrections can be reduced to measured binding energies, and the expectation value of a single one-body operator. We comment on the phenomenological impact for neutrino flux normalization and an extraction of hadronic vacuum polarization from elastic muon electron scattering at MUonE.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>Atmospheric muons measured with the KM3NeT detectors in comparison with updated numeric predictions</strong>, The KM3NeT Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11946v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.11946v1</a></p>

<p>The measurement of the flux of muons produced in cosmic ray air showers is essential for the study of primary cosmic rays. Such measurements are important in extensive air shower detectors to assess the energy spectrum and the chemical composition of the cosmic ray flux, complementary to the information provided by fluorescence detectors. Detailed simulations of the cosmic ray air showers are carried out, using codes such as CORSIKA, to estimate the muon flux at sea level. These simulations are based on the choice of hadronic interaction models, for which improvements have been implemented in the post-LHC era. In this work, a deficit in simulations that use state-of-the-art QCD models with respect to the measurement deep underwater with the KM3NeT neutrino detectors is reported. The KM3NeT/ARCA and KM3NeT/ORCA neutrino telescopes are sensitive to TeV muons originating mostly from primary cosmic rays with energies around 10 TeV. The predictions of state-of-the-art QCD models show that the deficit with respect to the data is constant in zenith angle; no dependency on the water overburden is observed. The observed deficit at a depth of several kilometres is compatible with the deficit seen in the comparison of the simulations and measurements at sea level.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>NuGraph2: A Graph Neural Network for Neutrino Physics Event Reconstruction</strong>, V Hewes et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11872v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.11872v1</a></p>

<p>Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detector technology offers a wealth of high-resolution information on particle interactions, and leveraging that information to its full potential requires sophisticated automated reconstruction techniques. This article describes NuGraph2, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for low-level reconstruction of simulated neutrino interactions in a LArTPC detector. Simulated neutrino interactions in the MicroBooNE detector geometry are described as heterogeneous graphs, with energy depositions on each detector plane forming nodes on planar subgraphs. The network utilizes a multi-head attention message-passing mechanism to perform background filtering and semantic labelling on these graph nodes, identifying those associated with the primary physics interaction with 98.0\% efficiency and labelling them according to particle type with 94.9\% efficiency. The network operates directly on detector observables across multiple 2D representations, but utilizes a 3D-context-aware mechanism to encourage consistency between these representations. Model inference takes 0.12 s/event on a CPU, and 0.005 s/event batched on a GPU. This architecture is designed to be a general-purpose solution for particle reconstruction in neutrino physics, with the potential for deployment across a broad range of detector technologies, and offers a core convolution engine that can be leveraged for a variety of tasks beyond the two described in this article.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>Collider imprint of vector-like leptons in light of anomalous magnetic moment and neutrino data</strong>, Parham Dehghani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11862v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.11862v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the impact of incorporating anomaly-free representations of vector-like leptons into the Standard Model, aiming to address longstanding puzzles related to the anomalous magnetic moments of the muon and electron while maintaining consistency with neutrino masses and mixings. We find that among the various representations of vector-like leptons permitted by the Standard Model gauge symmetry, only weak doublets and singlets offer satisfactory solutions, all associated with a significantly constrained parameter space. Our analysis delves into the associated parameter space, identifying representative benchmark scenarios suitable for collider studies. These setups yield a distinctive six-lepton signature whose associated signals can easily be distinguished from the Standard Model background, providing a clear signal indicative of new physics models featuring vector-like leptons. Our work hence sheds light on the potential implications of vector-like leptons in resolving discrepancies inherent to the Standard Model, while also offering insights into experimental avenues for further exploration.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>Resolving the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions with neutrino mass and chemical potential</strong>, Shek Yeung et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11499v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.11499v1</a></p>

<p>A simple and natural extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is to allow relic neutrinos to have non-zero degeneracy. We confront this $\Lambda$CDM$\xi$ model, $\Lambda$CDM with neutrino mass $M_\nu$ and degeneracy $\xi_3$ as additional parameters, with the \textit{Planck} TT, lowT, plik–lensing, BAO, and DES datasets, and we observe a strong preference (Bayes factor $\log_{10}B=1.9$) for it over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are resolved to within 1$\sigma$ with the same set of neutrino parameters, along with 3$\sigma$ evidence for nonzero neutrino mass ($M_\nu=0.58^{+0.17}_{-0.13}\ \mathrm{eV}$) and degeneracy ($\xi_3=1.27^{+0.42}_{-0.22}$). Furthermore, our analysis favors the scalar index $n_s$ to be slightly larger than 1, compatible with some hybrid inflation models, as well as a significantly larger optical depth $\tau$ than the standard Planck value, indicating an earlier onset of reionization.</p>

<p>2024-03-19, <strong>Optical properties of Euler-Heisenberg black hole in the Cold Dark Matter Halo</strong>, Lei You et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12840v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.12840v1</a></p>

<p>The optical properties of Euler-Heisenberg (EH) black hole (BH) surrounded by Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halo are investigated. By changing BH’s parameters, we found that the radius of horizon r_{h} and radius of photon sphere r_{ph} will transparently increase as CDM halo parameters R and \rho increase. To show the influence of CDM halo on the BH’s optical characteristics, we took two sets of R and \rho with prominent differences and plot the first four orders of images for thin accretion disk with different angle of inclination \theta of observer. The images with light intensity distributions using Novikov-Thorne (N-T) model are also derived, as well as the effective potential, photon orbits. Especially, analysis of intersection behaviors between photon trajectories with different impact parameters and circular time-like orbits in accretion disk will help better understand the image of thin accretion disk. Our results showed that CDM halo will make BH become more larger and dimmer distinctly.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>Assessing the dark degeneracy through the gas mass fraction data</strong>, Dinorah Barbosa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12220v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.12220v1</a></p>

<p>It is well-known that Einstein’s equations constrain only the total energy-momentum tensor of the cosmic substratum, without specifying the characteristics of its individual constituents. Consequently, cosmological models featuring distinct decompositions within the dark sector, while sharing identical values for the sum of dark components’ energy-momentum tensor, remain indistinguishable when assessed through observables based on distance measurements. Notably, it has been already demonstrated that cosmological models with dynamical descriptions of dark energy, characterized by a time-dependent equation of state (EoS), can always be mapped into a model featuring a decaying vacuum ($w=-1$) coupled with dark matter. We explore the possibility of breaking this degeneracy by using measurements of the gas mass fraction observed in massive and relaxed galaxy clusters. This data is particularly interesting for this purpose because it isolates the matter contribution, possibly allowing the degeneracy breaking. We study the particular case of the $w$CDM model with its interactive counterpart. We compare the results obtained from both descriptions with a non-parametric analysis obtained through Gaussian Process. Even though the degeneracy may be broken from the theoretical point of view, we find that current gas mass fraction data seems to be insufficient for a final conclusion about which approach is favored, even when combined with SNIa, BAO and CMB.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>A unified model for the clustering of quasars and galaxies at $z\approx6$</strong>, Elia Pizzati et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12140v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.12140v1</a></p>

<p>Recent observations from the EIGER JWST program have measured for the first time the quasar-galaxy cross-correlation function at $z\approx6$. The auto-correlation function of faint $z\approx6$ quasars was also recently estimated. These measurements provide key insights into the properties of quasars and galaxies at high redshift and their relation with the host dark matter halos. In this work, we interpret these data building upon an empirical quasar population model that has been applied successfully to quasar clustering and demographic measurements at $z\approx2-4$. We make use of a new, large-volume N-body simulation with more than a trillion particles, FLAMINGO-10k, to model quasars and galaxies simultaneously. We successfully reproduce observations of $z\approx6$ quasars and galaxies (i.e., their clustering properties and luminosity functions), and infer key quantities such as their luminosity-halo mass relation, the mass function of their host halos, and their duty cycle/occupation fraction. Our key findings are: (i) quasars reside on average in $\approx10^{12.4}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ halos (corresponding to $\approx5\sigma$ fluctuations in the initial conditions of the linear density field), but the distribution of host halo masses is quite broad; (ii) the duty cycle of (UV-bright) quasar activity is relatively low ($\lesssim1\%$); (iii) galaxies (that are bright in [OIII]) live in much smaller halos ($\approx10^{10.9}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) and have a larger duty cycle (occupation fraction) of $\approx20\%$. Finally, we focus on the inferred properties of quasars and present a homogeneous analysis of their evolution with redshift. The picture that emerges reveals a strong evolution of the host halo mass and duty cycle of quasars at $z\approx2-6$, and calls for new investigations of the role of quasar activity across cosmic time.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>A deep learning model for the density profiles of subhaloes in IllustrisTNG</strong>, Luisa Lucie-Smith et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12125v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.12125v1</a></p>

<p>We present a machine-learning-based model for the total density profiles of subhaloes with masses $M \gtrsim 7\times 10^8\,h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$ in the IllustrisTNG100 simulation. The model is based on an interpretable variational encoder (IVE) which returns the independent factors of variation in the density profiles within a low-dimensional representation, as well as the predictions for the density profiles themselves. The IVE returns accurate and unbiased predictions on all radial ranges, including the outer region profile where the subhaloes experience tidal stripping; here its fit accuracy exceeds that of the commonly used Einasto profile. The IVE discovers three independent degrees of freedom in the profiles, which can be interpreted in terms of the formation history of the subhaloes. In addition to the two parameters controlling the normalization and inner shape of the profile, the IVE discovers a third parameter that accounts for the impact of tidal stripping onto the subhalo outer profile; this parameter is sensitive to the mass loss experienced by the subhalo after its infall onto its parent halo. Baryonic physics in the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model does not impact the number of degrees of freedom identified in the profile compared to the pure dark matter expectations, nor their physical interpretation. Our newly proposed profile fit can be used in strong lensing analyses or other observational studies which aim to constrain cosmology from small-scale structures.</p>

<p>Comparing different dark matter (DM) models, we explore the DM influence on black hole (BH) accretion disk physics, considering corotating and counterrotating thick accretion tori orbiting a central spinning BH. Our results identify accretion onto a central BH as a good indicator of DM presence, signaling possible DM tracers in accretion physics. We analyze accretion around a spinning BH immersed in perfect-fluid dark matter, cold dark matter and scalar field dark matter. Our investigation addresses observational evidence of distinctive DM effects on toroidal accretion disks and protojet configurations, proving that BH accretion tori immersed in DM can present characteristics, such as interdisk cusp or double tori, which have usually been considered as tracers for superspinars and naked singularity attractors. Therefore, in this context DM influence on the BH geometry could manifest as superspinar mimickers. DM also affects the central spinning attractor energetics associated with accretion physics, and its influence on accretion disks can be searched for in a variation of the central BH energetics as an increase of the mass accretion rates.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>Development of a low-background micro pixel chamber for directional dark matter searches</strong>, Ryota Namai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11736v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.11736v1</a></p>

<p>Direct detection of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can provide strong evidence of their existence and the directional method would have an advantage over other methods to detect the clear signal of WIMPs. Time projection chambers with micro-patterned gaseous detectors (MPGDs) are one of the common devices used in directional WIMP searches. A micro pixel chamber ({\mu}-PIC), one of the various types of MPGDs, with specially selected low background materials (LBG{\mu}-PIC) was developed and its performance was studied. The radon emission of the LBG{\mu}-PIC was less than 1/60 of that of the {\mu}-PIC currently in use. Although a non-negligible gain non- homogeneity was seen for the LBG{\mu}-PIC, it can be used for the directional WIMP search with the correction of the non-homogeneity.</p>

<p>We present the new ARTEMIS emulator suite of high resolution (baryon mass of $2.23 \times 10^{4}$ $h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$) zoom-in simulations of Milky Way mass systems. Here, three haloes from the original ARTEMIS sample have been rerun multiple times, systematically varying parameters for the stellar feedback model, the density threshold for star formation, the reionisation redshift and the assumed warm dark matter (WDM) particle mass (assuming a thermal relic). From these simulations emulators are trained for a wide range of statistics that allow for fast predictions at combinations of parameters not originally sampled, running in $\sim 1$ms (a factor of $\sim 10^{11}$ faster than the simulations). In this paper we explore the dependence of the central haloes’ stellar mass on the varied parameters, finding the stellar feedback parameters to be the most important. When constraining the parameters to match the present-day stellar mass halo mass relation inferred from abundance matching we find that there is a strong degeneracy in the stellar feedback parameters, corresponding to a freedom in formation time of the stellar component for a fixed halo assembly history. We additionally explore the dependence of the satellite stellar mass function, where it is found that variations in stellar feedback, the reionisation redshift and the WDM mass all have a significant effect. The presented emulators are a powerful tool which allows for fundamentally new ways of analysing and interpreting cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Crucially, allowing their free (subgrid) parameters to be varied and marginalised, leading to more robust constraints and predictions.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>Tidal Formation of dark matter deficit diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2 by SIDM</strong>, Zhao-Chen Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11403v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.11403v1</a></p>

<p>Observations have revealed a significant dark matter deficit in the ultra-diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2 (DF2). It is widely accepted that the formation of this unique galaxy can be attributed to the tidal stripping of its host galaxy, NGC1052. In this study, we simulate the evolution of a satellite system containing globular clusters (GCs) within an accreting host halo in the framework of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). Our simulation results suggest that the heightened tidal stripping resulting from self-interaction can give rise to the transformation of a conventional dwarf galaxy into a galaxy resembling DF2 in all its observed properties. By comparing the simulation results with identical initial conditions in both the standard cold dark matter (CDM) and SIDM models, we find that the latter is more likely to replicate the properties of DF2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a DF2 analog can also be produced on an orbit with a greater pericenter distance by increasing the strength of self-interaction. This suggests that the issue of extreme orbital parameters can be mitigated by implementing the SIDM model. The distributions of the GC population derived in our SIDM simulation are consistent with the observed characteristics of DF2. For comparison, we also explored the potential for achieving GC distributions in the context of CDM.</p>

<p>2024-03-19, <strong>The physics of Core-Collapse Supernovae: explosion mechanism and explosive nucleosynthesis</strong>, Luca Boccioli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12942v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.12942v1</a></p>

<p>Recent developments in multi-dimensional simulations of core-collapse supernovae have considerably improved our understanding of this complex phenomenon. In addition to that, one-dimensional (1D) studies have been employed to study the explosion mechanism and its causal connection to the pre-collapse structure of the star, as well as to explore the vast parameter space of supernovae. Nonetheless, many uncertainties still affect the late stages of the evolution of massive stars, their collapse, and the subsequent shock propagation. In this review, we will briefly summarize the state-of-the-art of both 1D and 3D simulations and how they can be employed to study the evolution of massive stars, supernova explosions, and shock propagation, focusing on the uncertainties that affect each of these phases. Finally, we will illustrate the typical nucleosynthesis products that emerge from the explosion.</p>

<p>The interstellar medium (ISM) in starburst galaxies contains plenty of chemical elements synthesised by core-collapse supernova explosions. By measuring the abundances of these metals, we can study the chemical enrichment within galaxies and the transportation of metals into circumgalactic environments through powerful outflows. We perform the spectral analysis of the X-ray emissions from the M82 core using the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) onboard XMM-Newton to accurately estimate the metal abundances in the ISM. We analyse over 300 ks of RGS data observed with fourteen position angles, covering an 80 arcsec cross-dispersion width. We employ multi-temperature thermal plasma components in collisional ionisation equilibrium (CIE) to reproduce the observed spectra, each exhibiting different spatial broadenings. The O vii band CCD image shows a broader distribution compared to those for O viii and Fe-L bands. The O viii line profiles have a prominent double-peaked structure, corresponding to the northward and southward outflows. The O vii triplet feature exhibits marginal peaks, and a single CIE component, convolved with the O vii band image, approximately reproduces the spectral shape. Combining a CIE model with a charge-exchange emission model also successfully reproduces the O vii line profiles. However, the ratio of these two components varies significantly with the observed position angles, which is physically implausible. Spectral fitting of the broadband spectra suggests a multi-temperature phase in the ISM, approximated by three components at 0.1, 0.4, and 0.7 keV. Notably, the 0.1 keV component exhibits a broader distribution than the 0.4 and 0.7 keV plasmas. The derived abundance pattern shows super-solar N/O, solar Ne/O and Mg/O, and half-solar Fe/O ratios. These results indicate the chemical enrichments by core-collapse supernovae in starburst galaxies.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>Measurement of anisotropies in Supernova Remnant observations and their interpretation using numerical models</strong>, Soham Mandal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12264v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.12264v1</a></p>

<p>Supernova remnants (SNRs) exhibit varying degrees of anisotropy, which have been extensively modeled using numerical methods. We implement a technique to measure anisotropies in SNRs by calculating power spectra from their high-resolution images. To test this technique, we develop 3D hydrodynamical models of supernova remnants and generate synthetic x-ray images from them. Power spectra extracted from both the 3D models and the synthetic images exhibit the same dominant angular scale, which separates large scale features from small scale features due to hydrodynamic instabilities. The angular power spectrum at small length scales during relatively early times is too steep to be consistent with Kolmogorov turbulence, but it transitions to Kolmogorov turbulence at late times. As an example of how this technique can be applied to observations, we extract a power spectrum from a \textit{Chandra} observation of Tycho’s SNR and compare with our models. Our predicted power spectrum picks out the angular scale of Tycho’s fleece-like structures and also agrees with the small-scale power seen in Tycho. We use this to extract an estimate for the density of the circumstellar gas ($n \sim 0.28/\mathrm{cm^3}$), consistent with previous measurements of this density by other means. The power spectrum also provides an estimate of the density profile of the outermost ejecta. Moreover, we observe additional power at large scales which may provide important clues about the explosion mechanism itself.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>Anomaly Induced Supernovae Cooling: New Contribution from Axions</strong>, Sabyasachi Chakraborty et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12169v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.12169v1</a></p>

<p>Compact stellar objects like supernovae and neutron stars are believed to cool by emitting axions predominantly via axion bremsstrahlung ($NN \to NNa$), pion conversion ($\pi^- p^+ \to N a$) and photo-production ($\gamma N \to N a$). In this $\textit{letter}$, we study a previously overlooked contribution to the photo-production channel, originating from the $\textit{unavoidable}$ anomaly-induced Wess-Zumino-Witten term $\propto \epsilon^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}\, F_{\mu \nu}\, \partial_\alpha a \, \omega_\beta$. As a result, supernovae can cool up to three times faster than what was previously thought, translating into stronger bounds on the axion decay constant. Furthermore, the spectrum of axions emitted in the process is $\textit unique$ as it is significantly harder than those originating from bremsstrahlung. As a consequence, we find that these axions are more likely to show up in near future water Cherenkov detectors as compared to traditional ones.</p>

<p>Stellar multiplicity is among the oldest and richest problems in astrophysics. Binary stars are a cornerstone of stellar mass and radius measurements that underpin modern stellar evolutionary models. Binaries are the progenitors of many of the most interesting and exotic astrophysical phenomena, ranging from type Ia supernovae to gamma ray bursts, hypervelocity stars, and most detectable stellar black holes. They are also ubiquitous, accounting for about half of all stars in the Universe. In the era of gravitational waves, wide-field surveys, and open-source stellar models, binaries are coming back stronger than a nineties trend. Much of the progress in the last decade has been enabled by the Gaia mission, which provides high-precision astrometry for more than a billion stars in the Milky Way. The Gaia data probe a wider range of binary separations and mass ratios than most previous surveys, enabling both an improved binary population census and discovery of rare objects. I summarize recent results in the study of binary stars brought about by Gaia, focusing in particular on developments related to wide ($a \gtrsim 100$ au) binaries, evidence of binarity from astrometric noise and proper motion anomaly, astrometric and radial velocity orbits from Gaia DR3, and binaries containing non-accreting compact objects. Limitations of the Gaia data, the importance of ground-based follow-up, and anticipated improvements with Gaia DR4 are also discussed.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>Evolution and distribution of superbubbles in simulated Milky Way-like galaxies</strong>, Chengzhe Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12135v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.12135v1</a></p>

<p>Stellar feedback plays a crucial role in regulating baryon cycles of a galactic ecosystem, and may manifest itself in the formation of superbubbles in the interstellar medium. In this work, we used a set of high-resolution simulations to systematically study the properties and evolution of superbubbles in galactic environments. The simulations were based on the SMUGGLE galaxy formation framework using the hydrodynamical moving-mesh code Arepo, reaching a spatial resolution of $\sim 4 \, \rm pc$ and mass resolution of $\sim 10^3 \, \rm M_{\odot}$. We identified superbubbles and tracked their time evolution using the parent stellar associations within the bubbles. The X-ray luminosity-size distribution of superbubbles in the fiducial run is largely consistent with the observations of nearby galaxies. The size of superbubbles shows a double-peaked distribution, with the peaks attributed to early feedback (radiative and stellar wind feedback) and supernova feedback. The early feedback tends to suppress the subsequent supernova feedback, and it is strongly influenced by star formation efficiency, which regulates the environmental density. Our results show that the volume filling factor of hot gas ($T &gt; 10^{5.5} ~\mathrm{K}$) is about $12 \%$ averaged over a region of 4 kpc in height and 20 kpc in radius centered on the disk of the galaxy. Overall, the properties of superbubbles are sensitive to the choice of subgrid galaxy formation models and can, therefore, be used to constrain these models.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>Abundance stratification in type Ia supernovae – VII. The peculiar, C-rich iPTF16abc: highlighting diversity among luminous events</strong>, Charles J. Aouad et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12043v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.12043v1</a></p>

<p>Observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe\,Ia) reveal diversity, even within assumed subcategories. Here, the composition of the peculiar iPTF16abc (SN\,2016bln) is derived by modeling a time series of optical spectra. iPTF16abc’s early spectra combine traits of SNe 1999aa and 1991T known for weak \SiII\ $\lambda$ 6355 and prominent \FeIII\ features. However, it differs with weak early \FeIII\ lines, and persistent \CII\ lines post-peak. It also exhibits a weak \CaII\ H\&amp;K feature aligning it with SN\,1991T, an observation supported by their bolometric light curves. The early attenuation of \FeIII\ results from abundance effect. The weakening of the \SiII\ $\lambda$ 6355 line, stems from silicon depletion in the outer shells, a characteristic shared by both SNe 1999aa and 1991T, indicating a common explosion mechanism that terminates nuclear burning at around 12000 \kms\, unseen in normal events. Beneath a thin layer of intermediate mass elements (IMEs) with a total mass of 0.18 \Msun, extends a \Nifs\ rich shell totaling 0.76 \Msun\ and generating a bolometric luminosity as high as ${L_{\mathrm{peak}}}=1.60 \pm 0.1 \times$ $10^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Inner layers, typical of SNe\,Ia, hold neutron-rich elements, (\Feff\ and \Nife), totaling 0.20 M${\odot}$. Stable iron, exceeding solar abundance, and carbon, coexist in the outermost layers, challenging existing explosion models. The presence of carbon down to $v\approx$ 9000\,\kms, totalling $\sim$ 0.01 \Msun\, unprecedented in this class, links iPTF16abc to SN\,2003fg-like events. The retention of 91T-like traits in iPTF16abc underscores its importance in understanding the diversity of SNe\,Ia.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>Revisiting the effect of lens mass models in cosmological applications of strong gravitational lensing</strong>, Christopher Harvey-Hawes et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11997v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.11997v1</a></p>

<p>Strong gravitational lens system catalogues are typically used to constrain a combination of cosmological and empirical lens mass model parameters, even though the simplest singular isothermal sphere (SIS) models yield a $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom $\simeq 2$. To date, this problem has been alleviated by introducing additional empirical parameters in the extended power law (EPL) models and constraints from high resolution imagery. The EPL parameters are taken to vary from lens to lens, rather than defining universal lens profiles. We investigate these lens models using Bayesian methods through a novel alternative that treats spatial curvature via the non-FLRW Timescape cosmology. We apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods using the catalogue of 161 lens systems of Chen et al (arXiv:1809.09845) to simulate large mock catalogues for: (i) the standard $\Lambda$CDM model with zero spatial curvature; and (ii) the Timescape model. Furthermore, this methodology can be applied to any cosmological model. In agreement with previous results we find that in combination with SIS parameters, models with zero FLRW spatial curvature fit better as the free parameter approaches an unphysical empty universe, $\Omega_{\rm M0}\to0$. By contrast, the Timescape cosmology is found to prefer parameter values in which its cosmological parameter, the present void fraction, is driven to $f_{\rm v0}\to0.73$ matches, close to values found to best fit independent cosmological data sets: supernovae Ia distances and cosmic microwave background. This conclusion holds for a large range of seed values $f_{\rm v0}\to0.73\in{0.1,0.9}$, and for Timescape fits to both Timescape and FLRW mocks. Regardless of cosmology, unphysical estimates of the distance ratios given from power-law lens models result in poor goodness of fit. Nonetheless, the results are consistent with non-FLRW spatial curvature evolution.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>Typing supernova remnant G352.7$-$0.1 using XMM-Newton X-ray observations</strong>, Ling-Xiao Dang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11972v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.11972v1</a></p>

<p>G352.7$-$0.1 is a mixed-morphology (MM) supernova remnant (SNR) with multiple radio arcs and has a disputed supernova origin. We conducted a spatially resolved spectroscopic study of the remnant with XMM-Newton X-ray data to investigate its explosion mechanism and explain its morphology. The global X-ray spectra of the SNR can be adequately reproduced using a metal-rich thermal plasma model with a temperature of $\sim 2$ keV and ionization timescale of $\sim 3\times 10^{10}~{\rm cm^{-3}~s}$. Through a comparison with various supernova nucleosynthesis models, we found that observed metal properties from Mg to Fe can be better described using core-collapse supernova models, while thermonuclear models fail to explain the observed high Mg/Si ratio. The best-fit supernova model suggests a $\sim 13$ $M_\odot$ progenitor star, consistent with previous estimates using the wind bubble size. We also discussed the possible mechanisms that may lead to SNR G352.7$-$0.1 being an MMSNR. By dividing the SNR into several regions, we found that the temperature and abundance do not significantly vary with regions, except for a decreased temperature and abundance in a region interacting with molecular clouds. The brightest X-ray emission of the SNR spatially matches with the inner radio structure, suggesting that the centrally filled X-ray morphology results from a projection effect.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>Sound Horizon Independent Constraints on Early Dark Energy: The Role of Supernova Data</strong>, Joshua A. Kable et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11916v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.11916v1</a></p>

<p>We assess the consistency of cosmological models that alter the size of the sound horizon at last scattering to resolve the Hubble tension with data from ACT + Planck CMB lensing, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, and supernova data from Pantheon or Pantheon+. We use early dark energy (EDE) as an example model but conclude that the results apply to other similar models. We constrain $\Lambda$CDM and EDE with these data finding that while they can constrain $\Lambda$CDM very tightly, EDE opens up the parameter space significantly and allows $H_0 &gt; 72$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We combine these data with measurements from ACT + Planck TT650TEEE CMB primary anisotropy and galaxy baryon acoustic oscillations, and find that overall, EDE fits these data better than $\Lambda$CDM at $\approx 2\sigma$. However, the fit to specifically the sound-horizon-independent measurements is worse for EDE than $\Lambda$CDM. We assess this increase in $\chi^2$ coming from the sound-horizon-independent measurements and find that the best-fit model is still consistent with a random statistical fluctuation even with $H_0$ values around $72$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We conclude that these specific sound-horizon-independent data cannot rule out the possibility of a miscalibration of the size of the sound horizon, but leave open the possibility that other current or future sound-horizon-independent data sets could rule out such a miscalibration.</p>

<p>2024-03-18, <strong>Narrow absorption lines from intervening material in supernovae I. Measurements and temporal evolution</strong>, Santiago González-Gaitán et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11677v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.11677v1</a></p>

<p>Narrow absorption features in nearby supernova (SN) spectra are a powerful diagnostic of the slow-moving material in the line of sight: they are extensively used to infer dust extinction from the host galaxies, and they can also serve in the detection of circumstellar material originating from the SN progenitor and present in the vicinity of the explosion. Despite their wide use, very few studies have examined the biases of the methods to characterize narrow lines, and not many statistical analyses exist. This is the first paper of a series in which we present a statistical analysis of narrow lines of SN spectra of various resolutions. We develop a robust automated methodology to measure the equivalent width (EW) and velocity of narrow absorption lines from intervening material in the line of sight of SNe, including Na I D , Ca II H&amp;K, K i and diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs). We carefully study systematic biases in heterogeneous spectra from the literature by simulating different signal-to-noise, spectral resolution, slit size and orientation and present the real capabilities and limitations of using low- and mid-resolution spectra to study these lines. In particular, we find that the measurement of the equivalent width of the narrow lines in low-resolution spectra is highly affected by the evolving broad P-Cygni profiles of the SN ejecta, both for core-collapse and type Ia SNe, inducing a conspicuous apparent evolution. We present thus an easy way to detect and exclude those cases to obtain more robust and reliable measurements. Finally, after considering all possible effects, we analyse the temporal evolution of the narrow features in a large sample of nearby SNe to detect any possible variation in their EWs over time. We find no time evolution of the narrow line features in our large sample for all SN types</p>
