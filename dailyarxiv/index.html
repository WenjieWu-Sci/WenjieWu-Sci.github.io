<p>2024-06-12, <strong>Reactor Antineutrino Directionality Measurement with the PROSPECT-I Detector</strong>, M. Andriamirado et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08359v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.08359v1</a></p>

<p>The PROSPECT-I detector has several features that enable measurement of the direction of a compact neutrino source. In this paper, a detailed report on the directional measurements made on electron antineutrinos emitted from the High Flux Isotope Reactor is presented. With an estimated true neutrino (reactor to detector) direction of $\phi = 40.8\unicode{xB0} \pm 0.7\unicode{xB0}$ and $\theta = 98.6\unicode{xB0} \pm 0.4\unicode{xB0}$, the PROSPECT-I detector is able to reconstruct an average neutrino direction of $\phi = 39.4\unicode{xB0} \pm 2.9\unicode{xB0}$ and $\theta = 97.6\unicode{xB0} \pm 1.6\unicode{xB0}$. This measurement is made with approximately 48000 Inverse Beta Decay signal events and is the most precise directional reconstruction of reactor antineutrinos to date.</p>

<p>We developed a modular silicon photomultiplier camera to detect Earth-skimming PeV to EeV tau neutrinos with the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique. We built two cameras, a 256-pixel camera with S14161-6050HS SiPMs for the Trinity Demonstrator located on Frisco Peak, Utah, and a 512-pixel camera with S14521-6050AN SiPMs for the EUSO-SPB2 Cherenkov Telescope. The front-end electronics are based on the eMUSIC ASIC, and the camera signals are sampled and digitized with the 100MS/s and 12-bit AGET system. Both cameras are liquid-cooled. We detail the camera concept and the results from characterizing the SiPMs, bench testing, and calibrating the two cameras.</p>

<p>2024-06-12, <strong>Weak interaction axial form factors of the octet baryons in nuclear medium</strong>, G. Ramalho et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07958v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07958v1</a></p>

<p>We study the axial-vector and the induced pseudoscalar form factors associated with the weak transitions between the octet baryon members in nuclear medium, using a covariant constituent quark model. We extend previous calculations of the axial transition form factors from the vacuum (free space) to the nuclear medium (symmetric nuclear matter). The extension of the model to the nuclear medium takes into account the modifications of the properties of hadrons in the medium (masses and coupling constants), as determined by the quark-meson coupling model. The axial-vector ($G_A$) and the induced pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factors are evaluated for different values of the nuclear density $\rho$ in terms of the square transfer momentum $q^2= -Q^2$. We conclude that in general the $G_A$ and $G_P$ form factors are reduced in the nuclear medium. The reduction is stronger for light baryons and high densities. The medium modifications are milder for the heavier octet baryons, particularly at large $Q^2$. The calculations presented here can be used to estimate the cross sections of neutrino and antineutrino scattering with nucleus, and neutrino and antineutrino scattering with hyperons bound to a nucleus, as well as those in the cores of compact stars.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>A 17 MeV pseudoscalar and the LSND, MiniBooNE and ATOMKI anomalies</strong>, Waleed Abdallah et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07643v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07643v1</a></p>

<p>In the absence of any new physics signals at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), anomalous results at low energy experiments have become the subject of increased attention and scrutiny. We focus on three such results from the LSND, MiniBooNE (MB), and ATOMKI experiments. A 17 MeV pseudoscalar mediator ($aâ$) can account for the excess events seen in $^8$Be and $^4$He pair creation transitions in ATOMKI. We incorporate this mediator in a gauge invariant extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a second Higgs doublet and three singlet (seesaw) neutrinos ($N_i, i=1,2,3$). $N_{1,2}$ participate in an interaction in MB and LSND which, with $aâ$ as mediator, leads to the production of $e^+ e^-$ pairs. The $N_i$ also lead to mass-squared differences for SM neutrinos in agreement with global oscillation data. We first show that such a model offers a clean and natural joint solution to the MB and LSND excesses. We then examine the possibility of a common solution to all three anomalies. Using the values of the couplings to the quarks and electrons which are required to explain pair creation nuclear transition data for $^8$Be and $^4$He in ATOMKI, we show that these values lead to excellent fits for MB and LSND data as well, allowing for a common solution. We obtain a representative solution space for this, in the context of an important constraint that comes from the decay $K^+ \rightarrow \pi^+ aâ \, (aâ\rightarrow e^+e^-$). We also discuss other constraints on the model from both collider and non-collider experiments as well as those from electroweak precision data, stability and unitarity. We compute the contributions to the electron and muon $g-2$ up to two loops for our model and discuss the results in the context of the current theoretical and empirical scenario vis a vis these parameters. Finally, we discuss future tests of the model in upcoming experiments.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>IceCube Search for Neutrino Emission from X-ray Bright Seyfert Galaxies</strong>, R. Abbasi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07601v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07601v1</a></p>

<p>The recent IceCube detection of TeV neutrino emission from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068 suggests that active galactic nuclei (AGN) could make a sizable contribution to the diffuse flux of astrophysical neutrinos. The absence of TeV $\gamma$-rays from NGC 1068 indicates neutrino production in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole, where the high radiation density leads to $\gamma$-ray attenuation. Therefore, any potential neutrino emission from similar sources is not expected to correlate with high-energy $\gamma$-rays. Disk-corona models predict neutrino emission from Seyfert galaxies to correlate with keV X-rays, as they are tracers of coronal activity. Using through-going track events from the Northern Sky recorded by IceCube between 2011 and 2021, we report results from a search for individual and aggregated neutrino signals from 27 additional Seyfert galaxies that are contained in the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS). Besides the generic single power-law, we evaluate the spectra predicted by the disk-corona model. Assuming all sources to be intrinsically similar to NGC 1068, our findings constrain the collective neutrino emission from X-ray bright Seyfert galaxies in the Northern Hemisphere, but, at the same time, show excesses of neutrinos that could be associated with the objects NGC 4151 and CGCG 420-015. These excesses result in a 2.7$\sigma$ significance with respect to background expectations.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>Scintillation Light in SBND: Simulation, Reconstruction, and Expected Performance of the Photon Detection System</strong>, SBND Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07514v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07514v1</a></p>

<p>SBND is the near detector of the Short-Baseline Neutrino program at Fermilab. Its location near to the Booster Neutrino Beam source and relatively large mass will allow the study of neutrino interactions on argon with unprecedented statistics. This paper describes the expected performance of the SBND photon detection system, using a simulated sample of beam neutrinos and cosmogenic particles. Its design is a dual readout concept combining a system of 120 photomultiplier tubes, used for triggering, with a system of 192 X-ARAPUCA devices, located behind the anode wire planes. Furthermore, covering the cathode plane with highly-reflective panels coated with a wavelength-shifting compound recovers part of the light emitted towards the cathode, where no optical detectors exist. We show how this new design provides a high light yield and a more uniform detection efficiency, an excellent timing resolution and an independent 3D-position reconstruction using only the scintillation light. Finally, the whole reconstruction chain is applied to recover the temporal structure of the beam spill, which is resolved with a resolution on the order of nanoseconds.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>Spread Complexity of High Energy Neutrino Propagation over Astrophysical Distances</strong>, Khushboo Dixit et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07491v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07491v1</a></p>

<p>Spread complexity measures the minimized spread of quantum states over all choices of basis. It generalizes Krylov operator complexity to quantum states under continuous Hamiltonian evolution. In this paper, we study spread complexity in the context of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and propose a new flavor ratio based on complexity. Our findings indicate that our proposal might favor an initial ratio of fluxes as $\phi_{\nu_e}^0: \phi_{\nu_\mu}^0: \phi_{\nu_\tau}^0 = 1:0:0$ over a more generally expected ratio of $1:2:0$, when the IceCube neutrino observatory achieves its projected sensitivity to discriminate between flavors. Additionally, complexity-based definitions of flavor ratios exhibit a slight but nonzero sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering, which traditional flavor ratios cannot capture.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>Neutrino magnetic dipole portal with low energy neutrino nucleus scattering data</strong>, Ying-Ying Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07477v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07477v1</a></p>

<p>Sterile neutrinos that couple to the Standard Model via the neutrino magnetic dipole portals have been extensively studied at various experiments. In this work, we scrutinize these interactions for sterile neutrinos in the mass range of $\unit[0.1]{}-\unit[50]{MeV}$ through the nuclear and electron recoils at various neutrino scattering experiments. For the $e$-flavor specific dipole portal, we demonstrate that Dresden-II can provide leading constraints for $m_N \lesssim \unit[0.5]{MeV}$, setting aside currently unresolved theoretical uncertainties. For the $\mu$-flavor case, we show that the COHERENT experiment can probe a unique parameter region for $m_N$ in the range of $\unit[10]{}-\unit[40]{MeV}$ with the full dataset collected by the CsI[Na] scintillation detector, including both the energy and timing structure of the neutrino beam. We also present limits on the parameter regions of the $\tau$-flavor dipole portal using measurements of the solar neutrino flux from dark matter direct detection experiments.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>Multimessenger constraints for electrophilic feebly interacting particles from supernovae</strong>, Pedro De la Torre Luque et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07316v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07316v1</a></p>

<p>Several extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of sub-GeV particles that can be copiously produced in the cores of supernovae. A broad family of these particles are dubbed feebly interacting particles (FIPs), which can have masses of up to a few hundreds of MeV. Here, we review the most recent and leading constraints on electrophilic FIPs, describing multimessenger techniques that allow us to probe the full phenomenology of the electron/positron emission produced by these FIPs; from their associated X-ray emission to the production of the $511$~keV line. Furthermore, the approach described here is independent of the specific particle model and can be translated to the coupling and other properties of a variety of different particles, such as axion-like particles, sterile neutrinos or dark photons</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>The New Worlds Simulations: Large-scale Simulations across Three Cosmologies</strong>, Katrin Heitmann et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07276v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07276v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper we describe the set of ``New Worlds Simulationsââ, three very large cosmology simulations, QoânoS, Vulcan, and Ferenginar, that were carried out on the Summit supercomputer with the Hardware/Hybrid Cosmology Code, HACC. The gravity-only simulations follow the evolution of structure in the Universe by each employing 12,288^3 particles in (3 Gpc/h)^3 volumes, leading to a mass resolution of m_p~10^9 Msun/h. The simulations cover three different cosmologies, one LambdaCDM model, consistent with measurements from Planck, one simulation with massive neutrinos, and one simulation with a varying dark energy equation of state. All simulations have the same phases to allow a detailed comparison of the results and the investigation of the impact of different cosmological parameters. We present measurements of some basic statistics, such as matter power spectra, correlation function, halo mass function and concentration-mass relation and investigate the differences due to the varying cosmologies. Given the large volume and high resolution, these simulations provide excellent bases for creating synthetic skies. A subset of the data is made publicly available as part of this paper.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>Superscaling analysis of inclusive electron and (anti)neutrino scattering within the coherent density fluctuation model</strong>, M. V. Ivanov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07190v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07190v1</a></p>

<p>The experimental data from quasielastic electron and (anti)neutrino scattering on $^{12}$C are reanalyzed in terms of a new scaling variable $\psi^<em>$ suggested by the interacting relativistic Fermi gas with scalar and vector interactions, which is known to generate a relativistic effective mass for the interacting nucleons. We construct a new scaling function $f^\text{QE}(\psi^</em>)$ for the inclusive lepton scattering from nuclei within the coherent density fluctuation model (CDFM). The latter is a natural extension of the relativistic Fermi gas model to finite nuclei. In this work, on the basis of the scaling function obtained within CDFM with a relativistic effective mass $m_N^* =0.8 m_N$, we calculate and compare the theoretical predictions with a large set of experimental data for inclusive ($e,eâ$) and (anti)neutrino cross sections. The model also includes the contribution of weak two-body currents in the two-particle two-hole sector, evaluated within a fully relativistic Fermi gas. Good agreement with experimental data is found over the whole range of electron and (anti)neutrino energies.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>On Lepton and Baryon Numbers as Local Gauge Symmetries</strong>, Pavel Fileviez Perez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06866v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.06866v1</a></p>

<p>A simple theory where the total lepton number is a local gauge symmetry is proposed. In this context, the gauge anomalies are cancelled with the minimal number of extra fermionic fields and one predicts that the neutrinos are Majorana fermions. The properties of the neutrino sector are discussed showing that this theory predicts a $3+2$ light neutrino sector. We show that using the same fermionic fields one can gauge the baryon number and define a simple theory where the lepton and baryon numbers can be spontaneously broken at the low scale in agreement with experiments.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>Exploring flavour space of an economical SU(5) GUT in future proton decay measurements</strong>, Gao-Xiang Fang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06861v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.06861v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the potential of future proton decay experiments on the exploration of the flavour space of grand unification. We focus on an economical SU(5) grand unified model (GUT) with the fermion sector extended by including only one copy of 24-plet. Neutrino masses are generated via type-(I+III) seesaw mechanism with the lightest neutrino massless. Gauge unification requires masses of fermions in the 24-plet to be hierarchical, in particular, the electroweak singlet and triplet heavy leptons to be around the canonical seesaw scale and TeV scale, respectively. We address how extra parameters in the flavour space which cannot be touched in flavour measurements can be tested by a multi-channel analysis in future proton decay measurements.</p>

<p>2024-06-12, <strong>Enhancing Cosmological Model Selection with Interpretable Machine Learning</strong>, Indira Ocampo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08351v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.08351v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a novel approach using neural networks (NNs) to differentiate between cosmological models, especially in the case where they are nested and the additional model parameters are close to zero, making it difficult to discriminate them with traditional approaches. Our method complements Bayesian analyses for cosmological model selection, which heavily depend on the chosen priors and average the unnormalized posterior over potentially large prior volumes. By analyzing simulated realistic data sets of the growth rate of the large scale structure (LSS) of the Universe, based on current galaxy-clustering survey specifications, for the cosmological constant and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model, we demonstrate the potential of NNs to enhance the extraction of meaningful information from cosmological LSS data. We find that the NN can successfully distinguish between $\Lambda$CDM and the $f(R)$ models, by predicting the correct model with approximately $97\%$ overall accuracy, thus demonstrating that NNs can maximise the potential of current and next generation surveys to probe for deviations from general relativity.</p>

<p>2024-06-12, <strong>Dark matter in the Milky Way: Measurements up to 3 kpc from the Galactic plane above Sunâs location</strong>, O. BienaymÃ© et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08158v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.08158v1</a></p>

<p>We are probing the gravitational force perpendicular to the Galactic plane at the position of the Sun with a sample of red giants whose measurements are taken from the DR3-Gaia catalogue. Measurements far out of the Galactic plane up to 3.5 kpc allow us to determine directly the total mass density where dark matter is dominant, while stellar and gas densities are very low. In a complementary way, we are also using a new determination of the local baryonic mass density to help us determine the density of dark matter in the Galactic plane at the solar position. We obtain for the local mass density of dark matter $\rho_\mathrm{dm}$=0.0128$\pm $0.0008 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-3}$ = 0.486 $\pm$0.030 Gev cm$^{-3}$, for the flattening of the gravitational potential of the dark halo $q_\mathrm{\phi,h}$=0.843$\pm0.035$, and for its density $q_\mathrm{\rho,h}$=0.781$\pm$0.055.</p>

<p>2024-06-12, <strong>Collinear three-photon excitation of a strongly forbidden optical clock transition</strong>, Samuel P. Carman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07902v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07902v1</a></p>

<p>The ${}^1!S_0-{}^3!P_0$ clock transition in strontium serves as the foundation for the worldâs best atomic clocks and for gravitational wave detector concepts in clock atom interferometry. This transition is weakly allowed in the fermionic isotope $^{87}$Sr, but strongly forbidden in bosonic isotopes unless a strong external magnetic field is applied. Here we demonstrate coherent excitation of the clock transition in bosonic ${}^{88}$Sr using a novel collinear three-photon process in a weak magnetic field. We observe Rabi oscillations with frequencies of up to $50~\text{kHz}$ using $\text{W}/\text{cm}^{2}$ laser intensities and Gauss-level magnetic field amplitudes. The absence of nuclear spin in bosonic isotopes offers decreased sensitivity to magnetic fields and optical lattice light shifts, enabling clocks with reduced systematic errors. The collinear propagation of the laser fields permits the interrogation of spatially separated atomic ensembles with common laser pulses, a key requirement for dark matter searches and gravitational wave detection with clock atom interferometers.</p>

<p>2024-06-12, <strong>Wideband tunable cavity development for axion dark matter searches using a piezoelectric motor in combination with gears</strong>, A. K. Yi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07782v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07782v1</a></p>

<p>Most search experiments sensitive to quantum chromodynamics axion dark matter benefit from microwave cavities, as electromagnetic resonators, that enhance the detected axion signal power and thus the experimental sensitivity drastically. As the possible axion mass spans multiple orders of magnitude, microwave cavities must be tunable and it is desirable for the cavity to have a tunable frequency range that is as wide as possible. Since the tunable frequency range generally increases as the dimension of the conductor tuning rod increases for a given cylindrical conductor cavity system, we developed a cavity system with a large dimensional tuning rod in order to increase this. We, for the first time, employed not only a piezoelectric motor, but also gears to drive a large and accordingly heavy tuning rod, where such a combination to increase driving power can be adopted for extreme environments as is the case for axion dark matter experiments: cryogenic, high-magnetic-field, and high vacuum. Thanks to such higher power derived from the piezoelectric motor and gear combination, we realized a wideband tunable cavity whose frequency range is about 42\% of the central resonant frequency of the cavity, without sacrificing the experimental sensitivity too much.</p>

<p>We present the idea that replacing the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model by a distribution of walls, with very low tension compared to what one would expect from new physics, could help explaining the tension in the Hubble constant fits in the Standard Cosmological Model. Using parameters from our model for dark matter as macroscopic pearls, we can get a promising order of magnitude for the correction to the Hubble constant estimated from observations of the cosmic microwave background. Our model is on the borderline of failing by predicting too large extra fluctuations as a function of direction in the cosmological microwave background radiation. However, imagining the bubbles in the voids to have come from more somewhat smaller big bubbles also occurring outside the big voids may help. We estimate that, in order to have big volumes of the new vacuum in intergalactic space, a very high temperature is needed and that such regions would be likely to get cooled, freeze and shrink down to the degenerate form of dark matter if hitting some ordinary matter, as is likely in the denser parts of the Universe. We also review our model for dark matter, and develop the understanding of the stopping of the dark matter particles in the shielding of say the DAMA-LIBRA underground experiment and the counting rate this experiment observes. We manage to obtain a consistent fit with a mass $M = 2 \cdot 10^{-18}$kg = $10^9$GeV and radius $R = 10^{-10}$m for the dark matter pearls, corresponding to a tension in the domain wall of $S= (8 {\rm MeV})^3$.</p>

<p>In the paper, we consider the processes of single top quark production in association with dark matter particles through the t-channel in simplified models with scalar and pseudoscalar mediators. Within the framework of these models, we analyze the spin correlations that arise in the top quark production process in association with dark matter, comparing them with the production of a top quark in the Standard Model. We consider angular correlations of kinematic variables, which define admissible regions in momentum space and can be used experimentally to distinguish between the fraction of the total momentum carried away by the scalar or pseudoscalar mediator.</p>

<p>Recent observations of three nearby black hole low-mass X-ray binaries have suggested possible evidence of dark matter density spikes. It has long been established that cold dark matter should form dense spikes around intermediate-mass and supermassive black holes due to adiabatic compression of the surrounding dark matter halo. Lighter black holes formed from stellar collapse, however, are not expected to develop such spikes, and so it is unclear how the stellar-mass black holes in these binaries could have acquired such features. Given that primordial black holes are expected to form ultra-dense dark matter mini-spikes, in this Letter we explore the possibility that these stellar-mass black holes may actually have a primordial origin.</p>

<p>Supercooled first-order phase transition (FOPT) can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). This scenario imposes stringent requirements on the profile of the effective potential. In this work, we use the singlet extended Standard Model (xSM) as a benchmark model to investigate this possibility at the electroweak scale. The PBHs formed during a supercooled FOPT have a narrow mass distribution around the mass of Earth. This distribution is closely tied to the temperature at which the PBHs form, corresponding to the FOPT at the electroweak scale. This scenario can be probed with microlensing experiments, space-based gravitational wave detectors, and collider experiments. Remarkably, the future space-based gravitational wave detector LISA will hold the potential to either confirm this PBH scenario in the xSM or completely rule it out for extremely small total dark matter fraction made of PBHs, down to $f_{\rm PBH}&gt; 10^{-300}$. Interestingly, our findings suggest that PBHs within the xSM framework may align with observations of the six ultrashort timescale events reported by the OGLE microlensing experiment.</p>

<p>In a hierarchical, dark matter-dominated Universe, stellar mass functions (SMFs), galaxy merger rates, star formation histories (SFHs), satellite abundances, and intracluster light, should all be intimately connected observables. However, the systematics affecting observations still prevent universal and uniform measurements of, for example, the SMF and the SFHs, inevitably preventing theoretical models to compare with multiple data sets robustly and simultaneously. We here present our holistic semi-empirical model DECODE (Discrete statistical sEmi-empiriCal mODEl) that converts via abundance matching dark matter merger trees into galaxy assembly histories, using different SMFs in input and predicting all other observables in output in a fully data-driven and self-consistent fashion with minimal assumptions. We find that: 1) weakly evolving or nearly constant SMFs below the knee ($M_\star \lesssim 10^{11} \, M_\odot$) are the best suited to generate star formation histories aligned with those inferred from MaNGA, SDSS, GAMA, and, more recently, JWST; 2) the evolution of satellites after infall only affects the satellite abundances and star formation histories of massive central galaxies but not their merger histories; 3) the resulting SFR-$M_\star$ relation is lower in normalization by a factor of $\sim 2$ with respect to observations, with a flattening at high masses more pronounced in the presence of mergers; 4) the latest data on intracluster light can be reproduced if mass loss from mergers is included in the models. Our findings are pivotal in acting as pathfinder to test the self-consistency of the high-quality data from, e.g., JWST and Euclid.</p>

<p>Deep learning-based object detection algorithms enable the simultaneous classification and localization of any number of objects in image data. Many of these algorithms are capable of operating in real-time on high resolution images, attributing to their widespread usage across many fields. We present an end-to-end object detection pipeline designed for real-time rare event searches for the Migdal effect, using high-resolution image data from a state-of-the-art scientific CMOS camera in the MIGDAL experiment. The Migdal effect in nuclear scattering, crucial for sub-GeV dark matter searches, has yet to be experimentally confirmed, making its detection a primary goal of the MIGDAL experiment. Our pipeline employs the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm and is trained on real data to enhance the detection efficiency of nuclear and electronic recoils, particularly those exhibiting overlapping tracks that are indicative of the Migdal effect. When deployed online on the MIGDAL readout PC, we demonstrate our pipeline to process and perform the rare event search on 2D image data faster than the peak 120 frame per second acquisition rate of the CMOS camera. Applying these same steps offline, we demonstrate that we can reduce a sample of 20 million camera frames to around 1000 frames while maintaining nearly all signal that YOLOv8 is able to detect, thereby transforming a rare search into a much more manageable search. Our studies highlight the potential of pipelines similar to ours significantly improving the detection capabilities of experiments requiring rapid and precise object identification in high-throughput data environments.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>COMAP Pathfinder â Season 2 results III. Implications for cosmic molecular gas content at âCosmic Half-past Elevenâ</strong>, D. T. Chung et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07512v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07512v1</a></p>

<p>The Carbon monOxide Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder survey continues to demonstrate the feasibility of line-intensity mapping using high-redshift carbon monoxide (CO) line emission traced at cosmological scales. The latest COMAP Pathfinder power spectrum analysis is based on observations through the end of Season 2, covering the first three years of Pathfinder operations. We use our latest constraints on the CO(1-0) line-intensity power spectrum at $z\sim3$ to update corresponding constraints on the cosmological clustering of CO line emission and thus the cosmic molecular gas content at a key epoch of galaxy assembly. We first mirror the COMAP Early Science interpretation, considering how Season 2 results translate to limits on the shot noise power of CO fluctuations and the bias of CO emission as a tracer of the underlying dark matter distribution. The COMAP Season 2 results place the most stringent limits on the CO tracer bias to date, at $\langle{Tb}\rangle&lt;4.8$ $\mu$K. These limits narrow the model space significantly compared to previous CO line-intensity mapping results while maintaining consistency with small-volume interferometric surveys of resolved line candidates. The results also express a weak preference for CO emission models used to guide fiducial forecasts from COMAP Early Science, including our data-driven priors. We also consider directly constraining a model of the halo-CO connection, and show qualitative hints of capturing the total contribution of faint CO emitters through the improved sensitivity of COMAP data. With continued observations and matching improvements in analysis, the COMAP Pathfinder remains on track for a detection of cosmological clustering of CO emission.</p>

<p>The operation of the next generation of gamma-ray observatories will lead to a great advance in dark matter searches. In this paper, we use the hidden sectors hypothesis within the so-called secluded models to calculate the capabilities of the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) to detect gamma-ray signatures produced by dark matter particles concentrated in the Sun. We assume the dark matter particle annihilates into metastable mediators which decay into $\gamma\gamma$, $e^+e^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, and $\bar{b}b$ outside the Sun. We found that the SWGO will be able to probe a spin-dependent cross-section of about $10^{-46}$ cm$^2$ for dark matter masses smaller than 5 TeV. This result shows an unprecedented sensitivity surpassing the current instruments by more than one order of magnitude.</p>

<p>Because of their extreme densities and consequently, gravitational potential, compact objects such as neutron stars can prove to be excellent captors of dark matter particles. Considering purely gravitational interactions between dark and hadronic matter, we construct dark matter admixed stars composed of two-fluid matter subject to current astrophysical constraints of maximum mass and tidal deformability. We choose a wide range of parameters to construct the dark matter equation of state, and the DDME2 parameterization for the hadronic equation of state. We then examine the effect of dark matter on the stellar structure, tidal deformability and non-radial modes considering the relativistic Cowling approximation. We find the effect on $p$-modes is substantial, with frequencies decreasing up to the typical $f-$mode frequency range for most stars with a dark matter halo. The effects on the $f-$mode frequency are less extreme. Finally, we find the most probable and $1\sigma$ values of the dark matter parameters used in this study.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>Search for photons above 10$^{18}$ eV by simultaneously measuring the atmospheric depth and the muon content of air showers at the Pierre Auger Observatory</strong>, The Pierre Auger Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07439v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07439v1</a></p>

<p>The Pierre Auger Observatory is the most sensitive instrument to detect photons with energies above $10^{17}$ eV. It measures extensive air showers generated by ultra high energy cosmic rays using a hybrid technique that exploits the combination of a fluorescence detector with a ground array of particle detectors. The signatures of a photon-induced air shower are a larger atmospheric depth of the shower maximum ($X_{max}$) and a steeper lateral distribution function, along with a lower number of muons with respect to the bulk of hadron-induced cascades. In this work, a new analysis technique in the energy interval between 1 and 30 EeV (1 EeV = $10^{18}$ eV) has been developed by combining the fluorescence detector-based measurement of $X_{max}$ with the specific features of the surface detector signal through a parameter related to the air shower muon content, derived from the universality of the air shower development. No evidence of a statistically significant signal due to photon primaries was found using data collected in about 12 years of operation. Thus, upper bounds to the integral photon flux have been set using a detailed calculation of the detector exposure, in combination with a data-driven background estimation. The derived 95% confidence level upper limits are 0.0403, 0.01113, 0.0035, 0.0023, and 0.0021 km$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ above 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 EeV, respectively, leading to the most stringent upper limits on the photon flux in the EeV range. Compared with past results, the upper limits were improved by about 40% for the lowest energy threshold and by a factor 3 above 3 EeV, where no candidates were found and the expected background is negligible. The presented limits can be used to probe the assumptions on chemical composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays and allow for the constraint of the mass and lifetime phase space of super-heavy dark matter particles.</p>

<p>(abridged)Scalar field dark matter (SFDM) made of bosons has become a popular alternative to the CDM paradigm, especially for its potential to cure the so-called âsmall-scale problemsâ of CDM. Cosmological simulations have determined that SFDM halos exhibit a core-envelope structure, but they are computationally expensive. Halo cores have been found to be well approximated by âsolitonsâ. The study of single soliton and multiple soliton merger dynamics constitutes a more feasible approach to investigate in detail the genuine quantum dynamics of SFDM and its interplay with self-gravity for a multitude of free boson parameters. In this paper, we present dedicated simulations of single solitons and binary soliton mergers, for models without and with a 2-boson, repulsive, weak to intermediate self-interaction (SI), as well as multiple soliton mergers without SI. We adapt the open-source code Pyultralight to simulate solitons with SI. We derive numerical scaling relations between the central density and mass of solitons for several values of SI and find deviations from the monotonic relations known from fuzzy dark matter (no SI), or the strongly repulsive Thomas-Fermi regime. Solitons with SI exemplify larger cores and lower central densities, compared to solitons without SI. Using our simulations, we extract numerical density profiles for solitons and post-merger objects, and fit them to analytic functions of previous literature. We find a mild preference for Gaussian cores for objects with SI, while the envelopes of post-mergers can be fit to NFW profiles albeit with some caution as we discuss. Similar to previous work, we find global, persistent oscillations for solitons as well as post-mergers, confirming that self-gravitating SFDM has very long relaxation times, although objects with SI exhibit oscillations of comparatively smaller amplitude.</p>

<p>We propose a novel neutron interferometry setup to explore the potential existence of mirror neutrons, a candidate for dark matter. Our work demonstrates that if mirror neutrons exist, neutrons will acquire an observable geometric phase due to mixing with these mirror counterparts. This geometric phase, detectable through our interferometric setup, could serve as a direct probe for the presence of mirror matter particles. Additionally, this investigation could shed light on unresolved issues in particle physics, such as the neutron lifetime puzzle. We discuss the setupâs versatility and limitations, showing its capability to explore a wide range of parameters in neutron interferometry and potentially uncover new physics.</p>

<p>We search for physically consistent realizations of evolving dark energy suggested by the cosmological fit of DESI, Planck and Supernovae data. First we note that any lagrangian description of the standard Chevallier-Linder-Polarski (CLP) parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm eff}$, allows for the addition of a cosmological constant. We perform the cosmological fit finding new regions of parameter space that however continue to favour dark energy with $w_{\rm eff}&lt;-1$ at early times that are challenging to realize in theoretically consistent theories. Next, in the spirit of effective field theories, we consider the effect of higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of the equation of state around the present epoch. We find that non-linear corrections of the equation of state are weakly constrained, thus opening the way to scenarios that differ from CLP at early times, possibly with $w_{\rm eff}&gt;-1$ at all times. We present indeed scenarios where evolving dark energy can be realized through quintessence models. We introduce in particular the ramp model where dark energy coincides with CLP at late times and approximates to a cosmological constant at early times. The latter model provides a much better fit than $\Lambda$CDM, and only slightly worse than $w_0w_a$CDM, but with the big advantage of being described by a simple and theoretically consistent lagrangian of a canonical quintessence model.</p>

<p>We present a systematic search for tidal disruption events (TDEs) using radio data from the Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Pilot Survey conducted using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). Historically, TDEs have been identified using observations at X-ray, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths. After discovery, a few dozen TDEs have been shown to have radio counterparts through follow-up observations. With systematic time-domain radio surveys becoming available, we can now identify new TDEs in the radio regime. A population of radio-discovered TDEs has the potential to provide several key insights including an independent constraint on their volumetric rate. We conducted a search to select variable radio sources with a single prominent radio flare and a position consistent within 2$\sigma$ of the nucleus of a known galaxy. While TDEs were the primary target of our search, sources identified in this search may also be consistent with active galactic nuclei exhibiting unusual flux density changes at the timescales probed, uncharacteristically bright supernovae, or a population of gamma-ray bursts. We identify a sample of 12 radio-bright candidate TDEs. The timescales and luminosities range from ~6 to 230 days and ~10$^{38}$ to 10$^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$, consistent with models of radio emission from TDEs that launch relativistic jets. After calculating the detection efficiency of our search using a Monte Carlo simulation of TDEs, and assuming all 12 sources are jetted TDEs, we derive a volumetric rate for jetted TDEs of 0.80$^{+0.31}_{-0.23}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with previous empirically estimated rates.</p>

<p>We present early-time, hour-to-day cadence spectroscopy of the nearby type II supernova (SN II) 2024ggi, which was discovered at a phase when the SN shock just emerged from the red-supergiant (RSG) progenitor star. Over the first few days after the first light, SN\,2024ggi exhibited prominent narrow emission lines formed through intense and persistent photoionization of the nearby circumstellar material (CSM). In the first 63 hours, spectral lines of He, C, N, and O revealed a rapid rise in ionization, as a result of the progressive sweeping-up of the CSM by the shock. The duration of the IIn-like spectra indicates a dense and relatively confined CSM distribution extending up to $\sim\,4\,\times\,10^{14}$\,cm. Spectral modeling reveals a CSM mass loss rate at this region exceeding $5 \times\, 10^{-3}$\,\Msun\,yr$^{-1}$\,is required to reproduce low-ionization emissions, which dramatically exceeds that of an RSG. Analyzing H$\alpha$ emission shift implies the velocity of the unshocked outer CSM to be between 20 and 40 \kms, matching the typical wind velocity of an RSG. The differences between the inner and outer layers of the CSM and an RSG progenitor highlight a complex mass loss history before the explosion of SN 2024ggi.</p>

<p>The scaling of galaxy properties with halo mass suggests that feedback loops regulate star formation, but there is no consensus yet about how those feedback loops work. To help clarify discussions of galaxy-scale feedback, Paper I presented a very simple model for supernova feedback that it called the minimalist regulator model. This followup paper interprets that model and discusses its implications. The model itself is an accounting system that tracks all of the mass and energy associated with a haloâs circumgalactic baryonsâthe central galaxyâs atmosphere. Algebraic solutions for the equilibrium states of that model reveal that star formation in low-mass halos self-regulates primarily by expanding the atmospheres of those halos, ultimately resulting in stellar masses that are insensitive to the mass-loading properties of galactic winds. What matters most is the proportion of supernova energy that couples with circumgalactic gas. However, supernova feedback alone fails to expand galactic atmospheres in higher-mass halos. According to the minimalist regulator model, an atmospheric contraction crisis ensues, which may be what triggers strong black-hole feedback. The model also predicts that circumgalactic medium properties emerging from cosmological simulations should depend largely on the specific energy of the outflows they produce, and we interpret the qualitative properties of several numerical simulations in light of that prediction.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>Equilibrium States of Galactic Atmospheres I: The Flip Side of Mass Loading</strong>, G. M. Voit et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07631v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.07631v1</a></p>

<p>This paper presents a new framework for understanding the relationship between a galaxy and its circumgalactic medium (CGM). It focuses on how imbalances between heating and cooling cause either expansion or contraction of the CGM. It does this by tracking \textit{all} of the mass and energy associated with a haloâs baryons, including their gravitational potential energy, even if feedback has pushed some of those baryons beyond the haloâs virial radius. We show how a star-forming galaxyâs equilibrium state can be algebraically derived within the context of this framework, and we analyze how the equilibrium star formation rate depends on supernova feedback. We consider the consequences of varying the mass loading parameter etaM = Mdot_wind / Mdot_* relating a galaxyâs gas mass outflow rate (Mdot_wind) to its star formation rate (Mdot_*) and obtain results that challenge common assumptions. In particular, we find that equilibrium star formation rates in low-mass galaxies are generally insensitive to mass loading, and when mass loading does matter, increasing it actually results in \textit{more} star formation because more supernova energy is needed to resist atmospheric contraction.</p>

<p>We perform fits to DESI, CMB and supernova data to understand the physical origin of the DESI hint for dynamical dark energy. We find that the linear parametrization of the equation of state $w$ may guide to misleading interpretations, such as the hint for a phantom Universe, which are not preferred by the data. Instead, physical quintessence models fit the data well. Model-independently, present observations prefer deviations from the constant dark energy, $w=-1$, only at very low redshifts, $z &lt; \mathcal{O}(0.1)$. We find that this result is driven by low-$z$ supernova data. Therefore, either the fundamental properties of our Universe, characterised by the equation of state $w$ and the Hubble parameter $H$, underwent dramatic changes very recently or, alternatively, we do not fully understand the systematics of our local Universe in a radius of about $300\,h^{-1}\rm Mpc$.</p>

<p>I critically review some claims in the paper ``Almost All Carbon/Oxygen White Dwarfs Can Support Double Detonationsââ (arXiv:2405.19417). The claim of that paper that the community converges on a leading scenario of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the double detonation scenario, is wrong, as hundreds of papers in recent years study five and more different SN Ia scenarios and their channels. Moreover, the finding by that paper that the double detonation scenario with the explosion of the secondary white dwarf (WD; the mass-donor WD) is common, i.e., the triple-detonation channel and the quadruple-detonation sub-channel, implies highly no-spherical explosions. The highly non-spherical explosions contradict the morphologies of many SN Ia remnants. I find that the results of that paper strengthen the claim that the double detonation scenario (with its channels) might account for a non-negligible fraction of peculiar SNe Ia but only for a very small fraction (or non at all) of normal SNe Ia.</p>

<p>We perform a comparative analysis of quintessence and $k$-essence scalar field models in the data analysis perspective. We study the quintessence field with an exponential potential and the $k$-essence field with an inverse square potential in the present work. Before delving into data analysis, we provide a brief perspective on dynamical evolution on both of the models and obtain the stability constraints on the model parameters. We adopt Bayesian inference procedure to estimate the model parameters that best-fit the data. A comprehensive analysis utilizing Observational Hubble data (OHD) and Pantheon+ compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) shows that $k$-essence model fits the data slightly better than the quintessence model while the evidence of these models in comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model is weak. The value of the Hubble constant predicted by both the models is in close agreement with the value obtained by the Planck2018 collaboration assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model.</p>

<p>2024-06-11, <strong>Dynamical properties of mildly relativistic ejecta produced by the mass-loading of gamma-ray burst jets in dense ambient media</strong>, Akihiro Suzuki et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06939v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.06939v1</a></p>

<p>We present the results of a series of 3D special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet in a massive circumstellar medium (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. Our simulations reproduce the jet morphology transitioning from a well-collimated state to a thermal pressure-driven state for a range of CSM masses and outer radii. The jet-CSM interaction redistributes the jet energy to materials expanding into a wide solid angle and results in a quasi-spherical ejecta with 4-velocities from $\Gamma\beta\simeq 0.1$ to $\simeq 10$. The mass and kinetic energy of the ejecta with velocities faster than $0.1c$ are typically of the order of $0.1\,M_\odot$ and $10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}$ with only a weak dependence on the CSM mass and radius for the explored CSM parameter ranges. We find that the numerically obtained density structure of the mildly relativistic ejecta is remarkably universal. The radial density profile is well approximated as a power-law function of the radial velocity with an index of $-5$, $\rho\propto v^{-5}$, in agreement with our previous simulations and other studies, as well as those suggested from recent studies on early-phase spectra of supernovae associated with GRBs. Such fast ejecta rapidly becomes transparent following its expansion. Gradually releasing the trapped thermal photons, the ejecta gives rise to bright UVâoptical emission within $\sim 1$ day. We discuss the potential link of the relativistic ejecta resulting from jet-CSM interaction to GRB-associated supernovae as well as fast and blue optical transients.</p>
