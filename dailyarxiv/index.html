<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Advancements in Streamlining Time-Domain and Multi-Messenger Astronomy Follow-Up Infrastructure at Keck Observatory</strong>, Chien-Hsiu Lee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01500v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01500v1</a></p>

<p>With active time-domain surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility, the anticipated Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and multi-messenger experiments such as LIGO/VIRGO/KANGRA for gravitational wave detection and IceCube for high-energy neutrino events, there is a new era in both time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy. The Astro2020 decadal survey highlights effectively responding to these astronomical alerts in a timely manner as a priority, and thus, there is an urgent need for the development of a seamless follow-up infrastructure at existing facilities that are capable of following up on detections at the survey depths. At the W. M. Keck Observatory (WMKO), we are actively constructing critical infrastructure, aimed at facilitating the Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) trigger, optimizing observational planning, streamlining data acquisition, and enhancing data product accessibility. In this document, we provide an overview of these developing services and place them in context of existing observatory infrastructure like the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) and Data Services Initiative (DSI).</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Convection and the Core $g$-mode in Proto-Compact Stars – A detailed analysis</strong>, Pia Jakobus et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01449v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01449v1</a></p>

<p>We present a detailed analysis of the dynamics of proto-compact star (PCS) convection and the core ${}^2!g_1$-mode in core-collapse supernovae based on general relativistic 2D and 3D neutrino hydrodynamics simulations. Based on 2D simulations, we derive a mode relation for the core $g$-mode frequency in terms of PCS and equation of state parameters, and discuss its limits of accuracy. This relation may prove useful for parameter inference from future supernova gravitational wave (GW) signals if the core $g$-mode or an emission gap at the avoided crossing with the fundamental mode can be detected. The current 3D simulation does not show GW emission from the core $g$-mode due to less power in high-frequency convective motions to excite the mode, however. Analysing the dynamics of PCS convection in 3D, we find that simple scaling laws for convective velocity from mixing-length theory (MLT) do not apply. Energy and lepton number transport is instead governed by a more complex balance between neutrino fluxes and turbulent fluxes that results in roughly uniform rates of change of entropy and lepton number in the PCS convection zone. Electron fraction and enthalpy contrasts in PCS convection are not well captured by the MLT gradient approximation. We find distinctly different spectra for the turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent fluctuations in the electron fraction, which scale approximately as $l^{-1}$ without a downturn at low $l$. We suggest that the different turbulence spectrum of the electron fraction is naturally expected for a passive scalar quantity.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>New upper bound of muon neutrino mass in a short-baseline experiment</strong>, A. M. Attia et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01416v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01416v1</a></p>

<p>In the paper Int.J.Mod.Phys.E 23 (2014) 1450004, the potential of short-baseline experiments was proposed to measure the mass (and parameters of Lorentz-violating effects) of the muon neutrino, where a roughly estimated upper bound of 420 eV was given as a possibility with large unknown uncertainties. In the present work, we improve upon this study by focusing on a feasible and improved experimental setup with today’s technology, eliminating most large uncertainties, with the use of the Geant4 simulation toolkit. High-energy protons collide with a tungsten target, producing a variety of particles, most importantly pions that decay into muon neutrinos. The detector records the time of flight for both muon and anti-muon neutrinos, utilizing light as a reference signal. Additionally, it captures the energy deposited by neutrinos. By applying the dispersion relation, we determine the muon and/or anti-muon neutrino mass. Our improved results reveal a less optimistic but more accurate and realistic estimated upper bound of the muon neutrino mass, providing a new limit of about 150 keV. Notably, this finding is a factor of three lower than the best upper bound previously established in the literature originating from pion decay in flight.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Cutting corners: Hypersphere sampling as a new standard for cosmological emulators</strong>, Andreas Nygaard et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01396v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01396v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmological emulators of observables such as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectra and matter power spectra commonly use training data sampled from a Latin hypercube. This method often incurs high computational costs by covering less relevant parts of the parameter space, especially in high dimensions where only a small fraction of the parameter space yields a significant likelihood.   In this paper, we introduce hypersphere sampling, which instead concentrates sample points in regions with higher likelihoods, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of emulators. A novel algorithm for sampling within a high-dimensional hyperellipsoid aligned with axes of correlation in the cosmological parameters is presented. This method focuses the distribution of training data points on areas of the parameter space that are most relevant to the models being tested, thereby avoiding the computational redundancies common in Latin hypercube approaches.   Comparative analysis using the \textsc{connect} emulation tool demonstrates that hypersphere sampling can achieve similar or improved emulation precision with more than an order of magnitude fewer data points and thus less computational effort than traditional methods. This was tested for both the $\Lambda$CDM model and a 5-parameter extension including Early Dark Energy, massive neutrinos, and additional ultra-relativistic degrees of freedom. Our results suggest that hypersphere sampling holds potential as a more efficient approach for cosmological emulation, particularly suitable for complex, high-dimensional models.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>The science and technology of liquid argon detectors</strong>, W. M. Bonivento et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01153v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01153v1</a></p>

<p>Liquid argon detectors are ubiquitous in particle, astroparticle, and applied physics. They reached an unprecedented level of maturity thanks to more than 20 years of R&amp;D and the operation of large-scale facilities at CERN, Fermilab, and the Gran Sasso laboratories. This article reviews such an impressive advance - from the grounding of the experimental technique up to cutting-edge applications. We commence the review by describing the physical and chemical properties of liquid argon as an active and target medium for particle detection, together with advantages and limitations compared with other liquefied noble gases. We examine the opportunities and challenges of liquid argon detectors operated as calorimeters, scintillators, and time projection chambers. We then delve into the core applications of liquid argon detectors at colliders (ATLAS), accelerator neutrino beams (SBN, DUNE), and underground laboratories (DarkSide, DEAP, ICARUS) for the observation of rare events. We complete the review by looking at unconventional developments (pixelization, combined light-charge readout, Xe-doped devices, all-optical readout) and applications in medical and applied physics to extend this technology’s scope toward novel research fields.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Development of a Bi-solvent Liquid Scintillator with Slow Light Emission</strong>, Hans Th. J. Steiger et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01100v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01100v1</a></p>

<p>One of the most promising approaches for the next generation of neutrino experiments is the realization of large hybrid Cherenkov/scintillation detectors made possible by recent innovations in photodetection technology and liquid scintillator chemistry. The development of a potentially suitable future detector liquid with particularly slow light emission is discussed in the present publication. This cocktail is compared with respect to its fundamental characteristics (scintillation efficiency, transparency, and time profile of light emission) with liquid scintillators currently used in large-scale neutrino detectors. In addition, the optimization of the admixture of wavelength shifters for a scintillator with particularly high light emission is presented. Furthermore, the pulse-shape discrimination capabilities of the novel medium was studied using a pulsed particle accelerator driven neutron source. Beyond that, purification methods based on column chromatography and fractional vacuum distillation for the co-solvent DIN (Diisopropylnaphthalene) are discussed.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Approaching the conformal limit of quark matter with different chemical potentials</strong>, Connor Brown et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01032v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01032v1</a></p>

<p>We study in detail the influence of different chemical potentials (baryon, charged, strange, and neutrino) on how and how fast a free gas of quarks in the zero-temperature limit reaches the conformal limit. We discuss the influence of non-zero masses, the inclusion of leptons, and different constraints, such as charge neutrality, zero-net strangeness, and fixed lepton fraction. We also investigate for the first time how the symmetry energy of the system under some of these conditions approaches the conformal limit. Finally, we briefly discuss what kind of corrections are expected from perturbative QCD as one goes away from the conformal limit.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Right-handed neutrino dark matter in $U(1)_X$SSM</strong>, Ming-Yue Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00961v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.00961v1</a></p>

<p>There is strong evidence for the existence of dark matter in a number of current experiments. We study dark matter using the $U(1)_X$SSM obtained from the $U(1)_X$ extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). In the $U(1)_X$SSM, we use the right-handed neutrino as a dark matter candidate, whose lightest mass eigenstate has cold dark matter features. In this paper, the relic density of right-handed neutrino as dark matter is investigated. For dark matter scattering, both spin-independent and spin-dependent cross sections are studied. In the final numerical results obtained, some parameter spaces can satisfy the constraints of the relic density and dark matter direct detection experiments.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>The Effect of a Dark Matter Core on the Structure of a Rotating Neutron Star</strong>, Andreas Konstantinou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01487v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01487v1</a></p>

<p>Neutron stars represent unique laboratories, offering insights into the physics of supranuclear-density matter and serving as potential hosts for dark matter. This study explores the impact of dark matter cores on rapidly rotating neutron stars through the two-fluid approximation, assuming minimal interaction between baryonic matter and dark matter. The investigation employs phenomenological models for fermionic and bosonic dark matter, revealing that universal relations governing mass and radius changes due to rotation remain largely unaffected in the presence of a dark matter core. Specifically, for a 5 % dark matter mass fraction, the percent deviations in total mass ($M_{tot}$), the baryonic equatorial radius ($R_{Be}$), and polar-to-equatorial baryonic radius ratio ($R_{ratioB}$) are within 3.9 %, 1.8 %, and 1.4 %, respectively. These findings suggest that the universal relations governing neutron star shape can be utilized to infer constraints on the properties of dark matter cores even in cases where the dark matter significantly softens the neutron star’s equation of state.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>The Vector Dark Matter, LHC Constraints Including a 95 GeV Light Higgs Boson</strong>, Seyed Yaser Ayazi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01132v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01132v1</a></p>

<p>We study LHC searches for an extension of the Standard Model (SM) by exploiting an additional Abelian $U_D(1)$ gauge symmetry and a complex scalar Higgs portal. As the scalar is charged under this gauge symmetry, a vector dark matter (VDM) candidate can satisfy the observed relic abundance and limits from direct dark matter (DM) searches. The ATLAS and CMS experiments have developed a broad search program for the DM candidates, including associate production of Higgs boson, Z boson and top quark which couple to DM. In this paper, we perform an extensive analysis to constrain the model by using these experiments at LHC. It can be seen that the LHC results can exclude some parts of the parameter space which are still allowed by relic density and the direct detection searches. Furthermore, exclusion limits on the parameter space of the model by using the new results of CMS and ATLAS collaborations for new light Higgs boson with mass $\sim95~\rm GeV$ are provided.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Echo-free quality factor of a multilayer axion haloscope</strong>, Juan F. Hernández-Cabrera et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01096v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01096v1</a></p>

<p>We report a methodology to determine the quality factor ($Q$) in implementations of the so-called dielectric haloscope, a new concept of wavy dark matter detector equipped with a multilayered resonator. An anechoic chamber enables the observation of the resonance frequency and its amplitude for an unlimited series of layers for the first time, which is conveniently filtered. The frequency-normalized power enhancement measured in a Dark-photons \&amp; Axion-Like particles Interferometer (DALI) prototype is a few hundred per layer over a sweep bandwidth of half a hundred MHz. In light of this result, this scaled-down prototype is sensitive to axions saturating the local dark matter density with a coupling to photons between $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ and $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim$ few $\times 10^{-14}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at frequencies of several dozens of GHz once cooled down to the different working temperatures of the experiment and immersed in magnetic fields ranging from 1 T to 10 T; while the sensitivity of the full-scale DALI is projected at $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim\mathrm{few}\times10^{-15}$ GeV$^{-1}$ over the entire 25–250 {\mu}eV range since $Q\gtrsim10^4$ is expected.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Euclid – The Dark Universe detective</strong>, L. Linke et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01037v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01037v1</a></p>

<p>Euclid is a recently launched medium-class mission by the European Space Agency (ESA) designed to measure cosmological parameters, test the cosmological standard model, and explore the nature of dark matter and dark energy. To this end, Euclid conducts a survey of up to 14000 square degrees of the extra-galactic sky and obtains optical and near-infrared photometric measurements for more than a billion galaxies as well as near-infrared slitless spectroscopy for more than 35 million galaxies. These observations will be used to estimate galaxy clustering and cosmic shear. It is expected that Euclid will achieve percent-level constraints on the Dark Energy equation of state parameter. The survey will also be exploited with a range of other cosmological probes and prove revolutionary for non-cosmological science.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Identifying Halos in Cosmological Simulations with Continuous Wavelet Analysis: The 2D Case</strong>, Minxing Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00920v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.00920v1</a></p>

<p>Continuous wavelet analysis is gaining popularity in science and engineering for its ability to analyze data across spatial and scale domain simultaneously. In this study, we introduce a wavelet-based method to identify halos and assess its feasibility in two-dimensional (2D) scenarios. We begin with the generation of four pseudo-2D datasets from the SIMBA dark matter simulation by compressing thin slices of three-dimensional (3D) data into 2D. We then calculate the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) directly from the particle distributions, identify local maxima that represent actual halos, and segment the CWT to delineate halo boundaries. A comparison with the traditional Friends-of-Friends (FOF) method shows that our CWT-identified halos, while containing slightly fewer particles, have smoother boundaries and are more compact in dense regions. In contrast, the CWT method can link particles over greater distances to form halos in sparse regions due to its spatial segmentation scheme. The spatial distribution and halo power spectrum of both CWT and FOF halos demonstrate substantial consistency, validating the 2D applicability of CWT for halo detection. Our identification scheme operates with a linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, suggesting its suitability for analyzing significantly larger datasets in the future.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Revisiting the Concordance $Λ$CDM model using Gamma-Ray Bursts together with Supernovae Ia and Planck data</strong>, Shahnawaz A. Adil et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01452v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01452v1</a></p>

<p>The Hubble constant, $H_0$, tension is the tension among the local probes, Supernovae Ia, and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. It has been almost a decade, and this tension still puzzles the community. Here, we add intermediate redshift probes, such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) and Quasars (QS0s), to check if and to what extent these higher redshift probes can reduce this tension. We use the three-dimensional fundamental plane relation among the prompt peak luminosity, the luminosity at the end of the plateau emission, and its rest frame duration. We find similar trend in GRB intrinsic parameters as previously seen in Pantheon-Plus intrinsic parameters. We find an apparent $3.14\sigma$ tension for the GRB intrinsic parameter $b$. Indeed, this tension disappears and the parameters are actually compatible within $2.26\sigma$. Another interesting point is that the 3D relation plays an important role in conjunction with Supernovae data with Pantheon Plus and that this apparent discrepancy show how it is important the correction for selection biases and redshift evolution. The incorporation of redshift evolution correction results in a reduction of the GRB tension to $2.26\sigma$ when adjusting correction parameters. We envision that with more data this indication of tension will possibly disappear when the evolutionary parameters of GRBs are computed with increased precision.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Modeling of Granulation in Red Supergiants in the Magellanic Clouds with the Gaussian Process Regressions</strong>, Zehao Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01405v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01405v1</a></p>

<p>The granulation of red supergiants (RSGs) in the Magellanic Clouds are systematically investigated by combining the latest RSGs samples and light curves from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment and the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae. The present RSGs samples are firstly examined for foreground stars and possible misidentified sources, and the light curves are sequentially checked to remove the outliers by white noise and photometric quality. The Gaussian Process regression is used to model the granulation, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo is applied to derive the granulation amplitude $\sigma$ and the period of the undamped oscillator $\rho$, as well as the damping timescale $\tau$. The dimensionless quality factor $Q$ is then calculated through $Q=\pi \tau/\rho$. RSGs around $Q = 1/\sqrt{2}$ are considered to have significant granulation signals and are used for further analysis. Combining granulation parameters with stellar parameters, robust scaling relations for the timescale $\rho$ are established, while the scaling relations for amplitude $\sigma$ are represented by a piecewise function, possibly related to the tendency of amplitudes in faint RSGs to converge towards a certain value. Comparing results between the SMC and LMC confirms that amplitudes and timescales become larger with metallicity. In examining the scaling relations between the two galaxies, it is found that $\rho$ is nearly independent of metallicity, whereas $\sigma$ is more significantly affected by metallicity. The Gaussian Process method is compared with the periodogram fitting of the granulations, and the advantages of either are discussed.</p>

<p>Nova shocks behave like scaled-down supernova remnant shocks with a lifetime of only a few weeks or months, thereby providing a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of non-relativistic shocks as well as the shock acceleration physics.Recently, GeV and TeV gamma-ray emissions from an outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi have been observed. The light curves of the gamma-ray emissions suggest that they arise from an external shock, which is formed as the nova ejecta interacts with the ambient medium. The shock is thought to transit from an adiabatic shock to a radiative one at later times, but no such later observations are available for RS Ophiuchi. In addition, the spectral evolution of the gamma-ray outburst of RS Ophiuchi was not well measured, and hence the related particle acceleration mechanisms are not well understood. T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is another recurrent nova in Milky Way and its last outburst was nearly ten times brighter than RS Ophiuichi. Recently the optical light curve of T CrB displayed a state transition behavior before the eruption, and it was predicted that T CrB will undergo an outburst in the near future. By performing a theoretical investigation, we find that Fermi-LAT could capture the transition of the shock from the adiabatic phase to the radiative phase at the GeV band, thanks to a longer detectable time than that of RS Ophiuchi.Due to its higher brightness, we also find that imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) such as MAGIC and VERITAS, and extensive air shower experiments such as LHAASO could detect the nova outburst and measure the gamma-ray spectrum in the very-high-energy (VHE, energy above 0.1 TeV) band more precisely. This can be used to constrain the high-energy cutoff index in the accelerated proton spectrum and the acceleration efficiency, which will shed light on the particle acceleration physics in nova shocks.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Bumpy Superluminous Supernovae Powered by Magnetar-star Binary Engine</strong>, Jin-Ping Zhu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01224v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01224v1</a></p>

<p>Wolf-Rayet stars in close binary systems can be tidally spun up by their companions, potentially leaving behind fast-spinning highly-magnetized neutron stars, known as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">magnetars", after core collapse. These newborn magnetars can transfer rotational energy into heating and accelerating the ejecta, producing hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). In this {\em{Letter}}, we propose that the magnetar wind of the newborn magnetar could significantly evaporate its companion star, typically a main-sequence or helium star, if the binary system is not disrupted by the SN kick. The subsequent heating and acceleration of the evaporated star material along with the SN ejecta by the magnetar wind can produce a post-peak bump in the SLSN lightcurve. Our model can reproduce the primary peaks and post-peak bumps of four example observed multiband SLSN lightcurves, revealing that the mass of the evaporated material could be $\sim0.4-0.6\,M\_\odot$ if the material is hydrogen-rich. We suggest that the magnetar could induce strongly enhanced evaporation from its companion star near the pericenter if the orbit of the post-SN binary is highly eccentric, ultimately generating multiple post-peak bumps in the SLSN lightcurves. This</code>magnetar-star binary engine” model offers a possible explanation for the evolution of polarization, along with the origin and velocity broadening of late-time hydrogen or helium broad spectral features observed in some bumpy SLSNe. The diversity in the lightcurves and spectra of SLSNe may be attributed to the wide variety of companion stars and post-SN binary systems.</p>
