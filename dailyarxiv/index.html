<p>2025-02-18, <strong>The cosmological Mass Varying Neutrino model in the late universe</strong>, Olga Avsajanishvili et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13097v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.13097v1</a></p>

<p>The cosmological Mass Varying Neutrino model beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario is considered. The interaction of the fermionic field and the scalar field with the inverse power law Ratra-Peebles potential via the Yukawa coupling is studied in detail. Depending on the model parameter $\alpha$ of the Ratra-Peebles potential of the scalar field, the expansion rate of the universe, the mass equation, the mass of the scalar field, the sum of neutrino masses, the mutual influence of the sum of neutrino masses and the value of the scalar field Ratra-Peebles potential as well as the total density of the thermodynamic potential of the coupled fermionic and scalar fields at the critical point are explored. The values of the sum of neutrino masses $m_\nu(a_0)\leq0.07~{\rm eV}$ calculated for values of the model parameter $\alpha$ of the Ratra-Peebles potential $0&lt;\alpha\leq0.016$ are consistent with the constraint $m_\nu(a_0)&lt;0.071~{\rm eV}$ of the cosmological DESI measurements, while the values $m_\nu(a_0)\leq0.45~{\rm eV}$ for $0&lt;\alpha\leq0.143$ are consistent with the upper limit $m_\nu(a_0)&lt;0.45~{\rm eV}$ obtained in the KATRIN experiment.</p>

<p>2025-02-18, <strong>On testing in-vacuo dispersion with the most energetic neutrinos: KM3-230213A case study</strong>, Giovanni Amelino-Camelia et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13093v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.13093v2</a></p>

<p>The phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion, an effect such that quantum properties of spacetime slow down particles proportionally to their energies, has been a very active research area since the advent of the Fermi telescope. One of the assumptions made in this 15-year effort is that the phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion has a particle-energy sweet spot: the energy of the particle should be large enough to render the analysis immune to source-intrinsic confounding effects but still small enough to facilitate the identification of the source of the particle. We use the gigantic energy of KM3-230213A as an opportunity to challenge this expectation. For a neutrino of a few hundred PeVs a transient source could have been observed at lower energies several years earlier, even assuming the characteristic scale of in-vacuo dispersion to be close to the Planck scale. We report that GRB090401B is in excellent directional agreement with KM3-230213A, and we discuss a strategy of in-vacuo-dispersion analysis suitable for estimating the significance of KM3-230213A as a GRB090401B-neutrino candidate. The p-value resulting from our analysis (0.015) is not small enough to warrant any excitement, but small enough to establish the point that a handful of such coincidences would be sufficient to meaningfully test in-vacuo dispersion.</p>

<p>2025-02-18, <strong>Inverse Seesaw Mechanism and Axion Portal Fermionic Dark Matter</strong>, Nakorn Thongyoi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13002v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.13002v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM) that addresses both the smallness of neutrino masses and the dark matter (DM) puzzle via the inverse seesaw mechanism and an axion portal fermionic DM. This model generates light neutrino masses without requiring high energy scales, enhancing its testability in future collider experiments. An axion-like particle (ALP) connects the SM and DM sectors, yielding a distinct phenomenology and a positive contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $(g-2)$ anomaly. Our analysis shows that the model is consistent with constraints from neutrino oscillations, DM relic density, and indirect detection, as well as providing a solution to the $g-2$ anomaly. The TeV-scale scalar sector and ALP interactions suggest potential signals in collider experiments and astrophysical observations. This work offers a unified framework to address neutrino masses and DM, with implications for particle physics and cosmology.</p>

<p>2025-02-18, <strong>KM3-230213A: An Ultra-High Energy Neutrino from a Year-Long Astrophysical Transient</strong>, Andrii Neronov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12986v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.12986v1</a></p>

<p>The Km3NET collaboration has recently reported the detection of a neutrino event with energy in excess of 100 PeV. This detection is in 2.5-3$\sigma$ tension with the upper limit on the neutrino flux at this energy imposed by IceCube and the Pierre Auger Observatory, if the event is considered part of the diffuse all-sky neutrino flux. We explore an alternative possibility that the event originates from a flare of an isolated source. We show that the data of Km3NET, IceCube and the Pierre Auger Observatory are consistent with the possibility of a source flare of duration $T \lesssim 2$ yr with muon neutrino flux $F \approx 3\times 10^{-10}(1\mbox{ yr }/ T)$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Constraints on the neutrino spectrum indicate that the protons responsible for the neutrino emission have a very hard spectrum in the $E_p\gtrsim 10^{19}$ eV energy range, or otherwise that the neutrinos are produced by photohadronic interactions with infrared photons. The all-sky rate of similar neutrino flaring sources is constrained to be $R\lesssim 0.4/$ yr.</p>

<p>2025-02-18, <strong>Resonant axion-plasmon conversion in neutron star magnetospheres</strong>, H. Terças et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12983v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.12983v1</a></p>

<p>Resonant axion-plasmon conversion in the magnetospheres of magnetars may substantially impact the landscape of dark-matter axion detection. This work explores how resonant axion-plasmon conversion, through a mechanism that is analogous to the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (NSW) effect in neutrinos, modify the expected radio signals from axion-photon conversions observed on Earth. Critically, the resonant conversion radius lies within the region expected for axion-photon conversion, introducing a nonradiative power loss that diminishes the anticipated photon flux. Our analysis demonstrates that this effect can reduce radio telescope sensitivities, shifting them into regions excluded by previous experiments. These findings compel a reassessment of experimental constraints derived from radio signatures of axion-photon conversions and highlight the necessity of accounting for plasmon effects in astrophysical axion searches. The presented corrections provide critical insights for refining the detection strategies of future telescope-based dark matter axion experiments.</p>

<p>2025-02-18, <strong>Zee-Babu model in a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry and modular stabilization</strong>, Tatsuo Kobayashi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12662v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.12662v1</a></p>

<p>We study a Zee-Babu neutrino model in a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry, and we construct a model so that there are minimum free parameters (two complex parameters). We find only the normal hierarchy is allowed. Moreover, the allowed region to satisfy the neutrino oscillation data is localized at nearby $\tau=\omega$. The small absolute deviation plays a crucial role in fitting two mixings of $s^2_{23}$ and $s^2_{12}$. In addition, we obtain several predictions on Majorana and Dirac CP phases, and neutrinoless double beta decay as shown in our chi square numerical analysis. We also study modulus stabilization within the framework of non-supersymmetric models. In the end, we compute the expansion of modular forms at nearby $\tau=\omega$ in the Appendix so that one can apply them for a model and understand its analytical structure.</p>

<p>2025-02-18, <strong>New gravitational wave probe of vector dark matter</strong>, Alisha Marriott-Best et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13116v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.13116v1</a></p>

<p>The longitudinal components of massive vector fields generated during inflation constitute a well-motivated dark matter candidate, with interesting phenomenological implications. During the epoch of radiation domination following inflation, their spectrum exhibits a peak at small scales, whose amplitude and position are governed by the parameters of the dark matter model. We calculate the stochastic gravitational wave spectrum induced at second order in fluctuations by such a longitudinal vector peak. We demonstrate that the amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum can, in principle, reach significant values at nano-Hertz frequencies or lower. This result suggests a novel gravitational wave probe to test inflationary vector dark matter scenarios, independent from assumptions on the coupling of dark vectors to the Standard Model. Additionally, we derive new analytical formulas for the longitudinal vector transfer functions during radiation domination, offering a valuable tool for characterising the convolution integrals that govern the properties of the induced gravitational waves.</p>

<p>2025-02-18, <strong>Does dark matter fall in the same way as standard model particles? A direct constraint of Euler’s equation with cosmological data</strong>, Nastassia Grimm et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12843v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.12843v1</a></p>

<p>Since dark matter particles have never been directly detected, we do not know how they move, and in particular we do not know how they fall inside gravitational potential wells. Usually it is assumed that dark matter only interacts gravitationally with itself and with particles of the standard model, and therefore that its motion is governed by Euler’s equation. In this paper, we test this assumption for the first time at cosmological scales, by combining measurements of galaxy velocities with measurements of gravitational potential wells, encoded in the Weyl potential. We find that current data are consistent with Euler’s equation at redshifts $z\in [0.3,0.8]$, and we place constraints on the strength of a potential fifth force, which would alter the way dark matter particles fall. We find that a positive fifth force cannot exceed 7% of the gravitational interaction strength, while a negative fifth force is limited to 21%. The coming generation of surveys, including the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) will drastically improve the constraints, allowing to constrain a departure from pure gravitational interaction at the level of 2%.</p>

<p>2025-02-18, <strong>Quantum-mechanical numerical model of interaction between dark atom and nucleus of substance</strong>, T. E. Bikbaev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12407v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.12407v1</a></p>

<p>The hypothesis of composite $XHe$ dark atoms may provide solution to the long-standing problem of direct searches for dark matter particles. The main problem of the $XHe$ dark atom is its ability to strongly interact with the nucleus of substance, arising from the unshielded nuclear attraction between the helium nucleus and the nucleus of matter. It is assumed that in order to prevent the destruction of the bound structure of dark atom, the effective potential of interaction between $XHe$ and the nucleus of substance must have dipole Coulomb barrier that prevents the fusion of dark matter atom particles with the nucleus of substance. The problem in describing the interaction between dark atom and substance nucleus is the three-body problem, for which an exact analytical solution is not available. Consequently, to assess the physical meaning of the proposed scenario, it is essential to develop a numerical approach. Our approach involves consistently developing an accurate quantum mechanical description of this three-body system, comprising bound dark atom and the external nucleus of substance. We incorporate the necessary effects and interactions to enhance the precision of the results, which helps to elucidate the most significant aspects of the proposed dark atom scenario.</p>

<p>2025-02-18, <strong>Galactic magnetic fields II. Applying the model to nearby galaxies</strong>, Rion Glenn Nazareth et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13029v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.13029v1</a></p>

<p>Many spiral galaxies host magnetic fields with energy densities comparable to those of the turbulent and thermal motions of their interstellar gas. However, quantitative comparison between magnetic field properties inferred from observation and those obtained from theoretical modeling has been lacking. In Paper I we developed a simple, axisymmetric galactic dynamo model that uses various observational data as input. Here we apply our model to calculate radial profiles of azimuthally and vertically averaged magnetic field strength and pitch angle, gas velocity dispersion and scale height, turbulent correlation time and length, and the sizes of supernova remnants for the galaxies M31, M33, M51, and NGC 6946, using input data collected from the literature. Scaling factors are introduced to account for a lack of precision in both theory and observation. Despite the simplicity of our model, its outputs agree fairly well with galaxy properties inferred from observation. Additionally, we find that most of the parameter values are similar between galaxies. We extend the model to predict the magnetic field pitch angles arising from a combination of mean-field dynamo action and the winding up of the random small-scale field owing to the large-scale radial shear. We find their magnitudes to be much smaller than those of the pitch angles measured in polarized radio and far infrared emission. This suggests that effects not included in our model, such as effects associated with spiral arms, are needed to explain the pitch angle values.</p>

<p>2025-02-18, <strong>Equivalence of Dark Energy Models: A Theoretical and Bayesian Perspective</strong>, David Tamayo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12915v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.12915v1</a></p>

<p>We explore the background equivalence among three dark energy models by constructing explicit mappings between dynamical dark energy (DDE), interacting dark energy (IDE), and running vacuum (RV). In our approach, the dark sector functions that characterize each model-such as the equation of state parameter $\bar{w}(a)$ for DDE, the interaction term $Q$ for IDE, and the functional form $\Lambda(H)$ for RV-are transformed into one another under specific assumptions. Extending previous work by von Marttens et al., we demonstrate that running vacuum models, characterized by $\Lambda(H) = a_0 + a_1 \dot{H} + a_2 H^2$, can be reinterpreted as an interacting dark energy model with $Q = 3H\gamma \hat{\rho}_c$, which in turn is equivalent to a dynamic dark energy model with an appropriately defined $\bar{w}(a)$. Using Bayesian analysis with Type Ia supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Chronometers, our observational constraints confirm that these theoretical equivalences hold at the background level. This study underscores the importance of seeking convergence in dark energy models, facilitating a better understanding of the dark sector.</p>

<p>2025-02-18, <strong>Testing and Combining Transient Spectral Classification Tools on 4MOST-like Blended Spectra</strong>, Andrew Milligan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12890v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.12890v1</a></p>

<p>With the 4-meter Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) expected to provide an influx of transient spectra when it begins observations in early 2026 we consider the potential for real-time classification of these spectra. We investigate three extant spectroscopic transient classifiers: the Deep Automated Supernova and Host classifier (DASH), Next Generation SuperFit (NGSF) and SuperNova IDentification (SNID), with a focus on comparing the efficiency and purity of the transient samples they produce. We discuss our method for simulating realistic, 4MOST-like, host-galaxy contaminated spectra and determining quality cuts for each classifier used to ensure pure SN Ia samples while maintaining efficient classification in other transient classes. We investigate the classifiers individually and in combinations. We find that a combination of DASH and NGSF can produce a SN Ia sample with a purity of 99.9% while successfully classifying 70% of SNe Ia. However, it struggles to classify non-SN Ia transients. We investigate photometric cuts to transient magnitude and transient flux fraction, finding that both can be used to improve transient classification efficiencies by 7–25% depending on the transient subclass. Finally, we present an example classification plan for live classification and the predicted purities and efficiencies across five transient classes: Ia, Ibc, II, superluminous and non-supernova transients.</p>

<p>2025-02-18, <strong>The Preference for Evolving Dark Energy from Cosmological Distance Measurements and Possible Signatures in the Growth Rate of Perturbations</strong>, Ryan E. Keeley et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12667v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.12667v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, we use a flexible parametrization of the equation of state of dark energy to explore its possible evolution with datasets from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Planck cosmic microwave background, and either the 5-year Dark Energy Survey (DES) or the Pantheon+ (PP) supernova (SN) compilation. This parametrization, called transitional dark energy, allows for rapid changes in the equation of state but also changes like that in the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. We find a 3.8{\sigma} preference for evolving dark energy over {\Lambda}CDM with the DES dataset and a weaker 2.4{\sigma} preference when using the PP dataset. This corroborates the finding of the DESI Collaboration, who found that their baryon acoustic oscillation data preferred evolving dark energy when fit with the CPL parametrization of the equation of state. Our analysis reveals no significant outliers in the DESI data around the TDE best-fit, while the data is asymmetrically distributed around the {\Lambda}CDM best-fit model such that the measured distances are on average smaller. The DESI and SN data both prefer an expansion history that implies a higher dark energy density around z=0.5 than in the Planck-{\Lambda}CDM model, with the inferred equation of state being greater than -1 around z=0 and close to or below -1 at z&gt;0.5. We show that when the expansion rate is greater than that in the Planck-{\Lambda}CDM model (around z=0.5), the growth rate calculated assuming General Relativity is suppressed relative to the Planck-{\Lambda}CDM model, and it rebounds as the expansion rate differences between the models become smaller closer to the present time. The resulting flattening of the $f\sigma_8(z)$ curve compared to the {\Lambda}CDM model could be an independent signature of the temporal evolution of dark energy.</p>
