<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Pseudo-Dirac Neutrinos and Relic Neutrino Matter Effect on the High-energy Neutrino Flavor Composition</strong>, P. S. Bhupal Dev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18507v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18507v1</a></p>

<p>We show that if neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac, they can potentially affect the flavor ratio predictions for the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube. In this context, we point out a novel matter effect induced by the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) on the flavor ratio composition. Specifically, the active-sterile neutrino oscillations over the astrophysical baseline lead to an energy-dependent flavor ratio at Earth due to the C$\nu$B matter effect, which is distinguishable from the vacuum oscillation effect, provided there is a local C$\nu$B overdensity. Considering the projected precision of the 3-neutrino oscillation parameter measurements and improved flavor triangle measurements, we show that the next-generation neutrino telescopes, such as IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT, can probe the pseudo-Dirac neutrino hypothesis in a distinctive way.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>$Λ_{\rm s}$CDM cosmology: Alleviating major cosmological tensions by predicting standard neutrino properties</strong>, Anita Yadav et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18496v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18496v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate a two-parameter extension of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model by allowing variations in the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ and their total mass $\sum m_\nu$. Our motivation is twofold: (i) to examine whether $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM retains its success in fitting the data and addressing major cosmological tensions, without suggesting a need for a deviation from the standard model of particle physics, and (ii) to determine whether the data indicate new physics that could potentially address cosmological tensions, either in the post-recombination universe through the late-time mirror AdS-dS transition, or in the pre-recombination universe through modifications in the standard values of $N_{\rm eff}$ and $\sum m_\nu$, or both. Within the extended $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, referred to as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM+$N_{\rm eff}$+$\sum m_{\rm \nu}$, we find no significant tension when considering the Planck-alone analysis. We observe that incorporating BAO data limits the further success of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM extension. However, the weakly model-dependent BAOtr data, along with Planck and Planck+PP\&amp;SH0ES, favor $H_0\sim 73\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}\, Mpc^{-1}}$. In cases where BAOtr dataset is used, the mirror AdS-dS transition is very effective in providing enhanced $H_0$ values, and thus the model requires no significant deviation from the standard value of $N_{\rm eff} = 3.044$. Both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are effectively addressed, with some compromise in the case of the Planck+BAO dataset. Finally, the upper bounds obtained on $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.5$~eV are fully compatible with neutrino oscillation experiments. Our findings provide evidence that late-time physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, such as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, without altering the standard pre-recombination universe, can suffice to alleviate the major cosmological tensions.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Transition magnetic moment of Majorana neutrinos in the triplets next-to-minimal MSSM</strong>, Zhao-Yang Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18323v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18323v1</a></p>

<p>The TNMSSM is an attractive extension of the Standard Model. It combines the advantages of the NMSSM and the TMSSM to give three tiny Majorana neutrinos masses via a type I+II seesaw mechanism. With the on-shell renormalization scheme, we consider the neutrino masses up to one loop approximation. Applying the effective Lagrangian method, we study the transition magnetic moments of Majorana neutrinos and consider the normal hierarchy (NH) and inverse hierarchy (IH) neutrino mass spectra within the constraints of experimental data on neutrino oscillations. The solar neutrino transition magnetic moment is further deduced, and compared with the XENONnT experiment limit.</p>

<p>2024-06-25, <strong>Discrete dark matter with light Dirac neutrinos</strong>, Debasish Borah et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17861v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.17861v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a new realisation of light Dirac neutrino mass and dark matter (DM) within the framework of a non-Abelian discrete flavour symmetry $A_4$. In addition to $A_4$, we also consider a $Z_2$ and an unbroken global lepton number symmetry $U(1)_L$ to keep unwanted terms away while guaranteeing the Dirac nature of light neutrinos. The field content, their transformations and flavon vacuum alignments are chosen in such a way that the type-I Dirac seesaw generates only one light Dirac neutrino mass while the other two masses arise from scotogenic contributions at one-loop. The symmetry breaking of $A_4$ leaves a remnant $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry responsible for stabilising DM. Dirac nature of light neutrinos introduces additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ within reach of cosmic microwave background experiments.</p>

<p>2024-06-25, <strong>The compact circumstellar material of SN 2024ggi: Another supernova with a pre-explosion effervescent zone and jet-driven explosion</strong>, Noam Soker et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17751v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.17751v1</a></p>

<p>I examine recent theoretical studies and observations of the recent core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 20224ggi and find that the likely explanation for its dense, compact circumstellar material is an effervescent model, where parcels or streams of gas are uplifted by stellar convection and pulsation and fall back. The effervescent zone exists alongside the regular wind from the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor of SN 2024ggi. I find that an extended wind-acceleration zone encounters some difficulties in accounting for the required CSM mass. Recent modelling finds the explosion energy of SN 2024ggi to be &gt;1e51 erg and up to 2e51 erg. I examine this explosion energy against a recent study of the delayed neutrino explosion mechanism and find that this mechanism has difficulties in accounting for the required energy. This suggests that the explosion was caused by the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM), adding to other recent pieces of evidence supporting the JJEM, particularly point-symmetric CCSN remnants.</p>

<p>2024-06-25, <strong>The SNEWS 2.0 Alert Software for the Coincident Detection of Neutrinos from Core-Collapse Supernovae</strong>, M. Kara et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17743v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.17743v1</a></p>

<p>The neutrino signal from the next galactic core-collapse supernova will provide an invaluable early warning of the explosion. By combining the burst trigger from several neutrino detectors, the location of the explosion can be triangulated minutes to hours before the optical emission becomes visible, while also reducing the rate of false-positive triggers. To enable multi-messenger follow-up of nearby supernovae, the SuperNova Early Warning System 2.0 (SNEWS 2.0) will produce a combined alert using a global network of neutrino detectors. This paper describes the trigger publishing and alert formation framework of the SNEWS 2.0 network. The framework is built on the HOPSKOTCH publish-subscribe system to easily incorporate new detectors into the network, and it implements a coincidence system to form alerts and estimate a false-positive rate for the combined triggers. The paper outlines the structure of the SNEWS 2.0 software and the initial testing of coincident signals.</p>

<p>2024-06-25, <strong>Illuminating the dark: mono-$γ$ signals at NA62</strong>, D. Barducci et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17599v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.17599v1</a></p>

<p>Dipole interactions between dark sector states or between a Standard Model particle and a dark state can efficiently be searched for via high-intensity fixed-target facilities. We propose to look for the associated mono-$\gamma$ signature at the NA62 experiment running in beam-dump mode. Focusing on models of dipole inelastic Dark Matter and active-sterile neutrino dipole interactions, we compute the corresponding expected sensitivities finding promising prospects for discovery.</p>

<p>2024-06-25, <strong>A Hybrid Approach to Event Reconstruction for Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes Combining Machine Learning and Likelihood Fitting</strong>, Georg Schwefer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17502v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.17502v1</a></p>

<p>The imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique provides potentially the highest angular resolution achievable in astronomy at energies above the X-ray waveband. High-resolution measurements provide the key to progress on many of the major questions in high-energy astrophysics, including the sites of particle acceleration to PeV energies. The potential of the next-generation CTA observatory in this regard can be realised with the help of improved algorithms for the reconstruction of the air-shower direction and energy. Hybrid methods combining likelihood-fitting techniques with neural networks represent a particularly promising approach and have recently been applied to the reconstruction of astrophysical neutrinos. Here, we present the FreePACT algorithm, a hybrid reconstruction method for IACTs. In this, making use of the neural ratio estimation technique from the field of likelihood-free inference, the analytical likelihood used in traditional image likelihood fitting is replaced by a neural network that approximates the charge probability density function for each pixel in the camera. The performance of this algorithm is demonstrated using simulations of the planned CTA southern array. For this setup, FreePACT provides significant performance improvements over analytical likelihood techniques, with improvements in angular and energy resolution of 25% or more over a wide energy range and an angular resolution as low as 40 arcseconds at energies above 50 TeV for observations at 20 degrees zenith angle. It also yields more accurate estimations of the uncertainties on the reconstructed parameters and speeds up the reconstruction compared to analytical likelihood techniques while showing the same stability with respect to changes in the observation conditions. Therefore, the FreePACT method is a promising upgrade over the current state-of-the-art likelihood event reconstruction techniques.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Studying single-electron traps in newly fabricated Skipper-CCDs for the Oscura experiment using the pocket-pumping technique</strong>, S. E. Perez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18502v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18502v1</a></p>

<p>Understanding and characterizing very low-energy ($\sim$eV) background sources is a must in rare-event searches. Oscura, an experiment aiming to probe electron recoils from sub-GeV dark matter using a 10-kg skipper-CCD detector, has recently fabricated its first two batches of sensors. In this work, we present the characterization of defects/contaminants identified in the buried-channel region of these newly fabricated skipper-CCDs. These defects/contaminants produce deferred charge from trap emission in the images next to particle tracks, which can be spatially resolved due to the sub-electron resolution achieved with these sensors. Using the trap-pumping technique, we measured the energy and cross section associated to these traps in three Oscura prototype sensors from different fabrication batches which underwent different gettering methods during fabrication. Results suggest that the type of defects/contaminants is more closely linked to the fabrication batch rather than to the gettering method used. The exposure-dependent single-electron rate (SER) of one of these sensors was measured $\sim$100~m underground, yielding $(1.8\pm 0.3)\times10^{-3}~e^-$/pix/day at 131K. The impact of the identified traps on the measured exposure-dependent SER is evaluated via a Monte Carlo simulation. Results suggest that the exposure-dependent SER of Oscura prototype sensors would be lower in lower background environments as expected.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Hint to Supersymmetry from GR Vacuum</strong>, Gia Dvali et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18402v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18402v1</a></p>

<p>The $S$-matrix formulation of gravity suggests that the $\theta$-vacuum structure must not be sustained by the theory. We point out that, when applied to the vacuum of general relativity, this criterion hints to supersymmetry. The topological susceptibility of gravitational vacuum induced by Eguchi-Hanson instantons can be eliminated neither by spin-$1/2$ fermions nor by an axion coupled via them since such fermions do not provide instanton zero modes. Instead, the job is done by a spin-$3/2$ fermion, hence realizing a local supersymmetry. This scenario also necessitates the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry and predicts the existence of axion of $R$-symmetry which gets mass exclusively from the gravitational instantons. The $R$-axion can be a viable dark matter candidate. Matching between the index and the anomaly imposes a constraint that spin-$1/2$ fermions should not contribute to the chiral gravitational anomaly.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Euclid preparation. Sensitivity to non-standard particle dark matter model</strong>, Euclid Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18274v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18274v1</a></p>

<p>The Euclid mission of the European Space Agency will provide weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering surveys that can be used to constrain the standard cosmological model and its extensions, with an opportunity to test the properties of dark matter beyond the minimal cold dark matter paradigm. We present forecasts from the combination of these surveys on the parameters describing four interesting and representative non-minimal dark matter models: a mixture of cold and warm dark matter relics; unstable dark matter decaying either into massless or massive relics; and dark matter experiencing feeble interactions with relativistic relics. We model these scenarios at the level of the non-linear matter power spectrum using emulators trained on dedicated N-body simulations. We use a mock Euclid likelihood to fit mock data and infer error bars on dark matter parameters marginalised over other parameters. We find that the Euclid photometric probe (alone or in combination with CMB data from the Planck satellite) will be sensitive to the effect of each of the four dark matter models considered here. The improvement will be particularly spectacular for decaying and interacting dark matter models. With Euclid, the bounds on some dark matter parameters can improve by up to two orders of magnitude compared to current limits. We discuss the dependence of predicted uncertainties on different assumptions: inclusion of photometric galaxy clustering data, minimum angular scale taken into account, modelling of baryonic feedback effects. We conclude that the Euclid mission will be able to measure quantities related to the dark sector of particle physics with unprecedented sensitivity. This will provide important information for model building in high-energy physics. Any hint of a deviation from the minimal cold dark matter paradigm would have profound implications for cosmology and particle physics.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Neutron Stars in Aether Scalar-Tensor Theory</strong>, Christopher Reyes et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18225v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18225v1</a></p>

<p>Aether Scalar-Tensor theory is a modification of general relativity proposed to explain galactic and cosmological mass discrepancies conventionally attributed to dark matter. The theory is able to fit the cosmic microwave background and the linear matter power spectrum without dark matter. In this work, we derive the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in this theory and solve it for realistic nuclear equations of state to predict the mass-radius relation of neutron stars. We find solutions that are compatible with all current observations of neutron stars.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>The impact of constrained interacting dark energy on the bound-zone velocity profile</strong>, Jounghun Lee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18210v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18210v1</a></p>

<p>We numerically study the effects of constrained interacting dark energy (CIDER) on the bound-zone velocity profiles around massive dark matter halos. Analyzing the CIDER simulations performed by Baldi (2023) for three different cases of dark sector coupling ($\beta=0.03$, $0.05$ and $0.08$) as well as for the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology ($\beta=0$), we determine the mean peculiar velocity profiles in the bound zones around the friends-of-friends halos with masses larger than $M_{\rm cut}=3\times 10^{13}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ at three redshifts, $z=0$, $0.5$ and $1$. It is found that the universal power-law formula proposed by Falco et al. (2024) originally for the $\Lambda$CDM case still describes well the bound-zone velocity profiles, $V(r)$, even in the CIDER models. The slope of $V(r)$, turns out to be significantly affected by the CIDER, progressively decreasing as $\beta$ increases. Meanwhile, the amplitude of $V(r)$ exhibits little dependence on $\beta$, which is ascribed to the identical Hubble parameters shared by the $\Lambda$CDM and CIDER models in the entire redshift range. Our results imply that the bound-zone velocity slope can break a degeneracy even between the $\Lambda$CDM and CIDER models with $\beta\le 0.03$, which the standard cosmological diagnostics fail to distinguish. We devise a simple analytic formula for the bound-zone slope as a function of $\beta$, and prove its validity at all of the three redshifts. It is concluded that the slope of the mean bound-zone peculiar velocity profile should be in principle a powerful probe of dark sector interaction.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Complex scalar dark matter in a new gauged U(1) symmetry with kinetic and direct mixings</strong>, Yu-Hang Su et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18170v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18170v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a scalar dark matter model featuring a hidden gauge symmetry, denoted as U(1)_X, with two complex scalars, Phi and S. In this framework, Phi spontaneously breaks the U(1)_X gauge symmetry, while S serves as a viable dark matter candidate. Particularly, the kinetic and direct mixings between the U(1)_X and U(1)_Y gauge groups provide a portal between dark matter and the Standard Model particles. These mixings offer a plausible explanation for the W boson mass anomaly observed by the CDF Collaboration. We study the comprehensive phenomenological constraints of this model from colliders and dark matter detection experiments, including Z’ searches at the LHC, the 125 GeV Higgs boson measurements, the relic density of dark matter and the indirect detection of dark matter annihilation. By randomly scanning the parameter space, we find that the regions where m_(Z’) &gt; 4750 GeV and m_(Z’) &lt; 4750 GeV for g_x close to 1 remain viable and can be tested by future experiments.</p>

<p>2024-06-25, <strong>Galactic Rotation Curves of LSB Galaxies using core-halo FDM configurations</strong>, Ivan Alvarez-Rios et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17984v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.17984v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we construct galactic halos in order to fit the rotation curves (RCs) of a sample of low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies. These halos are made of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) with a multimode expansion of non-spherical modes that in average contribute to the appropriate density profile consisting of a core and an envelope needed to fit the rotation curves. These halos are constructed assuming a solitonic core at the center and two types of envelopes, Navarro-Frenk-White and Pseudo-Isothermal density profiles. The resulting FDM configurations are then evolved in order to show how the average density changes in time due to the secular dynamical evolution, along with a condensation process that lead to the growth of the solitonic core.</p>

<p>(abridged) We analyze the emission of axion quark nuggets in a large sample of 161 simulated galaxy clusters using the SLOW simulation. These clusters are divided into a sub-sample of 150 galaxy clusters, ordered in five mass bins ranging from $0.8$ to $31.7 \times 10^{14} \,M_\odot$, along with 11 cross-identified galaxy clusters from observations. We investigate dark matter-baryonic matter interactions in galaxy clusters in their present stage at redshift $z=0$ by assuming all dark matter consists of axion quark nuggets. The resulting electromagnetic signatures are compared to thermal Bremsstrahlung and non-thermal cosmic ray synchrotron emission in each galaxy cluster. We further investigate individual frequency bands imitating the observable range of the WMAP, Planck, Euclid, and XRISM telescopes for the most promising cross-identified galaxy clusters hosting detectable signatures of axion quark nugget emission. We propose that the Fornax and Virgo clusters represent the most promising candidates to search for axion quark nugget emission signatures.</p>

<p>We study the out-of-equilibrium production of non-minimally coupled self-interacting scalar dark matter during reheating using classical lattice simulations. The outcomes of the classical simulations are in qualitative agreement with the previous results obtained using the quantum 2PI approach in the Hartree truncation. In particular, the novel non-linear resonance found in the 2PI Hartee study is present also in the classical lattice simulations and can dominate the final dark matter yield. For the parameters considered, the difference in final value of the scalar two-point function between the two approaches is a factor of O(1).</p>

<p>2024-06-25, <strong>An Alternative Channel to Black Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binaries: Dynamical Friction of Dark Matter?</strong>, Ke Qin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17209v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.17209v1</a></p>

<p>Both the anomalous magnetic braking of Ap/Bp stars and the surrounding circumbinary disk models can account for the formation of black hole (BH) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), while the simulated effective temperatures of the donor stars are significantly higher than the observed values. Therefore, the formation of BH LMXBs is not still completely understood. In this work, we diagnose whether the dynamical friction between dark matter and the companion stars can drive BH binaries to evolve toward the observed BH LMXBs and alleviate the effective temperature problem. Assuming that there exists a density spike of dark matter around BH, the dynamical friction can produce an efficient angular momentum loss, driving BH binaries with an intermediate-mass companion star to evolve into BH LMXBs for a spike index higher than $\gamma = 1.58$. Our detailed stellar evolution models show that the calculated effective temperatures can match the observed value of most BH LMXBs for a spike index range of $\gamma = 1.7-2.1$. However, the simulated mass-transfer rates when $\gamma = 2.0$ and $2.1$ are too high to be consistent with the observed properties that BH LMXBs appears as soft X-ray transients. Therefore, the dynamical friction of dark matter can only alleviate the effective temperature problem of those BH LMXBs with a relatively short orbital period.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>The aspherical explosions of the 03fg-like Type Ia supernovae 2021zny and 2022ilv revealed by polarimetry</strong>, T. Nagao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18110v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18110v1</a></p>

<p>A peculiar subtype of Type Ia supernovae (SNe), 03fg-like (super-Chandrasekhar) SNe, show different observational properties from prototypical Type Ia SNe, typically having high luminosity at the light-curve peak, low expansion velocities, and strong carbon features. The origin of this class of Type Ia SNe has been actively debated. Recent nebular-phase infrared observations of the 03fg-like Type Ia SN 2022pul using the James Webb Space Telescope revealed large-scale asymmetries in the ejecta and the presence of the strong [Ne II] line at 12.81 $\mu$m, suggesting a violent merger of two white dwarfs as its origin. Polarimetry is another powerful tool to study overall ejecta asymmetries of spatially-unresolved SNe. Here, we aim to check the universality of the violent merger scenario as the origin of the 03fg-like Type Ia SNe, by studying their explosion geometries using polarimetry. In this letter, we present imaging-polarimetric observations of the two 03fg-like Type Ia SNe 2021zny and 2022ilv. SNe 2021zny and 2022ilv show high intrinsic polarization ($\sim1$ % -$\sim2$ %), which might be composed of multiple components with different polarization angles. This indicates that they have complex aspherical structures in their ejecta, supporting the violent merger scenario for their origin. Our observations provide the first clear evidence from polarimetry for such aspherical structures.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Observational Evidence to Logistic Dark Energy Driving the Accelerating Universe</strong>, Sarath Nelleri et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18095v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18095v1</a></p>

<p>We present logistic dark energy model (LDEM), where the dark energy density follows a logistic function for the scale factor. The equation of state parameter of dark energy ($w_D$) transitioned from $-1$ in the distant past to its current value of $-0.76$, closely resembling the $\Lambda$CDM model in the early epoch and showing significant deviation in the late phase. The evolution of the deceleration parameter in the LDEM signifies its success in explaining the late-time cosmic acceleration. Model selection based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), incorporating observations from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), Observational Hubble data (OHD), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) strongly favors the LDEM over the conventional $\Lambda$CDM model, where BIC is estimated to be $\sim -20$. Incorporating the shift parameter derived from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data shows competing evidence of the LDEM over the standard $\Lambda$CDM. Remarkably, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) value computed using any of the datasets tends to align closely with the predictions from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), suggesting a need to reconsider the local measurement.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>NEOWISE-R Caught the Luminous SN 2023ixf in Messier 101</strong>, Schuyler D. Van Dyk et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18005v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18005v1</a></p>

<p>The reactivated Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE-R) serendipitously caught the Type II supernova SN 2023ixf in Messier 101 on the rise, starting day 3.6 through day 10.9, and on the late-time decline from days 211 through 213 and days 370 through 372. We have considered these mid-infrared (mid-IR) data together with observations from the ultraviolet (UV) through the near-IR, when possible. At day 3.6 we approximated the optical emission with a hot, ~26,630 K blackbody, with a notable UV excess likely from strong SN shock interaction with circumstellar matter (CSM). In the IR, however, a clear excess is also obvious, and we fit it with a cooler, ~1,620 K blackbody with radius of ~2.6 x 10^{15} cm, consistent with dust in the progenitor’s circumstellar shell likely heated by the UV emission from the CSM interaction. On day 10.8, the light detected was consistent with SN ejecta-dominated emission. At late times we also observed a clear NEOWISE-R excess, which could arise either from newly formed dust in the inner ejecta or in the contact discontinuity between the forward and reverse shocks, or from more distant pre-existing dust grains in the SN environment. Furthermore, the large 4.6 micron excess at late times can also be explained by the emergence of the carbon monoxide 1–0 vibrational band. SN 2023ixf is the best-observed SN IIP in the mid-IR during the first several days after explosion and one of the most luminous such SNe ever seen.</p>

<p>2024-06-25, <strong>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at low metallicity VIII. Stellar and wind parameters of newly revealed stripped stars in Be binaries</strong>, V. Ramachandran et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17678v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.17678v1</a></p>

<p>On the route towards merging neutron stars and stripped-envelope supernovae, binary population synthesis predicts a large number of post-interaction systems with massive stars that have stripped off their outer layers. Yet, observations of such stars in the intermediate-mass regime below the Wolf-Rayet masses are rare. Using X-Shooting ULLYSES (XShootU) data, we discovered three partially stripped star + Be/Oe binaries in the Magellanic Clouds. We analyzed the UV and optical spectra using the PoWR model atmosphere code by superimposing model spectra corresponding to each component. The estimated current masses of the partially stripped stars fall within the intermediate mass range of 4-8 $M_{\odot}$. These objects are overluminous for their stellar masses, matching core He-burning luminosities. Their Be/Oe secondaries have much higher masses than their stripped primaries (mass ratio &gt; 2). All three partially stripped stars show significant nitrogen enrichment and carbon and oxygen depletion on their surfaces. Additionally, one of our sample stars exhibits significant helium enrichment. Our study provides the first comprehensive determination of the wind parameters of partially stripped stars in the intermediate mass range. The wind mass-loss rates of these stars are found to be on the order of $10^{-7} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, which is over ten times higher than that of OB stars of the same luminosity. Current evolutionary models characterizing this phase typically employ OB or WR mass-loss rates, which underestimate or overestimate stripped stars’ mass-loss rates by an order of magnitude. Binary evolution models indicate that the observed primaries had initial masses of 12-17 $M_{\odot}$, making them potential candidates for stripped-envelope supernovae that form neutron stars. If they survive the explosion, these systems may become Be X-ray binaries and later double neutron stars.</p>

<p>2024-06-25, <strong>A look at the high energy aspects of the supernova remnant G309.8+00.0 with eROSITA and Fermi-LAT</strong>, Miltiadis Michailidis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17493v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.17493v1</a></p>

<p>Supernova remnant (SNR) detection along the Galactic plane poses a number of challenges. The SNR G309.8+00.0 lies exactly on the Galactic plane, with its center coinciding with galactic latitude (b)=0 deg. In this paper we report the first detection of the SNR G309.8+00.0 in X-rays and $\gamma$ rays, using stacked data from the first four consecutive extended ROentgen Survey Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) – on board the Russian-German Spektrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) – all-sky surveys (eRASS:4) and $\sim15.5$ yr of Pass 8 data recorded from Fermi-LAT, respectively. The SNR appears to have an elliptical shape of 0.43 x 0.32 deg in size in both radio synchrotron and X-ray data. The SNR’s emission exhibits a shell-like morphology and good spatial correlation in both energy bands. The X-ray emission was solely detected in the 1-2 keV energy band (subject to strong absorption at soft X-rays) and the spectral analysis results of eRASS:4 data present a purely thermal SNR with a high absorption column density $3.1_{-0.5}^{+0.7}\cdot10^{22}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of $0.34\pm0.1$ keV. In combination with optical extinction data, the absorption column density values derived from the remnant’s spectral analysis support a remnant’s distance greater than 6 kpc, rather than a 3.12 kpc distance as reported in the literature, and yield an age of $1-3.5\cdot10^5$ yr. Employing $\sim15.5$ yr of Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray data at and around the remnant’s vicinity, we confirm the detection of the to-date unidentified 4FGL J1349.5-6206c source that can either be modeled as a single source or a conglomerate of multiple distinct source components and we argue that the SNR G309.8+00.0 likely represents at least a significant portion (if not all) of the emission from the 4FGL J1349.5-6206c $\gamma$-ray source.</p>

<p>With the number of supernovae observed expected to drastically increase thanks to large-scale surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), it is necessary that the tools we use to classify these objects keep up with this increase. We previously created Supernova Tagging and Classification (STag) to address this problem by employing machine learning techniques alongside logistic regression in order to assign ‘tags’ to spectra based on spectral features. STag II is a continuation of this work, which now makes use of model supernova spectra combined with real DESI spectra in order to train STag to better deal with realistic data. We also make use of the rlap score as a trustworthiness cut, making for a more robust and accurate supernova classifier than before.</p>

<p>2024-06-25, <strong>Hybrid isentropic twin stars</strong>, Juan Pablo Carlomagno et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17193v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.17193v1</a></p>

<p>We present a study of hybrid neutron stars with color superconducting quark matter cores at finite temperature that results in sequences of stars with constant entropy per baryon, $s/n_B={\rm const}$. For the quark matter equation of state, we employ a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model while nuclear matter is described with a relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class. The phase transition is obtained by a Maxwell construction under isothermal conditions. We find that traversing the mixed phase on a trajectory at low $s/n_B\lesssim 2$ in the phase diagram shows a heating effect while at larger $s/n_B$ the temperature drops. This behavior may be attributed to the presence of a color superconducting quark matter phase at low temperatures and the melting of the diquark condensate which restores the normal quark matter phase at higher temperatures. While the isentropic hybrid star branch at low $s/n_B\lesssim 2$ is connected to the neutron star branch, it gets disconnected at higher entropy per baryon so that the “thermal twin” phenomenon is observed. We find that the transition from connected to disconnected hybrid star sequences may be estimated with the Seidov criterion for the difference in energy densities. The radii and masses at the onset of deconfinement exhibit a linear relationship and thus define a critical compactness of the isentropic star configuration for which the transition occurs which for large enough $s/n_B\gtrsim 2$ is accompanied by an instability. The results of this study may be of relevance for uncovering the conditions for the supernova explodability of massive blue supergiant stars by the quark deconfinement mechanism. The accretion-induced deconfinement transition with thermal twin formation may contribute to explaining the origin of eccentric orbits in some binary systems and the origin of isolated millisecond pulsars.</p>
