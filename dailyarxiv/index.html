<p>2024-08-15, <strong>Hydrostatic equilibrium of X-ray gas in HMG: four representative cases</strong>, Robert Monjo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08102v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.08102v1</a></p>

<p>Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) was originally proposed to model galaxy rotation curves without dark matter. However, MOND presents difficulties in explaining the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) observed in galaxy clusters, and moreover, it does not completely eliminate the need for dark matter, since it requires using sterile neutrinos to explain the observed hydrostatic equilibrium of the hot gas. Hyperconical Modified Gravity (HMG) offers a relativistic framework that recovers the success of MOND in galaxy rotation curves as a natural particular case, and it could potentially reconcile the above discrepancies without invoking any type of dark matter. This Letter analyses the performance of the HMG model for hydrostatic equilibrium in four representative systems: groups of NGC 533 and NGC 5044 galaxies, and clusters of Abell 2717 and Abell 2029. Specifically, we used high-resolution X-ray data with which gas density, temperature, and mass profiles were previously derived to constrain modified gravity models. Our results show that the hydrostatic equilibrium in the four systems is naturally adjusted to the HMG model without the need for fitting parameters or adding sterile neutrinos, which are required for MOND theories.</p>

<p>2024-08-15, <strong>Photon Frequency Conversion in High-$Q$ Superconducting Resonators: Axion Electrodynamics, QED &amp; Nonlinear Meissner Radiation</strong>, Hikaru Ueki et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08275v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.08275v1</a></p>

<p>High-Q superconducting resonators have been proposed and developed as detectors of light-by-light scattering mediated by the hypothesized axion or virtual electron-positron pairs in quantum electrodynamics - the Euler-Heisenberg (EH) interaction. Photon frequency and mode conversion is central to the scheme for detecting such rare events. Superconducting resonators are nonlinear devices. The Meissner screening currents that confine the electromagnetic fields to the vacuum region of a superconducting RF cavity are nonlinear functions of the EM field at the vacuum-superconducting interface, and as a result can generate source currents and frequency conversion of microwave photons in the cavity. In this report we consider photon frequency and mode conversion in superconducting resonators with high quality factors from Meissner currents in single and dual cavity setups proposed for axion and QED searches based on light-by-light scattering. In a single cavity with two pump modes photon frequency conversion by the Meissner screening current dominates photon generation by the EH interaction for cavities with $Q \lesssim 10^{12}$. The Meissner currents also generate background photons that limits the operation of the resonator for axion detection in three-mode, single cavity setups. We also consider the leakage of photons from pump modes into the signal mode for both axion and EH mediated light-by-light scattering. Photon frequency conversion by the EH interaction can compete with Meissner and leakage radiation in \emph{ultra-high-Q} cavities that are beyond current state of the art. Meissner radiation and leakage backgrounds can be suppressed in dual cavity setups with appropriate choices for pump and spectator modes, as well as the single-cavity setup proposed for heterodyne detection of galactic axion dark matter.</p>

<p>2024-08-15, <strong>Constraining Ultralight ALP Dark Matter in Light of Cosmic Birefringence</strong>, Dongdong Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08063v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.08063v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmic birefringence, the observed rotation of the polarization plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), serves as a compelling probe for parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model. This study explores the potential of ultralight axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter to explain the observed cosmic birefringence in the CMB. We focus on the previously understudied mass range of $10^{-25}$ eV to $10^{-23}$ eV, where ALPs start to undergo nonlinear clustering in the late universe. Our analysis incorporates recent cosmological constraints and considers the washout effect on CMB polarization. We find that for models with ALP masses $10^{-25}$ eV $\lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-23}$ eV and birefringence arising from late ALP clustering, the upper limit on the ALP-photon coupling constant, imposed by the washout effect, is stringently lower than the coupling required to account for the observed static cosmic birefringence signal. This discrepancy persists regardless of the ALP fraction in dark matter. Furthermore, considering ALPs with masses $m_\phi\gtrsim$ $10^{-23}$ eV cannot explain static birefringence due to their rapid field oscillations, our results indicate that, all ALP dark matter candidates capable of nonlinear clustering in the late universe and thus contributing mainly to the rotation angle of polarized photons, are incompatible with explaining the static cosmic birefringence signal observed in Planck and WMAP data.</p>

<p>2024-08-15, <strong>Combined search in dwarf spheroidal galaxies for branon dark matter annihilation signatures with the MAGIC telescopes</strong>, MAGIC Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08009v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.08009v1</a></p>

<p>Massive brane fluctuations, called branons, behave as weakly interacting massive particles, which is one of the most favored class of candidates to fulfill the role of the dark matter (DM), an elusive kind of matter beyond the Standard Model. We present a multi-target search in dwarf spheroidal galaxies for branon DM annihilation signatures with a total exposure of 354 hours with the ground-based gamma-ray telescope system MAGIC. This search led to the most constraining limits on branon DM in the sub-TeV and multi-TeV DM mass range. Our most stringent limit on the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section (at $95\%$ confidence level) corresponds to $ \langle \sigma v \rangle \simeq 1.9 \times 10^{-24}{\text{cm}^{3}\text{s}^{-1}} $ at a branon mass of $ \sim 1.5~\text{TeV}$.</p>

<p>2024-08-15, <strong>Radio Proper Motions and a Search for the Origin of PSR B1849+00</strong>, Luis F. Rodriguez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08278v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.08278v1</a></p>

<p>Until now it has not been possible to obtain the proper motions of PSR B1849+00 with timing techniques or VLBI imaging given the enhanced interstellar scattering along its line of sight. We present an analysis of archive Very Large Array observations at epochs from 2012 to 2022 that indicates a total proper motion of 23.9$\pm$5.5 mas yr$^{-1}$ toward the southwest. After correction for the proper motions produced by galactic rotation, we find a peculiar transverse velocity of $\simeq$740 km s$^{-1}$. We searched unsuccessfully along the past trajectory of the pulsar for an associated supernova remnant. In particular, W44 is in this trajectory but its distance is different to that of PSR B1849+00.</p>

<p>2024-08-15, <strong>New radio continuum study of the Large Magellanic Cloud Supernova Remnant N49</strong>, M. Ghavam et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07924v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.07924v1</a></p>

<p>We present new Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) radio observations toward N49, one of the brightest extragalactic Supernova remnants (SNRs) located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our new and archival ATCA radio observations were analysed along with $Chandra$ X-ray data. These observations show a prominent `bullet’ shaped feature beyond the southwestern boundary of the SNR. Both X-ray morphology and radio polarisation analysis support a physical connection of this feature to the SNR. The ‘bullet’ feature’s apparent velocity is estimated at $\sim$1300 km s$^{-1}$, based on its distance ($\sim$10 pc) from the remnant’s geometric centre and estimated age ($\sim$7600 yrs). we estimated the radio spectral index, $\alpha= -0.55 \pm 0.03$ which is typical of middle-age SNRs. Polarisation maps created for N49 show low to moderate levels of mean fractional polarisation estimated at 7$\pm$1% and 10$\pm$1% for 5.5 and 9 GHz, respectively. These values are noticeably larger than found in previous studies. Moreover, the mean value for the Faraday rotation of SNR N49 from combining CABB data is 212$\pm$65 rad m$^{-2}$ and the maximum value of RM is 591$\pm$103 rad m$^{-2}$.</p>

<p>2024-08-15, <strong>Citizen ASAS-SN Data Release II: Variable Star Classification Using Citizen Science</strong>, O. Kotrach et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07859v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.07859v1</a></p>

<p>We present the second results from Citizen ASAS-SN, a citizen science project for the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) hosted on the Zooniverse platform. Citizen ASAS-SN tasks users with classifying variable stars based on their light curves. We started with 94975 new variable candidates and identified 4432 new variable stars. The users classified the new variables as 841 pulsating variables, 2995 rotational variables, 350 eclipsing binaries, and 246 unknown variables. We found 68% user agreement for user-classified pulsating variables, 51% for rotational variables, and 77% for eclipsing binaries. We investigate user statistics and compare new variables to known variables. We present a sample of variables flagged as interesting or unusual.</p>
