<p>2023-08-16, <strong>Performance Studies of the Acoustic Module for the IceCube Upgrade</strong>, Charlotte Benning et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08506v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.08506v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Upgrade will augment the existing IceCube Neutrino Observatory by deploying 700 additional optical sensor modules and calibration devices within its center at a depth of 1.5 to 2.5 km in the Antarctic ice. One goal of the Upgrade is to improve the positioning calibration of the optical sensors to increase the angular resolution for neutrino directional reconstruction. An acoustic calibration system will be deployed to explore the capability of achieving this using trilateration of propagation times of acoustic signals. Ten Acoustic Modules (AM) capable of sending and receiving acoustic signals with frequencies from 5 to 30 kHz will be installed within the detector volume. Additionally, compact acoustic sensors inside 15 optical sensor modules will complement the acoustic calibration system. With this system, we aim for an accuracy of a few tens of cm to localize the Acoustic Modules and sensors. Due to the longer attenuation length of sound compared to light within the ice, acoustic position calibration is especially interesting for the upcoming IceCube-Gen2 detector, which will have a string spacing of around 240 m. In this contribution we present an overview of the technical design of the Acoustic Module as well as results of performance tests with a first complete prototype.</p>

<p>2023-08-15, <strong>Analytic and Parameter-Free Formula for the Neutrino Mixing Matrix</strong>, Bodo Lampe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08498v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.08498v1</a></p>

<p>A parameter-free analytic expression for the PMNS matrix is derived which fits numerically all the measured matrix components to within 1 or 2 standard deviations. Results are proven within the microscopic model and also lead to a prediction of the leptonic Jarlskog invariant $J_{PMNS}=-0.0106$. An outlook is given to the treatment of the CKM matrix.</p>

<p>2023-08-16, <strong>Comments on “On the Dirac-Majorana neutrinos distinction in four-body decays” (arXiv:2305.14140 [hep-ph])</strong>, C. S. Kim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08464v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.08464v1</a></p>

<p>In arXiv:2305.14140 [hep-ph] the authors analyze the radiative leptonic decay $\ell^- \to \nu_\ell \, \overline{\nu}_{\ell’} \, \ell^{\prime -} \, \gamma$ to distinguish between Dirac and Majorana nature of neutrinos. They utilize the back-to-back kinematics for this purpose, a special kinematic configuration which we first proposed in our paper arXiv:2106.11785 [hep-ph]. However, their analysis suffers from two fundamental issues: (1) anti-symmetrization of their amplitude and (2) their study of the special back-to-back configuration. This makes their conclusion and comments invalid and untenable.</p>

<p>2023-08-16, <strong>Neutrinos and Asteroseismology of Stars over the Helium Flash</strong>, Diogo Capelo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08282v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.08282v1</a></p>

<p>The helium flash, occurring in stars of 0.6-2.0 M$_\odot$ at the end of the red giant branch, is not observable via optical means due to the energy of the process being used to lift the core out of degeneracy. Neutrinos, which are linked to the ignition of reactions triggered during the flash and serve as the only cooling process in the inert core, can help characterize changes in internal structure. In this work, we create 18 stellar models across three mass and six metallicity values, chosen in the context of the stellar abundance problem, to compare the evolutionary path up to and probe the helium flash by conducting a detailed study of neutrino emission throughout this crucial phase of stellar evolution. We demonstrate how thermal neutrino emissions could have an imprint on global asteroseismic parameters and use them as an additional tool to infer the impact of compositional changes. We find that a precision of 0.3 $\mu$Hz in the determination of $\Delta \nu$ is enough to distinguish between between the two most prominent solar composition models and confirm that asteroseismic observation can be enough to classify a star as undergoing the process of helium subflashes. We also predict nuclear neutrino emission fluxes and their evolution for all relevant sources.</p>

<p>2023-08-16, <strong>Chiral kinetic theory with self-energy corrections and neutrino spin Hall effect</strong>, Naoki Yamamoto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08257v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.08257v1</a></p>

<p>We systematically derive the chiral kinetic theory for chiral fermions with collisions, including the self-energy corrections, from quantum field theories. We find that the Wigner functions and chiral kinetic equations receive both the classical and quantum corrections from the self-energies and their spacetime gradients. We also apply this formalism to study non-equilibrium neutrino transport due to the interaction with thermalized electrons, as realized in core-collapse supernovae. We derive neutrino currents along magnetic fields and neutrino spin Hall effect induced by temperature and chemical potential gradients of electrons at first order in the Fermi constant $G_{\rm F}$ for anisotropic neutrino distributions.</p>

<p>2023-08-16, <strong>Galactic and Extragalactic Analysis of the Astrophysical Muon Neutrino Flux with 12.3 years of IceCube Track Data</strong>, Philipp Fürst et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08233v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.08233v1</a></p>

<p>The Ice Cube Neutrino Observatory has been measuring an isotropic astrophysical neutrino flux in multiple detection channels for almost a decade. Galactic diffuse emission, which arises from the interactions between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium, is an expected signal in IceCube. The superposition of an extragalactic flux and a galactic flux results in directional structure and variations in the spectrum. In this work, we use 12.3 years of high-purity muon-neutrino induced muon track data to perform a dedicated search for this galactic emission, combined with a spectral measurement of the isotropic astrophysical neutrino flux. To distinguish a galactic component from the dominant atmospheric and isotropic astrophysical components, the precise directional information available for muon tracks is fully utilized in a three-dimensional forward folding likelihood fit. We test a state-of-the-art model prediction of galactic diffuse emission based on recent cosmic ray data (CRINGE). We fit this prediction as a template scaled by a factor $\Psi_{\mathrm{CRINGE}}$, and find $2.9\pm 1.1 \times \Psi_{\mathrm{CRINGE}}$ with a significance of $2.7\sigma$ in an energy range between 400 GeV and 60 TeV in the Northern Sky.</p>

<p>2023-08-16, <strong>Effect of Spin-Dependent Short-Range Correlations on Nuclear Matrix Elements for Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay of $^{48}$Ca</strong>, S. Sarkar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08216v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.08216v1</a></p>

<p>The neutrinoless double beta decay is a pivotal weak nuclear process that holds the potential to unveil the Majorana nature of neutrinos and predict their absolute masses. In this study, we delve into examining the impact of spin-dependent short-range correlations (SRC) on the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for the light neutrino-exchange mechanism in neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay of $^{48}$Ca, employing an extensive interacting nuclear shell model. All computations are performed employing the effective shell model Hamiltonian GXPF1A, encompassing the entire $fp$ model space through the closure approximation. Our investigation examines the NMEs’ dependencies on factors such as the number of intermediate states, coupled spin-parity attributes of neutrons and protons, neutrino momentum, inter-nucleon separation, and closure energy. This scrutiny is performed with respect to both the conventional Jastrow-type approach of SRC, employing various parameterizations, and the spin-dependent SRC paradigm. Our findings illuminate a discernible distinction in NMEs induced by spin-dependent SRC, differing by approximately 10-20\% from those computed through the conventional Jastrow-type SRC, incorporating distinct parameterizations.</p>

<p>2023-08-15, <strong>IceCube experience using XRootD-based Origins with GPU workflows in PNRP</strong>, David Schultz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07999v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07999v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic kilometer neutrino telescope located at the geographic South Pole. Understanding detector systematic effects is a continuous process. This requires the Monte Carlo simulation to be updated periodically to quantify potential changes and improvements in science results with more detailed modeling of the systematic effects. IceCube’s largest systematic effect comes from the optical properties of the ice the detector is embedded in. Over the last few years there have been considerable improvements in the understanding of the ice, which require a significant processing campaign to update the simulation. IceCube normally stores the results in a central storage system at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but it ran out of disk space in 2022. The Prototype National Research Platform (PNRP) project thus offered to provide both GPU compute and storage capacity to IceCube in support of this activity. The storage access was provided via XRootD-based OSDF Origins, a first for IceCube computing. We report on the overall experience using PNRP resources, with both successes and pain points.</p>

<p>2023-08-15, <strong>Cosmological Implications of Gauged $U(1)<em>{B-L}$ on $ΔN</em>{\rm eff}$ in the CMB and BBN</strong>, Haidar Esseili et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07955v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07955v1</a></p>

<p>We calculate the effects of a light, very weakly-coupled boson $X$ arising from a spontaneously broken $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ as measured by the CMB and $Y_p$ from BBN. Our focus is the mass range $1 \; {\rm eV} \lesssim m_X \lesssim 100 \; {\rm MeV}$; masses lighter than about an ${\rm eV}$ have strong constraints from fifth-force law constraints, while masses heavier than about $100$~MeV are constrained by other probes. We do not assume $X$ began in thermal equilibrium with the SM; instead, we allow $X$ to freeze-in from its very weak interactions with the SM. We find $U(1)_{B-L}$ is more strongly constrained by $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ than previously considered. The bounds arise from the energy density in electrons and neutrinos slowly siphoned off into $X$ bosons, which become nonrelativistic, redshift as matter, and then decay, dumping their slightly larger energy density back into the SM bath causing $\Delta N_{\rm eff} &gt; 0$. While some of the parameter space has complementary constraints from stellar cooling, supernova emission, and terrestrial experiments, we find future CMB observatories can access regions of mass and coupling space not probed by any other method. In gauging $U(1)_{B-L}$, we assume the $[U(1)_{B-L}]^3$ anomaly is canceled by right-handed neutrinos, and so our $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ calculations have been carried out in two scenarios: neutrinos have Dirac masses, or, right-handed neutrinos acquire Majorana masses. In the latter scenario, we comment on the additional implications of thermalized right-handed neutrinos decaying during BBN. We also briefly consider the possibility that $X$ decays into dark sector states. If these states behave as radiation, we find weaker constraints, whereas if they are massive, there are stronger constraints, though now from $\Delta N_{\rm eff} &lt; 0$.</p>

<p>2023-08-15, <strong>Renormalization of a Standard Model Extension with a Dark Abelian Sector and Predictions for the W-Boson Mass</strong>, Stefan Dittmaier et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07845v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07845v1</a></p>

<p>The described Dark Abelian Sector Model (DASM) extends the Standard Model (SM) by a ``dark’’ sector containing a spontaneously broken $U(1)_\text{d}$ gauge group. Keeping this dark sector quite generic we only add one additional Higgs boson, one Dirac fermion, and right-handed SM-like neutrinos to the SM. Using the only two singlet operators of the SM with dimension less than 4 (the $U(1)_\text{Y}$ field-strength tensor and the SM Higgs mass operator $|\Phi|^2$) as well as the right-handed neutrino fields we open up three portals to the dark sector. Dark sectors, such as the one of the DASM, that introduce an additional Higgs boson $\text{H}$ as well as an additional $\text{Z}’$ gauge boson can have a large influence on the predictions for electroweak precision observables and even accommodate possible dark matter candidates. We consider one of the two Higgs bosons to be the known $125\,\text{GeV}$ Higgs boson and parameterize the extension of the scalar sector by the mass of the second Higgs boson, the Higgs mixing angle, and a Higgs self-coupling. We do not assume any mass hierarchy in the gauge sector and use the mass of the additional $\text{Z}’$ boson and a corresponding gauge-boson mixing angle to parameterize the extension of the gauge sector. The fermion sector is parameterized by the mass of the additional fermion and a fermion mixing angle. We describe an on-shell as well as an $\overline{\text{MS}}$ renormalization scheme for the DASM sectors and give explicit results for the renormalization constants at the 1-loop level, and, thus, prepare the ground for full NLO predictions for collider observables in the DASM. As a first example, we provide the DASM prediction for the W-boson mass derived from muon decay.</p>

<p>2023-08-15, <strong>Joint measurement of the ultra-high-energy neutrino spectrum and cross section</strong>, Victor B. Valera et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07709v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07709v1</a></p>

<p>Soon, a new generation of neutrino telescopes, presently under planning, will target the discovery of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos of cosmic origin, with energies higher than 100 PeV, that promise unique insight into astrophysics and particle physics. Yet, predictions of the UHE neutrino flux and interaction cross section – whose measurement is co-dependent – are laden with significant uncertainty that, if unaddressed, could misrepresent the capabilities to measure one or the other. To address this, we advocate for the joint measurement of the UHE neutrino spectrum and neutrino-nucleon cross section, including of their energy dependence, without assuming prior knowledge of either. We illustrate our methods by adopting empirical parametrizations of the neutrino spectrum, in forecasts geared to the planned radio array of the IceCube-Gen2 neutrino telescope. We warn against using simple parametrizations – a simple power law or one augmented with an exponential cut-off – that might fail to capture features of the spectrum that are commonplace in the predictions. We argue instead for the use of flexible parametrizations – a piecewise power law or an interpolating polynomial – that ensure accuracy. We report loose design targets for the detector energy and angular resolution that are compatible with those under present consideration.</p>

<p>2023-08-15, <strong>Search for Extremely High Energy Neutrinos with IceCube</strong>, Maximilian Meier et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07656v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07656v1</a></p>

<p>Extremely high energy (EHE) neutrinos (with energies above $10^7$ GeV) are produced in interactions of the highest energy cosmic rays. A primary contribution to the EHE neutrino flux is expected from so-called cosmogenic neutrinos produced when ultra high energy cosmic rays interact with ambient photon backgrounds. Observations of these EHE neutrinos with IceCube can probe the nature of cosmic rays beyond the energies for resonant photo-pion production (GZK cutoff). We present a new event selection of extremely high energy neutrinos by more effectively identifying and rejecting high multiplicity muon bundles with respect to previous analyses. Furthermore, we show the expected improvements of the quasi-differential upper limits on the EHE neutrino flux using 12 years of IceCube data.</p>

<p>2023-08-15, <strong>Multiwavelength Observations of the Blazar PKS~0735+178 in Spatial and Temporal Coincidence with an Astrophysical Neutrino Candidate IceCube-211208A</strong>, M. Pohl et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07643v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07643v1</a></p>

<p>We report on multiwavelength target-of-opportunity observations of the blazar PKS 0735+178, located 2.2 degrees away from the best-fit position of the IceCube neutrino event 211208A. The source was in a high-flux state in the optical, ultraviolet, X-ray, and GeV gamma-ray bands around the time of the neutrino event, exhibiting daily variability in the soft X-ray flux. The X-ray data from Swift-XRT and NuSTAR characterize the transition between the low-energy and high-energy components of the broadband spectral energy distribution, and the gamma-ray data from Fermi-LAT, VERITAS, and H.E.S.S. require a spectral cut-off near 100 GeV. Both measurements provide strong constraints on leptonic and hadronic models. We analytically explore a synchrotron self-Compton model, an external Compton model, and a lepto-hadronic model. Models that are entirely based on internal photon fields face serious difficulties in matching the observed spectral energy distribution (SED). The existence of an external photon field in the source would instead explain the observed gamma-ray spectral cut-off in both leptonic and lepto-hadronic models, and it would allow a proton jet power that marginally agrees with the Eddington limit in the lepto-hadronic model. A numerical lepto-hadronic model with external target photons reproduces the observed SED and is reasonably consistent with the neutrino event despite requiring a high jet power.</p>

<p>2023-08-15, <strong>Sensitivity to CP Discovery in the Presence of Lorentz Invariance Violating Potential at T2HK/T2HKK</strong>, Supriya Pan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07566v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07566v1</a></p>

<p>Investigation of conservation/violation of CP symmetry in the leptonic sector is very essential in understanding the evolution of the universe. Lorentz invariance and CPT are fundamental symmetries of nature. The violation of Lorentz invariance can also lead to CPT violations. The standard three flavour neutrino oscillation framework presents a scenario to observe the signature of Lorentz invariance and CP violations. This work focuses on the effect of Lorentz invariance violating (LIV) parameters on the sensitivity to CP violation. We investigate the sensitivity in two proposed configurations of the upcoming T2HK experiment: (i) one detector each placed at 295 km and 1100 km, and (ii) two identical detectors at 295 km. This study probes the effect of CPT violating parameters $a_{e\mu},a_{e\tau},a_{\mu\tau}$.</p>

<p>2023-08-16, <strong>Detecting Ultra-light Dark Matter with Stimulated Annihilation</strong>, Yuanlin Gong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08477v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.08477v1</a></p>

<p>Ultra-light Dark Matter (ULDM) is one of the most promising DM candidates. In the presence of background photon radiation, the annihilation rate of the ULDM can be greatly enhanced due to the Bose enhancement. We propose to utilize such stimulated annihilation to probe the ULDM by emitting a beam of radio into the space. This could lead to a distinctive reflected electromagnetic wave with an angular frequency equal to the ULDM mass. We show that low-frequency radio telescopes, such as LOFAR, UTR-2 and ngBOLO, can offer a new avenue of detecting this signal, especially for the Earth halo model. With a power of 50 MW emitter, the expected limits could be several orders of magnitude stronger than that from Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) in the ULDM mass $m_\phi$ range, $2.07 \times 10^{-8}\mathrm{~eV} \sim 4.5 \times 10^{-8}\mathrm{~eV}$.</p>

<p>We study the simultaneous decay of global string loops into scalar particles (massless and massive modes) and gravitational waves (GWs). Using field theory simulations in flat space-time of %isolated loops with initial length $\sim 80-1700$ times their core width, we determine the power emitted by a loop into scalar particles, $P_{\varphi}$, and GWs, $P_{\rm GW}$, and characterize the loop-decay timescale as a function of its initial length, energy and angular momentum. We quantify infrared and ultraviolet lattice dependencies of our results. For all type of loops and initial conditions considered, GW emission is always suppressed compared to particles as $P_{\rm GW}/P_{\varphi} \approx \mathcal{O}(10)(v/m_\text{p})^2\ll 1$, where $v$ is the vacuum expectation value associated with string formation. Our results suggest that the GW background from a global string network, such as in dark matter axion scenarios, will be highly suppressed.</p>

<p>Galaxy rotation curve (RC) fitting is an important technique which allows the placement of constraints on different kinds of dark matter (DM) halo models. In the case of non-phenomenological DM profiles with no analytic expressions, the art of finding RC best-fits including the full baryonic $+$ DM free parameters can be difficult and time-consuming. In the present work, we use a gradient descent method used in the backpropagation process of training a neural network, to fit the so-called Grand Rotation Curve of the Milky Way (MW) ranging from $\sim$1 pc all the way to $\sim$$10^5$ pc. We model the mass distribution of our Galaxy including a bulge (inner $+$ main), a disk, and a fermionic dark matter (DM) halo known as the Ruffini-Arg"uelles-Rueda (RAR) model. This is a semi-analytical model built from first-principle physics such as (quantum) statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, whose more general density profile has a dense core – diluted halo morphology with no analytic expression. As shown recently and further verified here, the dark and compact fermion-core can work as an alternative to the central black hole in SgrA* when including data at milliparsec scales from the S-cluster stars. Thus, we show the ability of this state-of-the-art machine learning tool in providing the best-fit parameters to the overall MW RC in the $10^{-2}$–$10^5$ pc range, in a few hours of CPU time.</p>

<p>2023-08-16, <strong>A radio-frequency WIMP search with the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey</strong>, Natasha Lavis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08351v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.08351v1</a></p>

<p>Radio-frequency, indirect dark matter searches have recently been gaining prevalence, due to the high sensitivity and resolution capabilities of the new generation of radio interferometers. MeerKAT is currently one of the most sensitive instruments of its kind, making it ideal for indirect dark matter searches. By making use of publicly available data from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey we are able to use both the observed diffuse synchrotron emission and non-detections to constrain the WIMP dark matter parameter space. In addition to a subset of generic WIMP annihilation channels, we probe the dark matter candidate within the 2HDM+S particle physics model, which was developed as an explanation for anomalies observed in the Large Hadron Collider data from runs 1 and 2. By undertaking a statistical analysis of the radio flux densities within galaxy clusters we are able to exclude the thermal relic value for WIMP masses $&lt; \, \sim 800 $ GeV for annihilation into bottom quarks. This is competitive with the best constraints in the current literature.</p>

<p>We show the first results of a new cavity based haloscope searching for dark photons with masses around $34~\mu\text{eV}$. Dark photons are hypothetical vector particles and a compelling dark matter candidate. Having the same quantum numbers as photons a kinematic mixing between both is expected, leading to conversions from dark photons to standard model photons, where the photon frequency depends on the dark photon mass. For wavelengths in the microwave regime resonators are typically used to enhance the signal. A new experiment is setup at the University of Mainz. In this paper we present the initial results from the new setup searching for dark photons utilising a 8.3 GHz copper cavity at LHe temperatures. Limits on the kinetic mixing parameter $\chi &lt; (6.20 \pm 3.15^\text{(exp.)} \pm 9.65^\text{(SG)}) \cdot 10^{-14}$ at 95\% CL are set at a single frequency as proof of concept. Finally the next steps of the experiment and expected sensitivity are detailed.</p>

<p>Dual-phase liquid-xenon time projection chambers (LXe TPCs) deploying a few tonnes of liquid are presently leading the search for WIMP dark matter. Scaling these detectors to 10-fold larger fiducial masses, while improving their sensitivity to low-mass WIMPs presents difficult challenges in detector design. Several groups are considering a departure from current schemes, towards either single-phase liquid-only TPCs, or dual-phase detectors where the electroluminescence region consists of patterned electrodes. Here, we discuss the possible use of Thick Gaseous Electron Multipliers (THGEMs) coated with a VUV photocathode and immersed in LXe as a building block in such designs. We focus on the transfer efficiencies of ionization electrons and photoelectrons emitted from the photocathode through the electrode holes, and show experimentally that efficiencies approaching 100 % can be achieved with realistic voltage settings. The observed voltage dependence of the transfer efficiencies is consistent with electron transport simulations once diffusion and charging-up effects are included.</p>

<p>GRDzhadzha is an open-source code for relativistic simulations of matter fields on curved spacetimes that admit an analytic description (e.g. stationary black holes). It is based on the publicly available 3+1D numerical relativity code GRChombo. Such a description is valid where the density of the matter is small compared to the curvature scale of the spacetime, which is the case for many physical scenarios - for example, dark matter environments. The approach offers significant savings on memory and speed compared to running full numerical relativity simulations, since the metric variables and their derivatives are calculated analytically, and therefore are not evolved or stored on the grid. This brief paper introduces the code and gives details of some applications for which it has already been used.</p>

<p>2023-08-16, <strong>Hidden Sector Dark Matter Arising from Breaking of $i \leftrightarrow -i$ Symmetry into Higgs Phases with Nonzero and Zero Higgs Vacuum Expectation</strong>, Stephen L. Adler et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08107v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.08107v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a scenario, motivated by but not exclusive to trace dynamics, in which emergent quantum theory takes the form of two sectors coupled gravitationally (or very weakly at some high unification scale), one sector with complex unit $i$ and the other sector with complex unit $-i$. I postulate that as a result of symmetries of the pre-quantum theory, in the absence of coupling the two sectors both have Higgs potentials that lie precisely at the boundary between phases with nonzero and zero Higgs vaccum expectation. Turning on the coupling between the two sectors can break the degeneracy, pushing the Higgs potential in one sector into the domain of nonzero Higgs expectation (giving the visible sector), and pushing the Higgs potential in the other sector into the domain of zero Higgs expectation (giving the dark sector). The least massive baryon in the dark sector will then be a candidate self-interacting dark matter particle.</p>

<p>2023-08-16, <strong>Slow diffusion around pulsar $γ$-ray halos and its impact on cosmic rays propagation</strong>, Xiao-Jun Bi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08099v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.08099v1</a></p>

<p>The diffusion coefficients around the pulsar $\gamma$-ray halos are highly suppressed compared with the value in the interstellar medium. It is suggested in the literature that the $\gamma$-ray halos can be explained by a ballistic-diffusive (BD) propagation without slow diffusion. However our calculation shows that the BD propagation can not account for the $\gamma$-ray halo profile well. Furthermore the transfer efficiency of the pulsar spin down energy to the high energy electrons and positrons is even larger than 1 in the BD scenario. Therefore slow diffusion is necessary to account for the pulsar $\gamma$-ray halos. Taking the slow diffusion into account the contribution of positron flux originated from nearby pulsars to the AMS-02 data is reexamined. We may also expect a slow diffusion disk of the Milky Way as many such slow diffusion regions exist. The positron contribution to the AMS-02 data from dark matter annihilation in the new propagation model is also reexamined. We find that the dark matter scenario satisfies all the $\gamma$-ray limits in the new propagation model.</p>

<p>2023-08-15, <strong>Experimental evidence of dark matter axions identical to solar axions and the absence of the “fifth” carrier force for the Higgs field</strong>, Vitaliy D. Rusov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07943v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07943v1</a></p>

<p>The complete “experimental” proof of the existence of axion luminosity and trapped ADMs in the interior of the Sun is the reason for the formation of hot dark matter axions (see modified Turner model (1987) with a critical density fraction of $\Omega_{axionHDM}^{thermal} \sim 0.32$ at a mass of $\sim6~eV$) between inflation and Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which are further transformed into mixed dark matter between Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmological microwave background (CMB) in the form of $\left[ \Omega_{axionHDM}^{thermal} \right]_{\sim 0.32} = \Omega_{ADM} + \Omega_{baryon}$ and $\left[ \Omega_{axionHDM}^{thermal} \right]_{axiogenesis} = \Omega_{axoinWDM}^{coherent} + \Omega_{baryon}$, where the first term 5 GeV ADM is the result of the decay of the partially composite dark matter of the Higgs boson, in which there is a remarkable absence of the “fifth” carrier force for the Higgs field in the Universe, and the second term $\Omega_{axoinWDM}^{coherent} \sim 4.5 \cdot 10^{-5}$ is associated with the mass of $\sim 3.2 \cdot 10^{-2} ~eV$ of coherent axions of warm dark matter, which are identical to solar axions with the same mass (Rusov et al. 2021).</p>

<p>2023-08-16, <strong>Fallback onto Kicked Neutron Stars and its Effect on Spin-Kick Alignment</strong>, B. Müller et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08312v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.08312v1</a></p>

<p>Fallback in core-collapse supernova explosions is potentially of significant importance for the birth spins of neutron stars and black holes. It has recently been pointed out that the angular momentum imparted onto a compact remnant by fallback material is subtly intertwined with its kick because fallback onto a moving neutron star or black hole will preferentially come for a conical region around its direction of travel. We show that contrary to earlier expectations such one-sided fallback accretion onto a neutron star will tend to produce spin-kick misalignment. Since the baroclinic driving term in the vorticity equation is perpendicular to the nearly radial pressure gradient, convective eddies in the progenitor as well as Rayleigh-Taylor plumes growing during the explosion primarily carry angular momentum perpendicular to the radial direction. Fallback material from the accretion volume of a moving neutron star therefore carries substantial angular momentum perpendicular to the kick velocity. We estimate the seed angular momentum fluctuations from convective motions in core-collapse supernova progenitors and argue that accreted fallback material will almost invariably be accreted with the maximum permissible specific angular momentum for reaching the Alfv'en radius. This imposes a limit of $\mathord{\sim}10^{-2}M_\odot$ of fallback accretion for fast-spinning young neutron stars with periods of $\mathord{\sim}20\,\mathrm{ms}$ and less for longer birth spin periods.</p>

<p>2023-08-16, <strong>White Dwarf Mass Growth in Cataclysmic Variables: Roles of Dwarf Novae</strong>, Wei-Min Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08298v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.08298v1</a></p>

<p>The disc instability mechanism (DIM) is widely accepted to account for the transient behaviour of dwarf novae (DNe), which experience short outbursts separated by long quiescence. The duty cycle (the ratio between the outburst duration and the recurrence time) determines the amount of accreted mass by the white dwarf (WDs) during outbursts, thus playing an important role in the long-term binary evolution. Employing the code of Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, we systemically investigate the influence of the duty cycles on the evolution of DNe and the mass growth of accreting carbon-oxygen (CO) WDs. Our calculations show that, while the DIM can considerably influence the accretion process, efficient WD-mass growth requires a particular range of the duty cycle. For WDs with the initial masses of 0.6, 0.7 and 1.1 $M_\odot$, these duty cycles are 0.006$\,\leq\(d\)\,\leq$0.007, $d$\,=\,0.005 and $d$\,=\,0.003, and the accumulated mass of the WDs can reach 0.1, 0.13 and 0.21 $M_\odot$, respectively. In all of our simulations, no CO WDs can grow their masses to the explosion mass of Type Ia supernovae of about $1.38~M_\odot$. Because of a much short timescale of the outburst state, the final donor-star masses and orbital periods are insensitive to the duty cycles. Therefore, we propose that the DIM in DNe could alleviate the WD mass problem to some extent.</p>

<p>2023-08-15, <strong>Giant molecular cloud G18.1-0.3+51 associated with HII regions and supernova remnant in the 3-kpc expanding ring</strong>, Yoshiaki Sofue et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07559v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07559v1</a></p>

<p>Analyzing the high-resolution CO-line survey of the Galactic plane with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope (FUGIN), we show that the star-forming complex G18.15-0.30+51 (G18) at radial velocity of 51 \kms is {a tight triple association of a giant molecular cloud (GMC), HII regions, and a supernova remnant (SNR).} The kinematical distance of G18 is determined to be $d=3.9\pm 0.2$ kpc for near solution for circular rotation, $12\pm 0.2$ kpc for far solution, or $d=6.1\pm 0.1$, if it is in the 3-kpc expanding ring. The HI-line absorption of radio continuum from the HII regions constrains the distance to $5.6 \lesssim d_{\rm SNR}\le 7.6$ kpc. The $\Sigma-D$ (radio brightness-diameter) relation yields the distance to the SNR of $d_{\rm SNR}=10.1^{+11.5}_{-4.7}$ kpc, allowing for a minimum distance of 5.4 kpc. From these we uniquely determined the distance of G18 to be $6.07\pm 0.13$ kpc in the 3-kpc expanding ring with the SNR being physically associated. The molecular mass of the GMC is estimated to be $M_{\rm mol}\sim 3\times 10^5 M_\odot$. The ratio of Virial to luminous molecular masses is greater than unity in the central region and decreases outward to $\lesssim 0.2$ at the cloud edge, indicating that the central region is dynamic, while the entire cloud is stable. We discuss the origin of the G18 triple system and propose a sustainable GMC model with continuous star formation.</p>
