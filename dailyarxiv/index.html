<p>2025-12-01, <strong>Probing Neutrino-Light-Quark Effective Scalar Interactions from Neutrino Masses</strong>, Feng-Zhi Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01947v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01947v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we use neutrino masses as a probe of the neutrino-light-quark effective scalar interactions. It is found that neutrinos can acquire masses not only from the usual light quark loop corrections but also from the light quark condensates. The latter contribution has been overlooked in the literature. We show that both contributions are comparable for operators involving $u$ and $d$ quarks, while quark loop corrections dominate for operators involving the $s$ quark. Using the low-energy effective field theory extended with light right-handed neutrinos and matching to chiral perturbation theory, we systematically analyze these contributions, deriving constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients from neutrino mass bounds, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, and light pseudoscalar meson invisible decays. Our analysis shows that electron neutrino mass measurements provide the most stringent constraints on these scalar couplings, significantly improving upon limits from other observables. The results highlight the importance of including both perturbative and nonperturbative contributions in complete phenomenological analyses of neutrino mass generation mechanisms.</p>

<p>2025-12-01, <strong>Classical Reconstruction of the PMNS Matrix Using a Mechanical Neutrino Oscillator</strong>, Nishil Savla et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01851v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01851v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino oscillations arise from quantum interference between neutrino mass eigenstates and are governed by the PMNS matrix. Although this is an intrinsically quantum phenomenon, its mathematical structure is analogous to systems of coupled classical oscillators. In this work, a three–pendulum system connected by springs is constructed as a classical analog of three–flavor neutrino oscillations. Measurements of amplitude transfer, normal–mode structure, and beat frequencies are used to extract a mechanical mixing matrix, which is compared with the structure of the PMNS matrix under the assumption of zero CP violation. A scaling relation linking mechanical time evolution to the neutrino (L/E) behavior is derived, clarifying the scope and limitations of the analogy. The experiment demonstrates how abstract concepts of neutrino mixing can be visualized using simple and accessible classical systems, offering both pedagogical value and a qualitative understanding of flavor oscillation dynamics.</p>

<p>2025-12-01, <strong>The effect of Coulomb interactions on relic neutrino detection via beta decaying impurities in (semi)metals</strong>, Karel van der Marck et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01752v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01752v1</a></p>

<p>Measuring the electron neutrino mass is a long-standing objective and requires a high energy resolution of certain $β$-decay experiments, as well as a visible cosmic neutrino background ($CνB$) spectrum. Many quantum mechanical and chemical effects could potentially impair the required resolution/visibility, e.g., the Coulomb interactions between the electrons in the \b{eta}-decaying impurity and in the solid-state environment. We analyze the effect when hybridization is suppressed completely using a dielectric spacer, and also when hybridization is present up to the lowest nontrivial order in perturbation theory.</p>

<p>2025-12-01, <strong>Electron-induced single-pion production to constrain the neutron structure in $^{40}$Ar. A proof of concept</strong>, J. García-Marcos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01721v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01721v1</a></p>

<p>We study electron-induced single-pion production as a way to constrain the neutron structure of $^{40}$Ar, information that is necessary for neutrino experiments using argon detectors. The proposed experimental signal consists in detecting in coincidence the scattered electron, a proton and a $π^-$. We performed simulations compatible with the experimental conditions of the MAMI (University of Mainz) and CLAS (Jefferson Lab) facilities. We have computed cross sections and evaluated the main backgrounds. MAMI is a three-spectrometer system with extremely good energy resolution and small acceptances. We found that, by choosing specific values of the final particle’s momenta, the shell structure can be well resolved, with negligible background contributions. CLAS is a large solid angle detector with poorer energy resolution. In both cases, the background can be kept under control by performing cuts in missing energy and missing momentum; however, in CLAS, the shell structure cannot be resolved due to the energy resolution. We conclude that MAMI is particularly appropriate for the proposed experiment, whereas CLAS is better suited for other studies.</p>

<p>2025-12-01, <strong>The impact of Solar magnetic field configurations on the production of gamma rays at the Solar disk</strong>, Julien Dörner et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01403v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01403v1</a></p>

<p>The Sun produces a steady signal of high-energy gamma rays through interactions of Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) with its atmosphere. Observations with Fermi-LAT and HAWC have revealed a gamma-ray flux significantly higher than early theoretical predictions, with unexpected temporal and spectral features that suggest a crucial role of the solar magnetic field. In this work, we model GCR-induced gamma-ray emission at the solar disk using the CRPropa framework with realistic hadronic interactions, chromospheric density profiles, and several magnetic field configurations over the solar cycle. This allows us to quantify the gamma-ray emission of the entire solar disk for different phases of the solar activity cycle and we present, for the first time, maps of the production locations of gamma rays on the solar surface. We consider both mono-energetic and realistic power-law injection spectra in a simplified dipole-quadrupole current sheet model and potential-field source surface (PFSS) extrapolations for Carrington rotations during solar maximum and minimum. Our results show that magnetic mirroring and large-scale field topology strongly affect the spectral shape and spatial distribution of the emission, with slightly enhanced fluxes predicted at solar minimum. While our simulated baseline fluxes remain below observations, additional effects, such as heavier nuclei, Parker-field mirroring, and deeper atmospheric interactions, could result in further enhancements of fluxes closer to observational values. Hadronic interactions do not only produce gamma rays but also neutrinos. We estimate the expected neutrino flux from the Sun based on our gamma-ray predictions. We find that the expected flux is slightly below current upper limits from IceCube.</p>

<p>2025-12-01, <strong>Panda: Self-distillation of Reusable Sensor-level Representations for High Energy Physics</strong>, Samuel Young et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01324v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01324v1</a></p>

<p>Liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs) provide dense, high-fidelity 3D measurements of particle interactions and underpin current and future neutrino and rare-event experiments. Physics reconstruction typically relies on complex detector-specific pipelines that use tens of hand-engineered pattern recognition algorithms or cascades of task-specific neural networks that require extensive, labeled simulation that requires a careful, time-consuming calibration process. We introduce \textbf{Panda}, a model that learns reusable sensor-level representations directly from raw unlabeled LArTPC data. Panda couples a hierarchical sparse 3D encoder with a multi-view, prototype-based self-distillation objective. On a simulated dataset, Panda substantially improves label efficiency and reconstruction quality, beating the previous state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model with 1,000$\times$ fewer labels. We also show that a single set-prediction head 1/20th the size of the backbone with no physical priors trained on frozen outputs from Panda can result in particle identification that is comparable with state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction tools. Full fine-tuning further improves performance across all tasks.</p>

<p>2025-11-30, <strong>Quasi-Dirac fermion: A source of neutrino mass and dark matter</strong>, Nguyen Thi Nguyet Nga et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00854v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.00854v1</a></p>

<p>Neutral vectorlike fermion as inspired by unified theories might become quasi-Dirac states at TeV due to a violation in lepton-like symmetry. It is shown that such quasi-Dirac fermions can properly achieve radiative neutrino mass generation and dark matter stability. Indeed, the small splitting of quasi-Dirac masses, i.e. $ΔM/M\ll 1$, suitably suppresses neutrino mass to be small in order to allow dark matter annihilation and detection to be appropriate to experiment as well as charged lepton flavor violation limit.</p>

<p>2025-12-01, <strong>Constraining Dark Acoustic Oscillations with the High-Redshift UV Luminosity Function</strong>, Jared Barron et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01998v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01998v1</a></p>

<p>Dark acoustic oscillations (DAOs) in the matter power spectrum can arise in many different dark sector models, and can imprint on a variety of cosmological observables. In this work we use measurements of the galactic UV luminosity function (UVLF) at high redshifts to constrain the dark acoustic oscillation feature at small scales in a model-agnostic way. We introduce a phenomenological transfer function model for a dark sector with a species undergoing DAOs which can accommodate sub-dominant dark matter abundances, and obtain constraints on its parameters. In order to predict the UVLF, we employ an Extended Press-Schechter formalism which we calibrate using N-body simulations with initial conditions featuring DAOs. Using measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, Subaru Telescope, and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we constrain the wave number of the first DAO peak to be at $k \gtrsim 50\ h/\mathrm{Mpc}$, unless the fraction of dark matter undergoing DAOs is less than $0.07$.</p>

<p>2025-12-01, <strong>Stability of Neutron-Dark Matter Mixed Stars and Hybrid Stars</strong>, Xiao-Ding Zhou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01641v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01641v1</a></p>

<p>Concerning the stability of two-fluid star models, we prove the rigorous equivalence of two independent determining methods for mixed stars, after a brief review of the hybrid star case. Our derivations apply to general multi-fluid cases, and here we take dark matter admixed neutron star models for example, demonstrating a stability boundary distinct from the single-fluid case. Stable configurations form a surface in the three-dimensional parameter space of (either) central pressure, mass, and radius, which yields a group containing stable mixed stars. This group includes twin stars with identical masses and radii but different interior structures. These results can help interpret compact star observations and constrain dark matter properties through astrophysics.</p>

<p>2025-12-01, <strong>Equivalence of Stability Criteria for Multi-Fluid Stars</strong>, Tian-Shun Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01640v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01640v1</a></p>

<p>We present a rigorous proof establishing the mathematical equivalence between two independent criteria for the marginal stability of multi-fluid relativistic stars: the dynamical criterion based on the vanishing of the fundamental radial pulsation mode’s eigenfrequency, and the static criterion derived from the geometric alignment of mass and particle number gradients in the parameter space. Leveraging this equivalence, we introduce a powerful and computationally efficient framework as an upgraded version of the critical curve method, to systematically map the stability boundaries for multi-fluid mixed stars across the entire parameter space of central pressures. Our analysis, applied to a variety of nuclear and dark matter equations of state, reveals the existence of stable region in the observable mass-radius diagram. By resolving degeneracies with 3-dimensional Mass-Radius-Pressure diagrams, we provide a complete topological view of the ensemble. This work supplies a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting multi-messenger astronomical observations and constraining the properties of dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-12-01, <strong>Analytical Emulator for the Baryon EoM inside the Fuzzy Dark Matter Soliton from Machine Learning</strong>, Ke Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01622v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01622v1</a></p>

<p>An empirical baryon density profile can be included in the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) equations to influence the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) soliton formation. However, to probe the effects of baryon on the other dynamical evolutions of the FDM soliton, its equation of motion (EoM) inside the corresponding FDM soliton is needed. In this paper, given an empirical baryon density profile, we first provide the cylinderical symmetric FDM soliton solution about the FDM density and the total potential of FDM and baryon. Then, we build an analytical baryon EoM from the obtained FDM density and total potential by machine learning. Finally, we check that this baryon EoM works as well as an empirical baryon density profile for the FDM soliton formation, with the fractional errors $\lesssim0.04$. It should also work well for some other simple FDM soliton evolutions.</p>

<p>2025-12-01, <strong>Exploring the ultra-faint dwarf Bootes I using JWST and HST: Metallicity distribution and binaries</strong>, F. Muratore et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01547v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01547v1</a></p>

<p>Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are among the oldest and most metal-poor stellar systems in the Universe. Their metallicity distribution encodes the fossil record of the earliest star formation, feedback, and chemical enrichment, providing crucial tests of models of the first stars, galaxy assembly, and dark matter halos. However, due to their faint luminosities and the limited number of bright giants, spectroscopic studies of UFDs typically probe only small stellar samples. Here, we present an analysis of multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope observations of the UFD Bootes I. Using deep color-magnitude diagram in the F606W and F322W2 bands, extending from the subgiant branch to the M-dwarfs, and stellar proper motions to identify likely members, we obtained an unprecedentedly clean census of the system. The exquisite quality of the diagram, combined with the sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to metallicity, allowed us to constrain the metallicity distribution in a large stellar sample. As a first step, we derived the binary fraction in Bootes I. This is crucial, since binaries can bias kinematic mass estimates, affect stellar population analyses, and shape the photometric signatures used to infer metallicity. We find that 20$\pm$2% of stellar systems in Bootes I are binaries with mass ratios larger than 0.4, corresponding to a total binary fraction of $\sim$30%. This value is comparable to the binary fractions observed in globular clusters of similar stellar mass, suggesting that the presence of dark matter does not significantly affect the binary properties of Bootes I. We then exploited the metallicity sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to derive the metallicity distribution function. We find that most of the stars $\sim$85% have [Fe/H]&lt;-2, and that roughly $\sim$17% have [Fe/H]&lt;-3.</p>

<p>2025-12-01, <strong>Accretion of Generalized Chaplygin Gas onto Cosmologically Coupled Black Holes</strong>, Luis F. Reis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01471v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01471v1</a></p>

<p>We study the accretion of cosmic dark fluids, responsible for driving the accelerated expansion of the universe, onto cosmologically coupled black holes. More specifically, we focus on the accretion of the Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG). To incorporate the global features of the GCG into this analysis, we employ the McVittie metric, which describes a black hole embedded in an expanding cosmological background. Within this framework, accretion is studied while consistently accounting for the backreaction on the metric components. Using a perturbative approach, we derive an expression for the effective black hole mass and for the evolution of both the black hole and cosmological apparent horizons under accretion. The analysis is performed in two distinct cosmological regimes: first, a matter-dominated era, and subsequently, a de Sitter era. In both cases, it is possible to determine analytically the instant in which accretion begins. For the matter-dominated era, the analytical expression shows that the greater the amount of matter available for accretion, the longer the accretion takes to start.</p>

<p>2025-12-01, <strong>Resonant Annihilation of WIMP Dark Matter for Halo Gamma Ray Signal</strong>, Hitoshi Murayama et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01404v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01404v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a resonant annihilation as a way to reconcile the WIMP annihilation cross sections in a recently reported gamma ray signal from the Milky Way halo with that for the freeze-out and the upper limit from dwarf galaxies. We perform a simple model-independent analysis based on this hypothesis and determine the required parameters. We also present a simple particle-physics model that can accommodate them.</p>

<p>2025-12-01, <strong>Joint Constraints on Fuzzy and Warm Dark Matter from Satellite Populations of the Milky Way and Andromeda</strong>, Jianxiang Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01361v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01361v1</a></p>

<p>We perform a joint analysis of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) satellite populations to constrain the properties of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) and thermal-relic warm dark matter (WDM). We combine MW satellite observations from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) with M31 satellite data from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS), and model the corresponding observable satellite populations using the galaxy–halo connection model together with the appropriate selection functions. Uncertainties in the virial masses of the MW and M31 are incorporated through host-mass priors that linearly scale the relevant model parameters, allowing us to infer the full posterior distributions of all parameters. For the FDM case, we obtain $m_{\mathrm{FDM}} &gt; 1.75 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ (95% CL) and $m_{\mathrm{FDM}} &gt; 1.41 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ (20:1 posterior ratio). For thermal-relic WDM, we find $m_{\mathrm{WDM}} &gt; 6.22~\mathrm{keV}$ (95% CL) and $m_{\mathrm{WDM}} &gt; 5.75~\mathrm{keV}$ (20:1 posterior ratio). These results represent a moderate improvement over MW-only constraints, and provide the strongest constraints to date on the FDM and WDM derived from satellite galaxy populations in the Local Group.</p>

<p>2025-11-30, <strong>Imprints of Dark Matter on the Shadow and Polarization Images of a Black Hole Illuminated by Various Thick Disks</strong>, Muhammad Israr Aslam et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00964v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.00964v1</a></p>

<p>Based on two distinct thick accretion flow disk models, such as a phenomenological RIAF-like model and an analytical Hou disk model, we investigate the impact of relevant parameters on the visual characteristics of the Schwarzschild black hole (BH) surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM). We impose a general relativistic radiative transfer equation to determine the synchrotron emission from thermal electrons and generate horizon-scale images. In the RIAF-like model, we notice that the corresponding photon ring and central dark region are expanded with the aid of the PFDM parameter $η$, with brightness asymmetries originating at higher inclination angles and closely tied to flow dynamics and emission anisotropy. The fundamental difference between isotropic and anisotropic radiation is that anisotropy introduces vertical distortions in the higher-order images, resulting in an elliptical appearance. For the Hou disk model, the observed images produce narrower rings and dark interiors, while polarization patterns trace the brightness distribution and changes with the variations of the inclination angle and PFDM parameter $η$, which reflects the spacetime signature. All these results indicate that the observed intensity and polarization characteristics in the framework of thick disk models may serve as valuable probes of underlying spacetime geometry and the accretion-dynamics close to the horizon.</p>

<p>We investigated the shadow and optical appearance of Bardeen black hole (BH) immersed in perfect-fluid dark matter (PFDM). Using the EHT data, we find that the DM parameter is restricted to a narrow allowed range, confined to values of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1}-10^{-2})$. Additionally, we observed that increasing the DM parameter substantially enlarges the photon sphere, the critical impact parameter, and thus the shadow radius, whereas the magnetic charge $g$ produces only negligible corrections. The DM component also modifies the optical appearance of the accretion disk: higher $b$ systematically suppresses the observed radiation intensity and reduces image brightness, while changes in $g$ yield only marginal effects. Subsequently, using the Novikov-Thorne thin disk model, we analyze primary and secondary images, observed flux, and redshift patterns, showing that PFDM noticeably alters image size and brightness whereas magnetic charge has a negligible influence. No blueshifted regions appear in any configuration. These results highlight several promising observational signatures for testing DM environments and nonlinear electrodynamic effects around BHs.</p>

<p>2025-11-30, <strong>Investigating the Correlation between Dark Matter Content, Ages and Mass-to-Light Ratios in Spiral Galaxies</strong>, Arpit Kottur et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00823v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.00823v1</a></p>

<p>We present an empirical investigation into the relationship between galactic age and dark matter content across a sample of 16 nearby, well-resolved spiral galaxies. Using raw rotation curve data from IOA Tokyo’s publicly available repository, we model each galaxy’s mass distribution via a three-component decomposition (Hernquist bulge, exponential disk, and a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark matter halo) fit using Monte Carlo simulations. The onset of dark matter dominance was identified using the NFW scale radius, beyond which we computed the total enclosed mass via Keplerian dynamics. I-band luminosities for these regions were estimated using a calibrated Tully-Fisher relation, yielding precise mass-to-light (M/L) ratios. We further calculated dark matter mass and density using NFW profile equations, and galaxy ages were retrieved through an extensive literature survey of stellar population studies.   Our analysis reveals strong positive correlations between galactic age and both dark matter mass (Pearson $r \approx 0.91$; Spearman $ρ\approx 0.93$) and density (Pearson $r \approx 0.91$; Spearman $ρ\approx 0.91$), as well as M/L ratios, suggesting a robust link between evolutionary history and dark matter build-up. These findings are in quantitative agreement with predictions from large-scale cosmological simulations that incorporate assembly bias and smooth accretion-dominated growth, reinforcing the view that older galaxies, having formed earlier in high-density peaks, have accumulated significantly more dark matter over cosmic time. Our results offer observational evidence for time-dependent dark matter assembly and establish galactic age as a meaningful tracer of halo evolution.</p>

<p>2025-12-01, <strong>Accurate cosmological emulator for the probability distribution function of gravitational lensing of point sources</strong>, Tunç Türker et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01607v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01607v1</a></p>

<p>We develop an accurate and computationally efficient emulator to model the gravitational lensing magnification probability distribution function (PDF), enabling robust cosmological inference of point sources such as supernovae and gravitational-wave observations. We construct a pipeline utilizing cosmological $N$-body simulations, creating past light cones to compute convergence and shear maps. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed for dimensionality reduction, followed by an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning model to interpolate magnification PDFs across a broad cosmological parameter space ($Ω_m$, $σ_8$, $w$, $h$) and redshift range ($0.2 \le z \le 6$). We identify the optimal number of PCA components to balance accuracy and stability. Our emulator, publicly released as ace_lensing, accurately reproduces lensing PDFs with a median Kullback-Leibler divergence of $0.007$. Validation on the test set confirmed that the model reliably reproduces the detailed shapes and statistical properties of the PDFs across the explored parameter range, showing no significant degradation for specific parameter combinations or redshifts. Future work will focus on incorporating baryonic physics through hydrodynamical simulations and expanding the training set to further enhance model accuracy and generalizability.</p>

<p>2025-12-01, <strong>Type IIP SN 2024bch: Hydrodynamic model, shock breakout, and circumstellar interaction</strong>, V. P. Utrobin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01552v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01552v1</a></p>

<p>The well-observed type IIP SN 2024bch with the short plateau is shown to be an outcome of the red supergiant explosion with the presupernova mass of 14-15 Msun, the explosion energy of 2x10^{51} erg, and presupernova radius of 1250 Rsun. The early gamma-ray escape demonstrated by the radioactive tail is due to the large Ni-56 extension up to 7400 km/s. The early-time spectral evolution indicates the presence of the circumstellar dense confined envelope with the mass of 0.003-0.006 Msun within 6x10^{14} cm. The deceleration of the outermost ejecta implies the wind with the mass-loss rate of about 6x10^{-4} Msun/yr. The inferred mass-loss rate is by one-two order larger compared to most of type IIP supernovae, but comparable to the wind of type IIL SN 1998S. The asymmetry of the broad H-alpha component on day 144 powered by the circumstellar interaction is the outcome of the Thomson scattering and absorption in the Paschen continuum in the unshocked ejecta.</p>

<p>2025-12-01, <strong>Multi-frequency radio-continuum study of the LMC SNR N206 (Goat’s Eye) and its “zig-zag” PWN</strong>, M. Ghavam et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01221v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01221v1</a></p>

<p>We present new radio-continuum observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) supernova remnant (SNR) N206, which we give the name “Goat’s Eye”. Goat’s Eye contains an interior radio structure that is likely a pulsar wind nebula (PWN), which we analyse in further detail. We use new radio observations from the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) telescope, as well as several archival radio observations, to calculate spectral indices, and find a steep spectral index for the whole SNR ($α= -0.60\pm0.02$), and a flatter spectral index for the PWN ($α= -0.16\pm0.03$). We also measure the polarisation and magnetic field properties of the PWN. Previously reported as a linear structure, the new observations show an unusual “zig-zag”-like structure, visible in radio-continuum total intensity, linear polarisation, and magnetic field orientations. The origin of this zig-zag structure is unclear, but we propose some origin scenarios that will require further observations to differentiate between.</p>

<p>2025-12-01, <strong>Revisiting the Supernova Engines in the 3C 397 and W49B Supernova Remnants</strong>, Cole Treyturik et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01176v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.01176v1</a></p>

<p>The nature of the supernova remnants (SNRs) 3C 397 and W49B has long been a subject of debate, with prior studies offering conflicting interpretations between thermonuclear and core-collapse scenarios. To help settle this debate, we present a systematic, spatially resolved, spectroscopic analysis of both remnants using XMM-Newton. By applying multi-component thermal models, we derive key physical properties including elemental abundances, ejecta temperatures, ambient densities, and explosion energetics. We compare the inferred metal abundance ratios to a wide range of core-collapse and thermonuclear nucleosynthesis models, including new models whose explosion energies differ from the canonical value of $10^{51}$ ergs. We find that the observed Fe/Si and Ca/Si ratios in both SNRs are best matched by certain thermonuclear models. However, no model fully reproduces the complete set of observed abundance patterns. In 3C 397, high Fe enrichment and spatial abundance variations suggest interaction with a dense progenitor environment, and W49B’s composition is overall consistent with a thermonuclear origin; however both require a low energy ($\sim 10^{50}$ erg) supernova explosion. We additionally map the Fe K$α$ line centroid energies and find a spread, with W49B falling within the core-collapse region – highlighting both environmental complexity and the limitations of this diagnostic for supernova classification. Our results highlight the need for caution in relying on any single diagnostic or nucleosynthesis model for supernova typing, underscore the need for improved nucleosynthesis models, and motivate future high-resolution, high-throughput observations.</p>

<p>2025-11-30, <strong>SMSS J022423.27$-$573705.1: An Extremely Metal-Poor Star with the Most Pronounced Weak $r$-Process Signature</strong>, Hiroko Okada et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00721v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2512.00721v1</a></p>

<p>We present the measurement of 26 elemental abundances of SMSS J022423.27$-$573705.1 (SMSS 0224$-$5737), an extremely metal-poor (EMP) star with a weak $r$-process signature. We report the measurements of N, O, V, Zn, and Ba, and the upper limits for Mo, Ru, Pd, Ag, and Eu for the first time. SMSS 0224$-$5737 exhibits low C abundance and high N and O abundances suggesting that C is converted to N by the enhanced mixing during the evolution. The abundance pattern up to the Fe-peak elements is generally in good agreement with the average abundance of EMP stars, although a notable feature is the high [Zn/Fe] ratio ([Zn/Fe] $= +0.88$). We confirm the enhancement of the first-peak neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, and Zr) and determine a low Ba abundance [Ba/H] $= -5.25$, that is, [Ba/Fe] $= -1.45$. The extremely high ratio of [Zr/Ba] $= +2.60$ makes SMSS 0224$-$5737 the EMP star with the most pronounced weak $r$-process signature observed to date. The abundance pattern of the neutron-capture elements is compared with the yields from $r$-process nucleosynthesis models. The sharp decline in abundances beyond Zr disfavors neutron star merger or electron-capture supernova models, but are reproduced either by proto-neutron star wind models or by magneto-rotational supernova models. Considering the high [Zn/Fe] ratio, a magneto-rotational supernova is the most plausible origin of SMSS 0224$-$5737. This study demonstrates that the abundance measurements of both light and neutron-capture elements, even at low abundances, are crucial for unveiling the astrophysical sites of the weak $r$-process.</p>
