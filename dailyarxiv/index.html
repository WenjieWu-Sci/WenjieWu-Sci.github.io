<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Complete Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model File</strong>, Jonathan Kriewald et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07756v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07756v1</a></p>

<p>We develop a comprehensive implementation of the minimal Left-Right symmetric model within a FeynRules model file. We derive the complete set of mass spectra and mixings for the charged and neutral gauge bosons, would-be-Goldstones and gauge fixing, together with the ghost Lagrangian. In the scalar sector, we analytically re-derive all the massive states with mixings and devise a physical input scheme, which expresses the model couplings in terms of masses and mixing angles of all states. Fermion couplings are determined in closed form, including the Dirac mixing in the neutrino sector, evaluated explicitly with the Cayley-Hamilton method. We calculate the one loop next-to-leading QCD corrections and provide a complete UFO file for NLO studies, demonstrated on relevant benchmarks. We provide various restricted variants of the model file with different gauges, massless states, neutrino hierarchies and parity violating $g_L \neq g_R$ gauge couplings.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Identifying a point-symmetric morphology in supernova remnant Cassiopeia A: explosion by jittering jets</strong>, Ealeal Bear et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07625v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07625v1</a></p>

<p>We identify a point-symmetric morphology of the supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A compatible with shaping by at least two, and more likely more than four, pairs of opposite jets, as expected in the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of core-collapse supernovae. Using an old X-ray map of argon, we identify seven pairs of opposite morphological features that we connect with lines that cross each other at the same point on the plane of the sky. The opposite morphological features include protrusions, clumps, filaments, and funnels in the main SNR shell. In addition to these seven symmetry axes, we find two tentative symmetry axes (lines). These lines form a point-symmetric wind-rose. We place this point-symmetric wind-rose on a new JWST and X-ray images of Cassiopeia A. We find other morphological features and one more symmetry axis that strengthen the identified point-symmetric morphology. Not all symmetry axes correspond to jets; e.g., some clumps are formed by the compression of ejecta between two jet-inflated lobes (bubbles). The robust point-symmetric morphology in the iconic Cassiopeia A SNR strongly supports the JJEM and poses a severe challenge to the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Validation of electrodeposited 241Am alpha-particle sources for use in liquified gas detectors at cryogenic temperatures</strong>, E. Calvo Alamillo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07539v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07539v1</a></p>

<p>This paper describes a procedure for the validation of alpha-particle sources (exempt unsealed sources) to be used in experimental setups with liquefied gases at cryogenic temperatures (down to -196 C) and high vacuum. These setups are of interest for the development and characterization of neutrino and dark matter detectors based on liquid argon, among others. Due to the high purity requirements, the sources have to withstand high vacuum and cryogenic temperatures for extended periods. The validation procedure has been applied to 241Am sources produced by electrodeposition.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Search for CP-violating Neutrino Non-Standard Interactions with the NOvA Experiment</strong>, NOvA Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07266v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07266v1</a></p>

<p>This Letter reports a search for charge-parity (CP) symmetry violating non-standard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with matter using the NOvA Experiment, and examines their effects on the determination of the standard oscillation parameters. Data from $\nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})\rightarrow\nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})$ and $\nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})\rightarrow\nu_{e}(\bar{\nu}_{e})$ oscillation channels are used to measure the effect of the NSI parameters $\varepsilon_{e\mu}$ and $\varepsilon_{e\tau}$. With 90% C.L. the magnitudes of the NSI couplings are constrained to be $|\varepsilon_{e\mu}| \, \lesssim 0.3$ and $|\varepsilon_{e\tau}| \, \lesssim 0.4$. A degeneracy at $|\varepsilon_{e\tau}| \, \approx 1.8$ is reported, and we observe that the presence of NSI limits sensitivity to the standard CP phase $\delta_{\tiny\text{CP}}$.</p>

<p>2024-03-11, <strong>Performance of SK-Gdâs Upgraded Real-time Supernova Monitoring System</strong>, The Super-Kamiokande collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06760v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.06760v1</a></p>

<p>Among multi-messenger observations of the next galactic core-collapse supernova, Super-Kamiokande (SK) plays a critical role in detecting the emitted supernova neutrinos, determining the direction to the supernova (SN), and notifying the astronomical community of these observations in advance of the optical signal. On 2022, SK has increased the gadolinium dissolved in its water target (SK-Gd) and has achieved a Gd concentration of 0.033%, resulting in enhanced neutron detection capability, which in turn enables more accurate determination of the supernova direction. Accordingly, SK-Gdâs real-time supernova monitoring system (Abe te al. 2016b) has been upgraded. SK_SN Notice, a warning system that works together with this monitoring system, was released on December 13, 2021, and is available through GCN Notices (Barthelmy et al. 2000). When the monitoring system detects an SN-like burst of events, SK_SN Notice will automatically distribute an alarm with the reconstructed direction to the supernova candidate within a few minutes. In this paper, we present a systematic study of SK-Gdâs response to a simulated galactic SN. Assuming a supernova situated at 10 kpc, neutrino fluxes from six supernova models are used to characterize SK-Gdâs pointing accuracy using the same tools as the online monitoring system. The pointing accuracy is found to vary from 3-7$^\circ$ depending on the models. However, if the supernova is closer than 10 kpc, SK_SN Notice can issue an alarm with three-degree accuracy, which will benefit follow-up observations by optical telescopes with large fields of view.</p>

<p>2024-03-11, <strong>Observing neutrinos from failed Supernovae at LNGS</strong>, Giulia Pagliaroli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06678v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.06678v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the possibility to observe neutrinos emitted from a failed core collapse Supernova in the various experiments at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. We show that the veto regions of dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments can be used as a network of small detectors to measure Supernova neutrinos. In addition we show that this network can measure very precisely the moment of black hole formation, which can be then used in the nearby VIRGO detector and future Einstein Telescope to look for the gravitational wave counterpart to the neutrino signal.</p>

<p>2024-03-11, <strong>Study of dark matter scattering off ${}^2$H and ${}^4$He nuclei within chiral effective field theory</strong>, E. Filandri et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06599v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.06599v1</a></p>

<p>We study dark matter, assumed to be composed by weak interacting massive particles (WIMPs), scattering off ${}^2$H and ${}^4$He nuclei. In order to parameterize the WIMP-nucleon interaction the chiral effective field theory approach is used. Considering only interactions invariant under parity, charge conjugation and time reversal, we examine five interaction types: scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial and tensor. Scattering amplitudes between two nucleons and a WIMP are determined up to second order of chiral perturbation theory. We apply this program to calculate the interaction rate as function of the WIMP mass and of the magnitude of the WIMP-quark coupling constants. From our study, we conclude that the scalar nuclear response functions result much greater than the others due to theirs large combination of low energy constants. We verify that the leading order contributions are dominant in this low energy processes. We also provide an estimate for the background due to atmospheric neutrinos.</p>

<p>2024-03-11, <strong>Distinguishing Dirac/Majorana Heavy Neutrino at Future Lepton Colliders</strong>, Qing-Hong Cao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06561v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.06561v1</a></p>

<p>We propose to identify whether a sterile neutrino is Dirac-type or Majorana-type by counting the peak of the rapidity distribution at lepton colliders. Our method requires only one charged-lepton tagging, and the nature of sterile neutrinos can be pinned down once they are confirmed.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Search for new bosons with ytterbium isotope shifts</strong>, Menno Door et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07792v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07792v1</a></p>

<p>The Standard Model of particle physics describes the properties of elementary particles and their interactions remarkably well, but in particular does not account for dark matter. Isotope-shift spectroscopy is a sensitive probe of fifth forces and new particles that illuminate the dark matter sector. This method sets bounds on new bosons that couple neutrons and electrons with masses in the keV/c2 to MeV/c2 range. With increasing spectroscopic precision, such searches are limited by uncertainties of isotope masses and the understanding of nuclear structure. Here, we report on high-precision mass-ratio and isotope-shift measurements of the ytterbium isotopes $^{168,170,172,174,176}$Yb that exceed previous measurements by up to two orders of magnitude. From these measurements, we extract higher-order changes in the nuclear charge distribution along the Yb isotope chain and use these to benchmark novel ab initio calculations. Our measurements set new bounds on the existence of the proposed boson.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Models of Accidental Dark Matter with a Fundamental Scalar</strong>, Stefano Palmisano et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07759v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07759v1</a></p>

<p>We consider models of accidental dark matter, namely models in which the dark matter is a composite state that is stable thanks to an accidental symmetry of the theory. The fundamental constituents are vectorlike fermions, taken to be fragments of representations of the grand unifying gauge group $SU(5)$, as well as a scalar singlet. All the new fields are charged under a new confining gauge group, which we take to be $SU(N)$, leading to models with complex dark matter. We analyse the models in the context of $SU(5)$ grand unification with a non-standard approach recently proposed in the literature. The advantage of including the scalar mainly resides in the fact that it allows to break several undesired accidental symmetries leading to a larger set of viable models with respect to previous literature, in which only fermions (or only scalars) were considered. Moreover these models present distinct novelties, namely dark states with non-zero baryon and lepton number and the existence of composite hybrid states of fermions and scalars. We identify phenomena that are specific to the inclusion of the scalar and discuss possibilities to test this setup.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Enhanced Monochromatic Photon Emission from Millicharged Co-Interacting Dark Matter</strong>, Mingxuan Du et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07528v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07528v1</a></p>

<p>We study a millicharged co-interacting dark matter scenario, where the primary dark matter constituent is the dark photon $Aâ$ and the secondary component is the fermion $\chi$. In this model, $\chi$ interacts with $Aâ$ via a $U(1)â$ interaction while being millicharged with respect to normal photons. Our investigation focuses on the oscillation of $Aâ$ dark matter into photons within the background of $\chi$ particles, revealing that the $Aâ-\chi$ scattering rate benefits from a Bose enhancement of the $Aâ$ final state. As the oscillation production rate is directly linked to the scattering rate, the conversion of $Aâ$ dark matter into monochromatic photons experiences significant amplification owing to this Bose enhancement, especially when the scattering rate $\Gamma_{\rm sca}$ approaches the dark photon mass $m_{Aâ}$. These converted monochromatic photons are detectable through radio telescopes and can induce distortions in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectrum. We find that the sensitivity of radio telescopes and the constraints imposed by CMB distortion on the kinetic mixing parameter are notably heightened compared to scenarios without the subdominant millicharged dark matter.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Reheated Sub-40000 Kelvin Neutron Stars at the JWST, ELT, and TMT</strong>, Nirmal Raj et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07496v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07496v1</a></p>

<p>Neutron stars cooling passively since their birth may be reheated in their late-stage evolution by a number of possible phenomena: rotochemical, vortex creep, crust cracking, magnetic field decay, or more exotic processes such as removal of neutrons from their Fermi seas (the nucleon Auger effect), baryon number-violating nucleon decay, and accretion of particle dark matter. Using Exposure Time Calculator tools, we show that reheating mechanisms imparting effective temperatures of 2000â40000 Kelvin may be uncovered with excellent sensitivities at the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), and the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), with imaging instruments operating from visible-edge to near-infrared. With a day of exposure, they could constrain the reheating luminosity of a neutron star up to a distance of 500 pc, within which about $10^5$ (undiscovered) neutron stars lie. Detection in multiple filters could overconstrain a neutron starâs surface temperature, distance from Earth, mass, and radius. Using publicly available catalogues of newly discovered pulsars at the FAST and CHIME radio telescopes and the Galactic electron distribution models YMW16 and NE2001, we estimate the pulsarsâ dispersion measure distance from Earth, and find that potentially 30$-$40 of these may be inspected for late-stage reheating within viable exposure times, in addition to a few hundred candidates already present in the ATNF catalogue. Whereas the coldest neutron star observed (PSR J2144$-$3933) has an upper limit on its effective temperature of about 33000 Kelvin with the Hubble Space Telescope, we show that the effective temperature may be constrained down to 20000 Kelvin with JWST-NIRCam, 15000 Kelvin at ELT-MICADO, and 9000 Kelvin with TMT-IRIS. Campaigns to measure thermal luminosities of old neutron stars would be transformative for astrophysics and fundamental physics.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Predicting the Scaling Relations between the Dark Matter Halo Mass and Observables from Generalised Profiles I: Kinematic Tracers</strong>, Andrew Sullivan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07352v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07352v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the relationship between a dark matter haloâs mass profile and measures of the velocity dispersion of kinematic tracers within its gravitational potential. By predicting the scaling relation of the halo mass with the aperture velocity dispersion, $M_\mathrm{vir} - \sigma_\mathrm{ap}$, we present the expected form and dependence of this halo mass tracer on physical parameters within our analytic halo model: parameterised by the haloâs negative inner logarithmic density slope, $\alpha$, its concentration parameter, $c$, and its velocity anisotropy parameter, $\beta$. For these idealised halos, we obtain a general solution to the Jeans equation, which is projected over the line of sight and averaged within an aperture to form the corresponding aperture velocity dispersion profile. Through dimensional analysis, the $M_\mathrm{vir} - \sigma_\mathrm{ap}$ scaling relation is devised explicitly in terms of analytical bounds for these aperture velocity dispersion profiles: allowing constraints to be placed on this relation for motivated parameter choices. We predict the $M_{200} - \sigma_\mathrm{ap}$ and $M_{500} - \sigma_\mathrm{ap}$ scaling relations, each with an uncertainty of $60.5\%$ and $56.2\%$, respectively. These halo mass estimates are found to be weakly sensitive to the haloâs concentration and mass scale, and most sensitive to the size of the aperture radius in which the aperture velocity dispersion is measured, the maximum value for the haloâs inner slope, and the minimum and maximum values of the velocity anisotropy. Our results show that a haloâs structural and kinematic profiles impose only a minor uncertainty in estimating its mass. Consequently, spectroscopic surveys aimed at constraining the halo mass using kinematic tracers can focus on characterising other, more complex sources of uncertainty and observational systematics.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>$Î±$-Generalized No-Scale Inflation</strong>, Lina Wu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07333v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07333v1</a></p>

<p>We propose the $\alpha$-generalized no-scale supergravity, and study the corresponding inflationary models. With a new parameter $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$, the $\alpha$-generalized no-scale supergravity provides the continuous connections among the generic no-scale supergravity from string theory compactifications. The resulting prediction of the CMB, spectrum index $n_s$, and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ can be highly consistent with the latest Planck/BICEP/Keck Array observations. Notably, the models with $\alpha\neq 1$ give a smaller ratio $r\leq 10^{-3}$, which is flexible even under the anticipated tighter observational constraints at the future experiments. Additionally, these models have the potential to generate a broad-band stochastic gravitational wave background, and thus explain the NANOGrav 15yr signal. Furthermore, they predict the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) with various mass scales, which could account for an significant portion of dark matter relic density in the Universe.</p>

<p>2024-03-11, <strong>Enhancement of $p$-wave dark matter annihilation by quasi-bound states</strong>, Martin Beneke et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07108v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07108v1</a></p>

<p>We scrutinize the Sommerfeld enhancement in dark matter pair annihilation for $p$-wave and higher-$\ell$ partial waves. For the Yukawa potential these feature a super-resonant Breit-Wigner peak in their velocity-dependence close to Sommerfeld resonances as well as a universal scaling with velocity for all $\ell\geq 1$ that differs from the $s$-wave case. We provide a quantum mechanical explanation for these phenomena in terms of quasi-bound states sustained by the centrifugal barrier of the partial-wave potential, and give approximate WKB expressions capturing the main effects. The impact of quasi-bound states is exemplified for wino dark matter and models with light mediators, with a focus on indirect detection signals. We note that quasi-bound states can also explain similar peaks in the bound-state formation and self-scattering cross sections.</p>

<p>2024-03-11, <strong>Dark Matter-induced electron excitations in silicon and germanium with Deep Learning</strong>, Riccardo Catena et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07053v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07053v1</a></p>

<p>We train a deep neural network (DNN) to output rates of dark matter (DM) induced electron excitations in silicon and germanium detectors. Our DNN provides a massive speedup of around $5$ orders of magnitude relative to existing methods (i.e. QEdark-EFT), allowing for extensive parameter scans in the event of an observed DM signal. The network is also lighter and simpler to use than alternative computational frameworks based on a direct calculation of the DM-induced excitation rate. The DNN can be downloaded $\href{https://github.com/urdshals/DEDD}{\text{here}}$.</p>

<p>In this study, we explore the influence of quark-antiquark confinement on the deflection angle within the framework of nonlinear electrodynamic (NED) black holes. To achieve this, we establish the appropriate optical spacetime metric and subsequently determine the Gaussian optical curvature. Utilizing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we investigate the impact of quark-antiquark confinement on the deflection angle exhibited by NED black holes. Additionally, we delve into the effects of a cold non-magnetized plasma medium and also axion-plasmon on gravitational lensing. Our findings highlight the significance of the axion-plasmon effect on the optical properties of NED black holes, particularly its influence on gravitational lensing. This exploration is particularly relevant in the context of the axionâs potential role as a dark matter candidate. The multifaceted interplay between quark-antiquark confinement, nonlinear electrodynamics, and plasma dynamics provides a nuanced understanding of gravitational lensing phenomena. These insights contribute to ongoing research in dark matter studies and offer avenues for further theoretical and observational investigations in astrophysics.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>SIDE-real: Truncated marginal neural ratio estimation for Supernova Ia Dust Extinction with real data</strong>, Konstantin Karchev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07871v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07871v1</a></p>

<p>We present the first fully simulation-based hierarchical analysis of the light curves of a population of low-redshift type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia). Our hardware-accelerated forward model, released in the Python package slicsim, includes stochastic variations of each SNâs spectral flux distribution (based on the pre-trained BayeSN model), extinction from dust in the host and in the Milky Way, redshift, and realistic instrumental noise. By utilising truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE), a neural network-enabled simulation-based inference technique, we implicitly marginalise over 4000 latent variables (for a set of $\approx 100$ SNae Ia) to efficiently infer SN Ia absolute magnitudes and host-galaxy dust properties at the population level while also constraining the parameters of individual objects. Amortisation of the inference procedure allows us to obtain coverage guarantees for our results through Bayesian validation and frequentist calibration. Furthermore, we show a detailed comparison to full likelihood-based inference, implemented through Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, on simulated data and then apply TMNRE to the light curves of 86 SNae Ia from the Carnegie Supernova Project, deriving marginal posteriors in excellent agreement with previous work. Given its ability to accommodate arbitrarily complex extensions to the forward model â e.g. different populations based on host properties, redshift evolution, complicated photometric redshift estimates, selection effects, and non-Ia contamination â without significant modifications to the inference procedure, TMNRE has the potential to become the tool of choice for cosmological parameter inference from future, large SN Ia samples.</p>

<p>2024-03-11, <strong>To Be or not to Be: the role of rotation in modeling Galactic Be X-ray Binaries</strong>, Kyle Akira Rocha et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07172v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07172v1</a></p>

<p>Be X-ray binaries (Be-XRBs) are crucial in understanding high-mass X-ray binaries, featuring a rapidly rotating Be star and a neutron star companion in an eccentric orbit, intermittently accreting material from the Be starâs decretion disk. Originating from binary stellar evolution, Be-XRBs are of significant interest to binary population synthesis (BPS) studies, encapsulating the physics of supernovae, common envelope, and mass transfer (MT). Using the POSYDON BPS code, employing pre-computed grids of detailed binary stellar evolution models, we investigate the Galactic Be-XRB population. POSYDON incorporates stellar rotation self-consistently during MT phases, enabling a detailed examination of the rotational distribution of Be stars. Our fiducial BPS and Be-XRB model align well with the orbital properties of Galactic Be-XRBs, emphasizing the role of rotational constraints. Our modeling reveals a bimodal rotational distribution of Be-XRB-like systems, in excellent agreement with literature values. All Be-XRBs undergo an MT phase before the first compact object forms, with over half experiencing a second MT phase from a stripped helium companion (Case BB). Computing rotationally-limited MT efficiencies and applying them to our population, we find that the majority of Be-XRBs have undergone highly non-conservative MT (beta ~ 0.15). Our study underscores the importance of detailed angular momentum modeling during MT in interpreting Be-XRB populations, emphasizing this population as a key probe for the stability and efficiency of MT in interacting binaries.</p>

<p>2024-03-11, <strong>The Peak Frequency and Luminosity of Synchrotron Emitting Shocks: from Non-Relativistic to Ultra-Relativistic Explosions</strong>, Ben Margalit et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07048v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07048v1</a></p>

<p>Synchrotron emission is ubiquitous in explosive astrophysical events â it is a natural byproduct of shocks formed when matter expelled by the explosion collides with ambient material. This emission is well-observed in various classes of transients, and is often interpreted within a canonical `equipartitionâ framework that allows physical properties of the shock to be inferred from the frequency and luminosity at which the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks. This framework has been remarkably successful in explaining observations of radio supernovae. It has also been used for trans-relativistic explosions, where the shock velocities approach the speed of light. However, the conventional framework does not incorporate relativistic effects. Neither does it account for thermal electrons, which have been shown to be important for high-velocity shocks. In this paper we describe a revised framework that accounts for these two effects, and is applicable to non-relativistic, trans-relativistic, and ultra-relativistic explosions. We show that accounting for these effects can dramatically change the inferred parameters of high-velocity shocks, and in particular â that the shock velocity, ambient density, and total energy are overestimated by the conventional non-relativistic framework. We delineate the phase-space where such modifications are important in terms of observationally measurable parameters. We also find a novel upper limit on the peak synchrotron luminosity of shock-powered transients, which is remarkably consistent with existing observations. Finally, we discuss a prediction of the model â that the SED will qualitatively change as a function of shock velocity â and show that this is broadly consistent with data for representative events (e.g., SN1998bw, AT2018cow, CSS161010, AT2020xnd).</p>
