<p>2023-08-14, <strong>Heavy neutrino-antineutrino oscillations at the FCC-ee</strong>, Stefan Antusch et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07297v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07297v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the impact of heavy neutrino-antineutrino oscillations (NNOs) on heavy neutral lepton (HNL) searches at proposed electron-positron colliders such as the future circular $e^+e^-$ collider (FCC-ee). During the $Z$ pole run, HNLs can be produced alongside a light neutrino or antineutrino that escapes detection and can decay into a charged lepton or antilepton together with an off-shell $W$ boson. In this case, signals of lepton number violation only show up in the final state distributions. We discuss how NNOs, a typical feature of collider-testable low-scale seesaw models where the heavy neutrinos form pseudo-Dirac pairs, modify such final state distributions. For example, the forward-backward asymmetry (FBA) of the reconstructed heavy (anti)neutrinos develops an oscillatory dependence on the HNL lifetime. We show that these oscillations can be resolvable for long-lived HNLs. We also discuss that when the NNOs are not resolvable, they can nevertheless significantly modify the theory predictions for FBAs and observables such as the ratio of the total number of HNL decays into $\ell^-$ over ones into $\ell^+$, in an interval of the angle~$\theta$ between the HNL and the beam axis. Our results show that NNOs should be included in collider simulations of HNLs at the FCCee.</p>

<p>2023-08-14, <strong>Calibration and Physics with ARA Station 1: A Unique Askaryan Radio Array Detector</strong>, M. F. H Seikh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07292v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07292v1</a></p>

<p>The Askaryan Radio Array Station 1 (A1), the first among five autonomous stations deployed for the ARA experiment at the South Pole, is a unique ultra-high energy neutrino (UHEN) detector based on the Askaryan effect that uses Antarctic ice as the detector medium. Its 16 radio antennas (distributed across 4 strings, each with 2 Vertically Polarized (VPol), 2 Horizontally Polarized (HPol) receivers), and 2 strings of transmitting antennas (calibration pulsers, CPs), each with 1 VPol and 1 HPol channel, are deployed at depths less than 100 m within the shallow firn zone of the 2.8 km thick South Pole (SP) ice. We apply different methods to calibrate its Ice Ray Sampler second generation (IRS2) chip for timing offset and ADC-to-Voltage conversion factors using a known continuous wave input signal to the digitizer, and achieve a precision of sub-nanoseconds. We achieve better calibration for odd, compared to even samples, and also find that the HPols under-perform relative to the VPol channels. Our timing calibrated data is subsequently used to calibrate the ADC-to-Voltage conversion as well as precise antenna locations, as a precursor to vertex reconstruction. The calibrated data will then be analyzed for UHEN signals in the final step of data compression. The ability of A1 to scan the firn region of SP ice sheet will contribute greatly towards a 5-station analysis and will inform the design of the planned IceCube Gen-2 radio array.</p>

<p>2023-08-14, <strong>Operations plans and sensitivities of the IceCube Upgrade Camera System</strong>, Steven Rodan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07276v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07276v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Upgrade consists of seven new strings to be deployed in the central region of the existing IceCube detector. The goals of the IceCube Upgrade are two-fold: to enhance sensitivity to neutrinos in the GeV range, and to improve the calibration of the IceCube detector as a means of reducing systematic uncertainties due to the optical properties of the ice. Among other calibration devices designed to study ice properties, a novel camera system will be deployed as part of the Upgrade. The system will include three cameras, each paired with an illumination LED, included in each of the Upgrade optical modules. In total, 2,300 cameras will be deployed. A combination of photographic images from transmitted and reflected light will measure optical properties of both the bulk ice in-between strings and the local ice refrozen in the drill hole. In this contribution, we present the operations plans for these two types of measurements and the sensitivities to the ice properties and geometry of the new modules that can be achieved with the new camera system.</p>

<p>2023-08-14, <strong>Multimessenger Potential of the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland</strong>, Marco Stein Muzio et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07224v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07224v1</a></p>

<p>The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) is the only ultrahigh energy (UHE, ${\gtrsim}30$~PeV) neutrino monitor of the Northern sky and will soon be the worldâs most sensitive high-uptime detector of UHE neutrinos. Because of this, RNO-G represents an important piece of the multimessenger landscape over the next decade. In this talk, we will highlight RNO-Gâs multimessenger capabilities and its potential to provide key information in the search for the most extreme astrophysical accelerators. In particular, we will highlight opportunities enabled by RNO-Gâs unique field-of-view, its potential to constrain the sources of UHE cosmic rays, and its complementarity with IceCube at lower energies.</p>

<p>2023-08-14, <strong>Probing extreme astrophysical accelerators through neutrino anisotropy</strong>, Marco Stein Muzio et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07211v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07211v1</a></p>

<p>We present the extent to which anisotropies in the ultrahigh energy neutrino sky can probe the distribution of extreme astrophysical accelerators in the universe. In this talk, we discuss the origin of an anisotropic neutrino sky and show how observers can use this anisotropy to measure the evolution of ultrahigh energy neutrino sources - and therefore, the sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays - for the very first time.</p>

<p>2023-08-14, <strong>Projections of Discovery Potentials from Expected Background</strong>, M. K. Singh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07049v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07049v1</a></p>

<p>Background with certain uncertainties are usually known in searches of novel phenomena prior to the experiments are conducted at their design stage. We quantitatively study the projected sensitivities in terms of discovery potentials. These are essential for the optimizations of the experimental specifications as well as of the cost-effectiveness in various investment. Sensitivities in counting analysis are derived with complete Poisson statistics and its continuous approximation, and are compared with those using maximum likelihood analysis in which additional measurables are included as signatures. The roles and effects due to uncertainties in the background estimates are studied. Two expected features to establish positive effects are verified and quantified: (i) In counting-only experiments, the required signal strength can be derived with complete Poisson analysis, and the continuous approximation would underestimate the results. (ii) Incorporating continuous variables as additional constraints would reduce the required signal strength relative to that of counting-only analysis. The formulations are applied to the case on the experimental searches of neutrinoless double beta decay in which both ambient and two-neutrino background are considered.</p>

<p>2023-08-14, <strong>Astro-COLIBRI: An Advanced Platform for Real-Time Multi-Messenger Astrophysics</strong>, Fabian SchÃ¼ssler et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07044v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07044v1</a></p>

<p>Observations of transient phenomena like Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), stellar flares and explosions (novae and supernovae), combined with the detection of novel cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has revolutionized astrophysics over the last years. The discovery potential of both ulti-messenger and multi-wavelength follow-up observations as well as serendipitous observations could be maximized with a novel tool which allows for quickly acquiring an overview over relevant information associated with each new detection. Here we present Astro-COLIBRI, a novel and comprehensive platform for this challenge.   Astro-COLIBRIâs architecture comprises a public RESTful API, real-time databases, a cloud-based alert system and a website as well as apps for iOS and Android as clients for users. Astro-COLIBRI evaluates incoming messages of astronomical observations from all available alert streams in real time, filters them by user specified criteria and puts them into their MWL and MM context. The clients provide a graphical representation with an easy to grasp summary of the relevant data to allow for the fast identification of interesting phenomena, provides an assessment of observing conditions at a large selection of observatories around the world, and much more.   Here the key features of Astro-COLIBRI are presented. We outline the architecture, summarize the used data resources, and provide examples for applications and use cases. Focussing on the high-energy domain, weâll discuss the use of the platform in searches for high-energy gamma-ray counterparts to high-energy neutrinos, gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves.</p>

<p>2023-08-13, <strong>Indirect dark matter search in the Galactic Centre with IceCube</strong>, Nhan Chau et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06729v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.06729v1</a></p>

<p>It is assumed that dark matter can annihilate or decay into Standard Model particles which then can produce a neutrino flux detectable at IceCube. Such a signal can be emitted from the Galactic Center thanks to the high density of dark matter abundance being gravitationally captured. This analysis aims at searching for neutrino signals from dark matter annihilation and decay in the Galactic Center using $\sim$9 years of IceCube-DeepCore data with an optimized selection for low energy. In this contribution, we present the sensitivities on the thermally averaged dark matter self-annihilation cross-section for dark matter masses ranging from 5 GeV up to 8 TeV.</p>

<p>2023-08-14, <strong>Full analysis of the scalar-induced gravitational waves for the curvature perturbation with local-type non-Gaussianities</strong>, Chen Yuan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07155v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07155v1</a></p>

<p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) are supposed to form through the gravitational collapse of regions with large density fluctuations. The formation of PBHs inevitably leads to the emission of scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) signals, offering a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis of PBHs as a constituent of dark matter (DM). Previous studies have calculated the energy spectrum of SIGWs in local-type non-Gaussian models, primarily considering the contributions from the $F_{\mathrm{NL}}$-order or the $G_{\mathrm{NL}}$-order while neglecting connected diagrams. In this study, we extend the previous work by (i) considering the full contribution of non-Gaussian diagrams up to the $G_{\mathrm{NL}}$-order; (ii) deriving the generic scaling of the SIGW energy spectrum in the infrared region. We derive semi-analytical results applicable to arbitrary primordial power spectra and numerically evaluate the energy spectrum of SIGWs for a log-normal power spectrum.</p>

<p>2023-08-14, <strong>Kinetically Coupled Scalar Fields Model and Cosmological Tensions</strong>, Gang Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07069v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07069v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we investigate the kinetically coupled early dark energy (EDE) and scalar field dark matter to address cosmological tensions. The EDE model presents an intriguing theoretical approach to resolving the Hubble tension, but it introduces challenges such as the âwhy thenâ problem of why EDE was injected during the epoch of matter-radiation equality, and exacerbates existing large-scale structure tension. Therefore, we consider the interaction between dark matter and EDE, such that the dynamics of EDE are triggered by the dark matter, and the drag effect of dark energy on dark matter suppresses structure growth, which can alleviate large-scale structure tension. We replace cold dark matter with scalar field dark matter, which has the property of suppressing structure growth on small scales. We employed the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the model parameters by utilising a variety of cosmological data, our new model reveals a non-zero coupling constant of $0.030 \pm 0.026$ at a 68\% confidence level. The coupled model yields a Hubble constant value of $72.38^{+0.71}_{-0.82}$ \,km\,/\,s\,/\,Mpc, which resolves the Hubble tension. However, similar to the EDE model, it also obtains a larger $S_8$ value compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model, further exacerbating the large-scale structure tension. The best-fit $S_8$ value for the EDE model is $0.8316$, whereas our new model yields a smaller value of $0.8134$. Additionally, the coupled model exhibits a smaller $\chi^2_\mathrm{tot}$ value compared to the EDE model and the $\Lambda$CDM model, indicating a better fit to the data.</p>

<p>2023-08-14, <strong>Dark Coloured Scalars Impact on Single and Di-Higgs Production at the LHC</strong>, Pedro Gabriel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07023v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07023v1</a></p>

<p>The search for Dark Matter (DM) at colliders is primarily pursued via the detection of missing energy in particular final states. These searches are based on the production and decay processes where final states include DM particles and at least one Standard Model (SM) particle. DM will then reveal itself as missing energy. An alternative form to get a hint of a dark sector is via loop contribution to SM processes. In this case, it is not even relevant if the new particles have their origin in the dark sector of the model. In this work we discuss the impact of an arbitrary number of coloured scalars in single Higgs and double Higgs production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and we show their complementarity. We determine the range of variation of the corrections relative to the SM for an arbitrary number of coloured scalars $n$, and discuss in more detail the cases $n=1$ and $n=2$.</p>

<p>2023-08-14, <strong>Constraints on primordial black holes in the mixed dark matter scenarios using the ratio $\rm (^3{He}+D)/H$</strong>, Yupeng Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07010v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07010v1</a></p>

<p>We derive the upper limit on the dark matter (DM) fraction in primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mixed DM scenarios. In this scenarios, a PBH can accrete weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) to form a ultracompact minihalo (UCMH) with a density profile of $\rho_{\rm DM}(r)\sim r^{-9/4}$. The energy released from UCMHs due to dark matter annihilation has influence on the photodissociation of $^{4}{\rm He}$, producing the $^{3}{\rm He}$ and the D. By requiring that the ratio $\rm (^3{He}+D)/H$ caused by UCMHs does not exceed the measured value, we derive the upper limit on the dark matter fraction in PBHs. For the canonical value of DM thermally averaged annihilation cross section $\left&lt;\sigma v\right&gt;=3\times 10^{-26}\rm cm^{3}s^{-1}$, we find that the upper limit is $f_{\rm PBH} &lt; 0.35(0.75)$ for DM mass $m_{\chi}=1(10)~\rm GeV$. Compared with other limits obtained by different astronomical measurements, although our limit is not the strongest, we provide a different way of constraining the cosmological abundance of PBHs.</p>

<p>2023-08-13, <strong>CO-CHANGES I: IRAM 30m CO Observations of Molecular Gas in the Sombrero Galaxy</strong>, Yan Jiang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06750v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.06750v1</a></p>

<p>Molecular gas plays a critical role in explaining the quiescence of star formation (SF) in massive isolated spiral galaxies, which could be a result of either the low molecular gas content and/or the low SF efficiency. We present IRAM 30m observations of the CO lines in the Sombrero galaxy (NGC~4594), the most massive spiral at $d\lesssim30\rm~Mpc$. We detect at least one of the three CO lines covered by our observations in all 13 observed positions located at the galactic nucleus and along a $\sim25\rm~kpc$-diameter dusty ring. The total extrapolated molecular gas mass of the galaxy is $M_{\rm H_2}\approx4\times10^{8}\rm~M_\odot$. The measured maximum CO gas rotation velocity of $\approx379\rm~km~s^{-1}$ suggests that NGC~4594 locates in a dark matter halo with a mass $M_{\rm200}\gtrsim10^{13}\rm~M_\odot$. Comparing to other galaxy samples, NGC~4594 is extremely gas poor and SF inactive, but the SF efficiency is apparently not inconsistent with that predicted by the Kennicutt-Schmidt law, so there is no evidence of enhanced SF quenching in this extremely massive spiral with a huge bulge. We also calculate the predicted gas supply rate from various sources to replenish the cold gas consumed in SF, and find that the galaxy must experienced a starburst stage at high redshift, then the leftover or recycled gas provides SF fuels to maintain the gradual growth of the galactic disk at a gentle rate.</p>

<p>2023-08-14, <strong>An Extensive $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$ Study of the Offset and Host Light Distributions of Type I Superluminous Supernovae</strong>, Brian Hsu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07271v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07271v1</a></p>

<p>We present an extensive $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$ ($\textit{HST}$) rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) imaging study of the locations of Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) within their host galaxies. The sample includes 65 SLSNe with detected host galaxies in the redshift range $z\approx 0.05-2$. Using precise astrometric matching with SN images, we determine the distributions of physical and host-normalized offsets relative to the host centers, as well as the fractional flux distribution relative to the underlying UV light distribution. We find that the host-normalized offsets of SLSNe roughly track an exponential disk profile, but exhibit an overabundance of sources with large offsets of $1.5-4$ times their host half-light radius. The SLSNe normalized offsets are systematically larger than those of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), and even Type Ib/c and II SNe. Furthermore, we find that about 40\% of all SLSNe occur in the dimmest regions of their host galaxies (fractional flux of 0), in stark contrast to LGRBs and Type Ib/c and II SNe. We do not detect any significant trends in the locations of SLSNe as a function of redshift, or as a function of explosion and magnetar engine parameters inferred from modeling of their optical lights curves. The significant difference in SLSN locations compared to LGRBs (and normal core-collapse SNe) suggests that at least some of their progenitors follow a different evolutionary path. We speculate that SLSNe arise from massive runaway stars from disrupted binary systems, with velocities of $\sim 10^2$ km s$^{-1}$.</p>

<p>2023-08-14, <strong>Lightcurve and spectral modelling of the Type IIb SN 2020acat. Evidence for a strong Ni bubble effect on the diffusion time</strong>, Mattias Ergon et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07158v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07158v1</a></p>

<p>We use the light curve and spectral synthesis code JEKYLL to calculate a set of macroscopically mixed Type IIb supernova (SN) models, which are compared to both previously published and new late-phase observations of SN 2020acat. The models differ in the initial mass, the radial mixing and expansion of the radioactive material, and the properties of the hydrogen envelope. The best match to the photospheric and nebular spectra and lightcurves of SN 2020acat is found for a model with an initial mass of 17 solar masses, strong radial mixing and expansion of the radioactive material, and a 0.1 solar mass hydrogen envelope with a low hydrogen mass-fraction of 0.27. The most interesting result is that strong expansion of the clumps containing radioactive material seems to be required to fit the observations of SN 2020acat both in the diffusion phase and the nebular phase. These âNi bubblesâ are expected to expand due to heating from radioactive decays, but the degree of expansion is poorly constrained. Without strong expansion there is a tension between the diffusion phase and the subsequent evolution, and models that fit the nebular phase produce a diffusion peak that is too broad. The diffusion phase lightcurve is sensitive to the expansion of the âNi bubblesâ, as the resulting Swiss-cheese-like geometry decreases the effective opacity and therefore the diffusion time. This effect has not been taken into account in previous lightcurve modelling of stripped-envelope SNe, which may lead to a systematic underestimate of their ejecta masses. It should be emphasized, though, that JEKYLL is limited to a geometry that is spherically symmetric on average, and large-scale asymmetries may also play a role. The relatively high initial mass found for the progenitor of SN 2020acat places it at the upper end of the mass distribution of Type IIb SN progenitors, and a single star origin can not be excluded.</p>

<p>2023-08-14, <strong>Late-time Cosmology without Dark Sector but with Closed String Massless Sector</strong>, Hocheol Lee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07149v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.07149v1</a></p>

<p>We propose to solve the dark energy problem by postulating the massless sector of closed strings. This sector constitutes the gravitational multiplet of string theory and, when applied to four-dimensional cosmology, predicts that the expansion of an open Universe defined in string frame is readily accelerating. We confront the prediction with the late-time cosmological data of Type Ia supernovae and quasar absorption spectrum, which probe the evolutions of the Hubble parameter and possibly the fine-structure constant. We report that the observations are in admirable agreement with the prediction without any dark sector. We estimate the Hubble constant, $H_{0}\simeq 71.2\pm 0.2\,\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$.</p>

<p>2023-08-14, <strong>A Model-independent Method to Determine $H_0$ using Time-Delay Lensing, Quasars and Type Ia Supernova</strong>, Xiaolei Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06951v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.06951v1</a></p>

<p>Absolute distances from strong lensing can anchor Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) at cosmological distances giving a model-independent inference of the Hubble constant ($H_0$). Future observations could provide strong lensing time delay distances with source redshifts up to $z\,\simeq\,4$, which are much higher than the maximum redshift of SNe Ia observed so far. Quasars are also observed at high redshifts and can be potentially used as standard candles based on a linear relation between the log of the ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray luminosities. In order to make full use of time delay distances measured at higher redshifts, we use quasars as a complementary cosmic probe to measure cosmological distances at redshifts beyond those of SNe Ia and provide a model-independent method to determine the Hubble constant. In this work, we demonstrate a model-independent, joint constraint of SNe Ia, quasars, and time-delay distances. We first generate mock datasets of SNe Ia, quasar, and time-delay distances based on a fiducial cosmological model. Then, we calibrate quasar parameters model independently using Gaussian process (GP) regression with mock SNe Ia data. Finally, we determine the value of $H_0$ model-independently using GP regression from mock quasars and time-delay distances from strong lensing systems. As a comparison, we also show the $H_0$ results obtained from mock SNe Ia in combination with time delay lensing systems whose redshifts overlap with SNe Ia. Our results show that quasars at higher redshifts show great potential to extend the redshift coverage of SNe Ia and thus enables the full use of strong lens time-delay distance measurements from ongoing cosmic surveys and improve the accuracy of the estimation of $H_0$ from $2.1\%$ to $1.3\%$.</p>

<p>2023-08-13, <strong>Chance coincidences between black hole low-mass X-ray binaries and supernova remnants</strong>, Craig O. Heinke et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06678v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.06678v1</a></p>

<p>I argue that black hole low-mass X-ray binaries (BH LMXBs) are very unlikely to be physically associated with supernova remnants (SNRs). The timescales of BH LMXBs are so much longer than those of SNRs, that there is only a 0.2% chance of any BH LMXB being identified within its natal SNR. However, the probability of a BH LMXB being projected within a SNR is significant; I estimate that 2 BH LMXBs should be projected within SNRs from our perspective. I look more closely at the suggestion by Balakrishnan and collaborators of an association between the BH X-ray binary Swift J1728.9-3613 and the SNR G351.9-0.9, and show that this is most likely a chance coincidence.</p>

<p>2023-08-13, <strong>The Impact of Angular Momentum Loss on the Outcomes of Binary Mass Transfer</strong>, Reinhold Willcox et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06666v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.06666v1</a></p>

<p>We use the rapid binary population synthesis code COMPAS to investigate commonly used prescriptions for the determination of mass transfer stability in close binaries and the orbital separations after stable mass transfer. The degree of orbital tightening during non-conservative mass transfer episodes is governed by the poorly-constrained angular momentum carried away by the ejected material. Increased orbital tightening drives systems towards unstable mass transfer leading to a common envelope. We find that the fraction of interacting binaries that will undergo only stable mass transfer throughout their lives fluctuates between a few and $\sim 20\%$ due to uncertainty in the angular momentum loss alone. If mass transfer is significantly non-conservative, stability prescriptions that rely on the assumption of conservative mass transfer under-predict the number of systems which experience unstable mass transfer and stellar mergers. This may substantially impact predictions about the rates of various transients, including luminous red novae, stripped-envelope supernovae, X-ray binaries, and the progenitors of coalescing compact binaries.</p>
