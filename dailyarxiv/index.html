<p>2025-07-09, <strong>IceCube population constraints on neutrino emission by Fermi-LAT detected active galactic nuclei</strong>, Sam Hori et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07098v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07098v1</a></p>

<p>Gamma-ray-bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been one of the most promising source classes of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. The first evidence of an IceCube point source was a blazar detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), TXS ~0506+056. Previous analyses have ruled out GeV-bright blazars as the predominant contributor to the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux under simple correlation assumptions about the relationship between the fluxes of gamma rays and neutrinos. We present results from a more general and more sensitive search for correlation between neutrinos and GeV-selected AGN using improvements in the IceCube statistical methods and 13 years of data. We detect no correlation and set stringent constraints on neutrino emission by populations of GeV-detected AGN. These include constraints on the neutrino emission from subclasses of GeV-detected AGN, including BL Lacs, flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) and non-blazar AGN, using stacking analyses testing a variety of hypothesized relationships between neutrino and gamma-ray flux. We also present results from an analysis that is sensitive to a wider range of relationships between the gamma-ray and neutrino signal.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Results from IceCube Follow-up of Nearby Supernova SN2023ixf</strong>, Alicia Mand et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07097v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07097v1</a></p>

<p>Core-collapse supernovae are of particular interest in multi-messenger astronomy due to their potential to accelerate cosmic rays and produce high-energy neutrinos. One such supernova is the recent SN2023ixf located in M101 (the Pinwheel Galaxy). It is the closest (6.4 Mpc) and brightest (B band magnitude 10.8) core-collapse supernova in nearly a decade. This supernova likely had a progenitor surrounded by dense circumstellar material which, during the supernova, may have produced neutrinos when ejecta collided with the material. I will present results of a follow-up of this supernova using data collected from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory located at the South Pole. We obtain results consistent with background expectations with time-integrated energy flux ($E^2 dN/dE$) upper limits of 0.35 GeV/cm$^2$ for a 32-day time window and 0.44 GeV/cm$^2$ for a 4-day time window, both at 90% confidence level for an $E^{-2}$ power law. These correspond to values of $2.7 \times 10^{48}$ erg for the 32-day time window and $3.5 \times 10^{48}$ erg for the 4-day time window at the supernova.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Search for GeV-PeV neutrinos from nova T Coronae Borealis with IceCube</strong>, Jessie Thwaites et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07096v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07096v1</a></p>

<p>The widely anticipated outburst of recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), which is near the end of its 80-year cycle, provides an excellent opportunity to search for neutrinos from novae. Novae are an energetic class of transients, which have been studied for hundreds of years. Because many of them are located nearby, novae provide an excellent astrophysical laboratory to study shock-powered emission in our own backyard. Several recent novae have previously been detected in GeV gamma rays, and the 2021 outburst of RS Ophiuchi was detected up to TeV energies, with evidence for a hadronic origin of the observed emission. Previous searches for GeV-TeV neutrinos from novae, predicted to occur alongside their gamma-ray emission, have been performed using data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. However, no significant neutrino signals from novae have yet been observed. We present plans for follow-up of T CrB in real time with IceCube, using datasets spanning GeV to PeV neutrino energies. Due to its closer distance and higher optical flux, which has been well measured in two historical eruptions, the expected neutrino signal from T CrB is several times stronger than that from RS Ophiuchi. Furthermore, T CrB is located in the Northern sky at a declination where IceCubeâs sensitivity is an additional factor of a few better than at the location of RS Ophiuchi, which is beneficial to this search.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Lifetime study of the ColdADC for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment</strong>, Wenjie Wu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07086v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07086v1</a></p>

<p>ColdADC is a custom ASIC digitizer implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology using specialized techniques for long-term reliability in cryogenic environments. ColdADC was developed for use in the DUNE Far Detector complex, which will consist of four liquid argon time projection chambers. Each contains 17 kilotons liquid argon as the target material in order to measure neutrino oscillations. Approximately 40,000 ColdADC ASICs will be installed for DUNE in the first two large detectors and will be operated at cryogenic temperatures during the experiment without replacement. The lifetime of the ColdADC is a critical parameter affecting the data quality and physics sensitivity of the experiment. A measurement of the lifetime of the ColdADC was carried out, and the results shown in this paper assure orders of magnitude longer lifetime of the ColdADC than the planned operation time of the detectors.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>The cosmic-ray sea explains the Galactic $Î³$-ray and $Î½$ diffuse emissions from GeV to PeV</strong>, Pedro De La Torre Luque et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07083v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07083v1</a></p>

<p>The LHAASO collaboration has recently released the spectrum and the angular distribution of the gamma-ray Galactic diffuse emission from 1 TeV to 1 PeV measured with the Kilometer-2 Array (KM2A) and the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA). We show that those data are in remarkably good agreement with a set of pre-existing models that assume the emission to be produced by the Galactic population of cosmic rays if its spectral shape traces that measured by CALET, DAMPE as well as KASCADE at higher energies. No extra-components besides the CR sea is needed to explain LHAASO results. Spatial dependent CR transport models, although not required to reproduce LHAASO results, are in better agreement with them respect to conventional ones and needed to consistently reproduce Fermi-LAT and neutrino data.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>All-Sky Cosmic-Ray Anisotropy Update at Multiple Energies</strong>, Juan Carlos DÃ­az-VÃ©lez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07070v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07070v1</a></p>

<p>We present preliminary results on an updated full-sky analysis of the cosmic-ray arrival direction distribution with data collected by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory and IceCube Neutrino Observatory with complementary field of views covering a large fraction of the sky. This study extends the energy range to higher energies. The HAWC Observatory, located at 19$^{\circ}$N has analyzed 8 years of cosmic-ray data over an energy range between 3.0 TeV and 1.0 PeV and confirms an energy-dependent anisotropy in the arrival direction distribution of cosmic rays seen by other experiments. Combined with recently published results from IceCube with 12 years of data, the combined sky maps with 93\% coverage of the sky â between 70$^{\circ}$N and 90$^{\circ}$S â and the corresponding angular power spectra largely eliminate biases that result from partial sky coverage.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Impact of Hole-ice Calibration on High Energy Event Reconstruction with the IceCube Upgrade</strong>, Kaustav Dutta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07062v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07062v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Upgrade, currently under construction at the geographic South Pole, is the next development stage of the IceCube detector. It will consist of seven new columns of novel optical sensors and advanced calibration devices densely deployed at the centre of the existing array. The sensors are frozen into the ice in boreholes created by hot water drilling. The refreezing forms hole ice around modules with optical properties that differ from the surrounding glacial ice. A key objective of the IceCube Upgrade is to enhance our understanding of the optical properties of both bulk ice and refrozen hole ice. Precise ice modelling is crucial for the directional reconstruction of TeV-PeV neutrinos, as resolutions at such high energies can be strongly impacted by uncertainties in ice properties and optical sensor response. An improved directional reconstruction performance will translate to a boost in neutrino source sensitivities using IceCube data collected over the last 12 years. In this contribution, we present the expected improvements in reconstruction performance resulting from advances in hole-ice modelling and the resulting impact on IceCubeâs sensitivity to astrophysical neutrino sources across three distinct event samples.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Very Late Afterpulses and Search for the Neutron Echo in IceCube</strong>, Kaustav Dutta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07042v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07042v1</a></p>

<p>While high-energy astrophysical neutrinos are well-established, their flavor composition remains relatively unconstrained. In IceCube, long muon tracks from $\nu_\mu$ charged-current interactions are easily identified but the detector geometry does not allow sufficient resolution to distinguish cascade-type events. The Neutron Echo - a delayed light signal in the detector from neutron capture and de-excitation - can probe the showerâs hadronic content and thus the underlying interaction. A significant background arises from late PMT afterpulses, which are temporally coincident with the physics signal. The traditional IceCube data acquisition system has a limited readout window with significant deadtime between triggers, which is insufficient to capture the late pulses. A recently developed deadtime-free readout mode, with an extended window, enables their detection. An observed excess in the delayed time spectrum over the background would be compatible with the Neutron Echo hypothesis. In this contribution, we summarize the physics scope of delayed signals, discuss the timing spectrum of signal and PMT background, highlight the capabilities of the new system for recording late pulses, and emphasize the potential of IceCube for particle identification through delayed signals.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Improvements in the Reconstruction of IceCube Realtime Alerts</strong>, Giacomo Sommani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06957v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06957v1</a></p>

<p>In 2016, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory launched its realtime program. When a neutrino candidate of likely astrophysical origin is detected, a public alert is issued, typically within one minute. These alerts allow the astrophysical community to follow up on the region of the sky where the neutrino likely originated. Initially, the system issued around six track-signature alerts per year, with a highlight being IceCube-170922A, which was later associated with the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056. Since 2019, IceCube has expanded the selection criteria for neutrino candidates, increasing the track alert rate to around 30 per year with additional alerts for cascade signatures of probable astrophysical origin implemented in 2020. This work describes several improvements in the reconstruction of track alerts, which were introduced into the realtime stream in 2024, and details the two algorithms that are alternately used for reconstruction, depending on the reconstructed muon energy. The improvements result in more precise directional localizations, with a factor of 5 (4) reduction in the 50% (90%) contour area. Systematic errors affecting the reconstructions, such as the ice model or the geometry of the detector, have also been investigated to ensure statistical coverage. In addition to its application in the realtime stream, the improvements described here are also being applied to historical alerts with an updated catalog of track alerts forthcoming.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Inverse Seesaw Model in Non-holomorphic Modular $A_4$ Flavor Symmetry</strong>, Xianshuo Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06945v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06945v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate an inverse seesaw model of neutrino masses based on non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry, by extending the framework of modular-invariant flavor models beyond the conventional holomorphic paradigm. After establishing the general theoretical framework, we analyze three concrete model realizations distinguished by their $A_4$ representation assignments and modular weight configurations for the matter fields. Focusing on these three specific realizations, we perform a comprehensive analysis of neutrino phenomenology. By constraining the modulus parameter $\tau$ to the fundamental domain and systematically scanning the parameter space, we identify regions compatible with current neutrino oscillation data. Our numerical results provide predictions for currently unmeasured quantities, including the absolute neutrino mass scale, Dirac CP-violating phase, and Majorana phases. These predictions establish specific, testable signatures for upcoming neutrino experiments, particularly in neutrinoless double beta decay and precision oscillation measurements. The framework offers a well-defined target for future experimental verification or exclusion, while demonstrating the phenomenological viability of non-holomorphic modular symmetry approaches to flavor structure.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Search for High Energy Neutrinos from Infrared Flares</strong>, Teresa Pernice et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06934v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06934v1</a></p>

<p>IceCube has detected a diffuse flux of high-energy neutrinos, whose origin still remains uncertain. Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been proposed as plausible sources of neutrinos. Candidate sources include AT2019dsg, which is likely a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), and AT2019dfr, an AGN flare. Both present delayed emission in the IR band with respect to the optical signal. This emission can be interpreted as the reprocessing of X-rays to optical light of the flare by dust located in a torus around the SMBH. An additional study using an optically detected sample of 63 accretion flares revealed another candidate as a potential high-energy neutrino counterpart: AT2019aalc, which is also accompanied by a dust echo. However, follow-up stacking analysis of the 63 nuclear flares using the full IceCube data sample did not show any significant excess over background. Motivated by these three suggested neutrino-TDE correlations, we analyze a more extensive catalog of IR flares, 823 dust-echo-like flares identified using WISE satellite data, against the IceCube 10-year sample of track events from the Northern Sky. Our analysis aims to perform sensitivity studies and assess the potential detectability of neutrino emission from these types of accretion flares. In addition, we carry out a correlation study of the 823 dust echo-like flares against a revised catalog of IceCube high-purity astrophysical alerts, and reevaluate the previous study of 63 nuclear flares against the same revised alerts sample.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Neutrino flavor composition using High Energy Starting Events with IceCube</strong>, Neha Lad et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06835v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06835v1</a></p>

<p>Astrophysical neutrinos provide crucial insights into their sources and play a key role in multi-messenger astronomy. The neutrino flavor composition at Earth allows us to probe the mechanisms of neutrino production and cosmic ray acceleration, as well as the properties of the environments in which they originate. Understanding the flavor composition also offers a unique opportunity to test new physics in the neutrino sector. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory consists of 1 km$^3$ of ice instrumented with photomultipliers that detect neutrinos through Cherenkov radiation from their interaction products. Different neutrino interactions result in distinct event topologies, such as tracks, cascades, and double cascade events, which allow for the identification of the interacting neutrino type and measurement of the flavor composition of the astrophysical neutrino flux. In this contribution we present the results of the measurement of the flavor ratio of the High-Energy Starting Event Selection based on 12 years of data, a high-purity sample of neutrino interactions that occur inside the detector. In addition, we discuss various methods that could further improve the analysis in the future.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>A Search for Astrophysical Neutrinos from Flaring X-ray Binaries with IceCube</strong>, Alina Kochocki et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06807v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06807v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, IceCube has observed an excess of astrophysical neutrinos from the Galactic plane. Such a signal may indicate the presence of individual sources or a diffuse neutrino flux from the interactions of Galactic, hadronic cosmic rays. We consider the prospect of neutrino production in galactic X-ray binary systems. A model for neutrino production in the variable jets of these systems is discussed, and how such information may be incorporated within searches for astrophysical neutrinos from these sources. Two ongoing studies are presented on behalf of the IceCube Collaboration using 13 years of cascades and track-like events. In the first study, recently published model predictions are used to motivate the analysis of five selected black-hole X-ray binaries. Gamma-ray data from Fermi-LAT, as well as X-ray data from Swift/BAT and MAXI are used to search for temporal correlations between radiative cycles of the disk-jet system and potential neutrino emission. In the second study, a wider selection of variable X-ray binaries and their Swift/BAT light curves is considered and a stacking search is used to constrain the contribution of this source population to the Galactic neutrino flux.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Denoising radio pulses from air showers using machine-learning methods</strong>, AurÃ©lien Benoit-LÃ©vy et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06688v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06688v1</a></p>

<p>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect radio signals from extensive air showers (EAS) caused by ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic particles. Galactic, hardware-like, and anthropogenic noise are expected to contaminate these signals. To address this problem, we propose training a supervised convolutional network known as an encoder-decoder. This network is used to learn a coded representation of the data and remove specific features from it. This denoiser is trained using high-fidelity air shower simulations specifically tailored to replicate the characteristics of signals detected by GRAND. In this contribution, we describe our machine-learning model and report initial results demonstrating the sensitivity enhancement resulting from our denoising algorithm when applied to realistically simulated GRAND signals with varying signal-to-noise ratios.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Using End-to-End Optimized Summary Statistics to Improve IceCubeâs Diffuse Galactic Fits</strong>, Oliver Janik et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06666v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06666v1</a></p>

<p>Characterizing the astrophysical neutrino flux with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory traditionally relies on a binned forward-folding likelihood approach. Insufficient Monte Carlo (MC) statistics in each bin limits the granularity and dimensionality of the binning scheme. A neural network can be employed to optimize a summary statistic that serves as the input for data analysis, yielding the best possible outcomes. This end-to-end optimized summary statistic allows for the inclusion of more observables while maintaining adequate MC statistics per bin. This work will detail the application of end-to-end optimized summary statistics in analyzing and characterizing the galactic neutrino flux, achieving improved resolution in the likelihood contours for selected signal parameters and models.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Calculation of the exposure of GRANDProto300 to cosmic rays</strong>, Sei Kato et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06629v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06629v1</a></p>

<p>GRANDProto300 is one of the prototype experiments of the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection. It will feature about 300 radio antenna detectors in Xiaodushang in Dunhuang, China, covering a total geometrical area of about 200 km$^2$. A main scientific goal of GRANDProto300 is the study of cosmic rays in the transition region ($10^{17}\, {\rm eV} &lt; E &lt; 10^{18.5}\, {\rm eV}$). Our study calculates the exposure of GRANDProto300 to cosmic rays and estimates the number of cosmic-ray events to be detected during a fixed observation period. The trigger efficiency reaches 50, 80, and 90% at $10^{17.5}$, $10^{17.9}$, and $10^{18.3}\, {\rm eV}$, respectively. The exposure of GRANDProto300 is 50 km$^2$ day sr at around $10^{17.5}$ eV, and the expected number of observed cosmic rays with energies above $10^{17}$ eV and zenith angles above 65$^{\circ}$ is about 130 events per day. GRANDProto300 will be able to measure the cosmic-ray energy spectrum in $10^{17.2}\, {\rm eV} &lt; E &lt; 10^{19.5}\, {\rm eV}$ through one-year observation, with a statistical precision about five times better than the previous spectral measurement by a mono-fluorescence detector of the Telescope Array Low-Energy Extension. The statistical uncertainty in the measurement of the mean depth of the air-shower maximum $X_{\rm max}$ is about five times better than the previous measurements using radio detectors at $10^{17.5}$ eV; systematic uncertainties should be a dominant contribution limiting our interpretation of the chemical composition of cosmic rays in the transition region.</p>

<p>The detection of transient phenomena such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), stellar flares, novae, and supernovae, alongside novel cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves, has transformed astrophysics in recent years. Maximizing the discovery potential of multi-messenger and multi-wavelength follow-up observations, as well as serendipitous detections, requires a tool that rapidly compiles and contextualizes relevant information for each new event. We present Astro-COLIBRI, an advanced platform designed to meet this challenge.   Astro-COLIBRI integrates a public RESTful API, real-time databases, a cloud-based alert system, and user-friendly clients (a website and mobile apps for iOS and Android). It processes astronomical alerts from multiple streams in real time, filtering them based on user-defined criteria and placing them in their multi-wavelength and multi-messenger context. The platform offers intuitive data visualization, a quick summary of relevant event properties, and an assessment of observing conditions at numerous observatories worldwide.   We here describe its architecture, data resources, and main functionalities. We highlight the automatic collection of photometric data from a variety of large scale optical surveys, a recently added feature that significantly improves the capabilities of the Astro-COLIBRI platform.</p>

<p>This work introduces a model for lepton mass generation and flavor mixing, realized through a (2,3) inverse seesaw structure within a modular ( S_4 ) symmetry framework. The model employs modular forms to construct the lepton Yukawa couplings, thereby significantly simplifying the model by reducing its complexity. A detailed numerical analysis demonstrates consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, yielding constrained predictions for the mixing angles and CP-violating phases. The Dirac CP phase is sharply localized near ( \delta_{\rm CP} \sim 359^\circ ), and the model predicts an effective Majorana mass ( |m_{ee}| \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \,\text{eV} ), Within the scope of upcoming experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay such as nEXO and AMoRE-II. The model also remains consistent with current bounds on charged lepton flavor violating processes from MEG and BaBar. We further explore resonant leptogenesis enabled by quasi-degenerate heavy neutrino states, and show that observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be succesfully generated within this framework. The combined treatment of low-energy observables and high-scale baryogenesis demonstrates the predictivity and testability of the modular ( S_4 )-based ISS(2,3) framework.</p>

<p>IceCube is a neutrino observatory located at the South Pole that uses Antarctic ice as a medium for detection of Cherenkov photons. As such, analysis of the data relies on our understanding of the properties of ice within and around the instrumented volume. Over the years we have made significant progress in understanding the glacial ice and now have a comprehensive model that covers many of the relevant aspects of the photon propagation in it. In this report we give a historical overview of the ice description within the IceCube detector, list some of the remaining issues, and assess how much more improvement is still needed. As the IceCube Upgrade is expected to be installed in less than a year, with several new types of calibration devices aiming to further our understanding of ice, this is the perfect time to review the current state of the ice model.</p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer Cherenkov array deployed in the deep, glacial ice at the geographic South Pole. An important feature of the instrumented ice are undulations of layers of constant optical properties over the footprint of the detector. During detector construction, these layers were mapped using stratigraphy measurements obtained from a stand-alone laser dust logger. While this system is very precise, its cost does not scale to the instrumented volume envisioned for the proposed IceCube-Gen2 Observatory. Here, we explore the possibility of obtaining equivalent stratigraphy data from camera footage recorded during the deployment of IceCube more than a decade ago. If successful, this could be an alternative technique to be considered for IceCube-Gen2.</p>

<p>Multimessenger astronomy seeks to uncover the origins of cosmic rays and neutrinos. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory plays a key role in monitoring the sky for revealing high energy neutrinos and neutrino time clusters possibly associated with astrophysical sources, issuing alerts to the astrophysical community for significant excesses. This enables joint observations with other astronomical facilities that could reveal the hidden mechanisms behind the most extreme environments in the Universe. In particular, since 2006 the Gamma-ray Follow-Up (GFU) program shares cluster alerts with partner Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes. The faint cosmic signals, searched against large atmospheric backgrounds, are widely masked by the statistical penalties that arise when scanning the full sky in an unbiased way. Hence, targeted analyses of pre-selected neutrino source candidates have proven to increase our search sensitivity. Our understanding of astrophysical environments has improved in recent years, with evidence of neutrino emission from the blazar TXS 0506+056 and the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. The aim of expanding observational possibilities and engaging the broader scientific community through public cluster alerts has motivated the creation of a new list of target sources to be monitored by IceCube. This contribution presents the systematic compilation of this list, which extends the well-established focus on gamma-ray bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) to include X-ray bright AGN and binary systems.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>12-Years Observation of Seasonal Variation of Atmospheric Neutrino Flux with IceCube</strong>, Shuyang Deng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06155v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06155v1</a></p>

<p>High-energy atmospheric muon neutrinos are detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory with a high rate of almost a hundred thousand events per year. Being mainly produced in meson decays in cosmic-ray-induced air showers in the upper atmosphere, the flux of these neutrinos is expected to depend on atmospheric conditions and thus features a seasonal variation. The correlation between temperature fluctuations and variations of the neutrino rates can be described with a slope parameter $\alpha$, whose previous measurement with 6 years of IceCube data indicated a discrepancy to theoretical expectations. In this work, we present an update of the previous analysis, extending the statistics to 12-years of IceCube data, as well as adding a region in the Northern Hemisphere to the analysis. We estimate the slope parameter in the Southern Hemisphere to be $\alpha=0.325\pm0.022$, which confirms the previous observation of the tension between the theoretical predictions and experimental measurements with significance $&gt;3\sigma$. Furthermore, the seasonal variation in the Northern Hemisphere has also been observed for the first time, with $\alpha=0.731\pm0.222$. Investigations into systematic effects reveal that the observations not only show a weaker correlation compared to the predictions, but also deviate from the expected linear relation between the atmospheric neutrino flux and the atmospheric temperature.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Impact of flavour coupling on $SO(10)$-inspired leptogenesis</strong>, Pasquale Di Bari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06144v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06144v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the impact of flavour coupling on the predictions of low energy neutrino parameters from $SO(10)$-inspired leptogenesis (SO10INLEP). The right-handed (RH) neutrino mass spectrum is strongly hierarchical and successful leptogenesis relies on generating the asymmetry from next-to-lightest RH neutrino decays ($N_2$-leptogenesis) and circumventing the lightest RH neutrino washout. These two conditions yield distinctive predictions such as a lower bound on the lightest neutrino mass $m_1 \gtrsim 1\,{\rm meV}$. We first review the status of SO10INLEP, noticing how cosmological observations are now testing a particular neutrino mass window, $m_1 \simeq (10$â$30)\,{\rm meV}$, where only the first octant is allowed and a large range of values for the Dirac phase is excluded. Including flavour coupling, we find that the lower bound relaxes to $m_1 \gtrsim 0.65\,{\rm meV}$. Moreover, new muon-dominated solutions appear slightly relaxing the upper bound on the atmospheric mixing angle. We also study the impact on strong thermal SO10INLEP (ST-SO10INLEP) scenario where, in addition to successful leptogenesis, one can washout a large pre-existing asymmetry. Contrarily to naive expectations, for which flavour coupling could jeopardise the scenario, allowing a large pre-existing asymmetry to survive unconditionally, we show, and explain analytically, that ST-SO10INLEP is still viable within almost the same allowed region of parameters. There is even a slight relaxation of the $m_1$ viable window from (9â30)meV to (4â40)meV for a $10^{-3}$ pre-existing asymmetry. The new results from atmospheric neutrinos, mildly favouring normal ordering and first octant, are now in nice agreement with the predictions of ST-SO10INLEP. Intriguingly, the predicted $0\nu\beta\beta$ signal is starting to be within the reach of KamLAND-Zen.</p>

<p>Recently, the IceCube Collaboration reported evidence for TeV neutrino emission from several nearby Seyfert galaxies, with the highest significance found for NGC 1068. Assuming stochastic proton acceleration in magnetized turbulence inside the corona, we model the neutrino emission of Seyfert galaxies as a function of their X-ray luminosity. Applying our model to NGC 1068, we obtain a good fit to the public IceCube data and constrain the coronal radius to $\lesssim 5 R_S$ by comparing our MeV $\gamma$-ray predictions to Fermi-LAT observations. Extending to the full Seyfert population, we estimate their diffuse neutrino contribution and find that they can explain a significant fraction of the observed flux below $10\,\mathrm{TeV}$. However, scenarios with highly turbulent coronae and high cosmic-ray pressure across the population are ruled out. In particular, if all sources shared the best-fit parameters obtained for NGC 1068, their cumulative neutrino emission would exceed current upper limits at TeV energies by $3.8\sigma$. Our results, informed by both neutrino and $\gamma$-ray data, show that those Seyfert galaxies that emerge as neutrino point sources must be exceptionally efficient neutrino emitters and are not representative of the broader population.</p>

<p>The diffuse Galactic neutrino flux is produced by cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium. The measurement of this flux can help to understand the distribution of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. The first observation of this neutrino flux was published in 2023 by the IceCube Collaboration. Here, plans for a new analysis combining different event topologies are presented. IceCube measures events in two main topologies. Tracks, originating in charged current $\nu_\mu$ interactions, provide a better angular resolution. In contrast, cascades, from most other possible interactions, provide a better energy resolution and are able to observe the Southern sky (and therefore the Galactic Center) despite the huge background of atmospheric muons. Combining both event topologies in one analysis exploits all these advantages. Sensitivities and model discrimination power of a combined measurement using a forward folding binned likelihood fit are discussed here.</p>

<p>The detection of TeV neutrinos from the LHC by the far-forward detectors FASER and SND@LHC enables a plethora of novel physics opportunities. Among these, the measurement of the flavour, energy, and rapidity dependence of the LHC forward neutrino fluxes provides unique constraints on theoretical predictions of forward particle production in hadronic collisions. We demonstrate that neutrino event yield measurements at FASER from Run 3 and at its HL-LHC upgrades enable a theory-agnostic extraction of the LHC forward neutrino fluxes. We exploit the equivalence of the problem with the determination of parton distributions from deep-inelastic structure functions to apply the NNPDF approach, based on machine learning regression and the Monte Carlo replica method, to LHC neutrino fluxes. The resulting NN$\nu$flux methodology is validated through closure tests and applied to a first extraction of the LHC muon neutrino flux from the FASER 2024 data. We show how NN$\nu$flux can discriminate between event generators of forward hadron production; scrutinize a possible intrinsic charm component in the proton; and constrain BSM scenarios with enhanced decays of neutral hadrons into neutrinos.</p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory utilizes the Cherenkov radiation emitted by charged secondary particles produced in interactions of neutrinos with ice nucleons to detect neutrino events. âStarting eventsâ, where this interaction vertex is contained inside the detector volume, can be used to distinguish neutrinos from the dominant background of atmospheric through-going muons. We present the Medium Energy Starting Events (MESE) selection, which employs a series of vetoes to obtain a neutrino-pure sample to measure the flux of diffuse extragalactic neutrinos from 1 TeV to 10 PeV from the entire sky. In this talk we will present a measurement of the spectrum of the diffuse flux of neutrinos, which demonstrates strong evidence for structure in the spectrum beyond a single power law, with a significance of $4.2\,\sigma$.</p>

<p>A right-handed neutrino is a promising candidate for dark matter (DM) which has no interaction with nuclei. Since two right-handed neutrinos explain neutrino oscillation data and baryon number asymmetry through seesaw mechanism and leptogenesis based on the out-of-equilibrium decay of the lighter one, the lightest third right-handed neutrino could be free from them and stable to be DM. It suggests a possibility that the right-handed neutrinos could be common key particles for the explanation of three problems in the standard model (SM). We study this possibility by analyzing the structure of a neutrino mass matrix in the scotogenic model for neutrino mass.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Search for Sub-Relativistic Magnetic Monopoles with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</strong>, Jonas HÃ¤uÃler et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05896v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05896v1</a></p>

<p>Magnetic monopoles are beyond standard model particles, predicted by Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) to be created during the early universe. At typical masses of the GUT-scale - above $10^{14}$ GeV - these particles would move at sub-relativistic speeds. The Rubakov-Callan effect predicts that magnetic monopoles can catalyze nucleon decays, in particular the decay of protons. This results in a unique signature of small particle cascades along the trajectory of the slow moving magnetic monopole. Since 2012, a dedicated Slow-Particle Filter has been implemented in the IceCube Neutrino Observatory for the detection of magnetic monopoles. Current limits set an upper bound for the monopole flux at $\Phi_{\mathrm{90}}\leq 10^{-17}$ to $10^{-18} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$ depending on the catalysis cross section for the proton decay. A detection of the monopole flux thus requires exceptional background rejection and signal efficiency. This is accomplished using machine learning methods. In this analysis, we use a multi-level boosted decision tree classifier. We present the strategy behind the background and signal simulation, the classification efficiency, and IceCubeâs projected sensitivity for the detection of sub-relativistic magnetic monopoles.</p>

<p>IceCube-Gen2 is a proposed neutrino observatory at the South Pole that will build on the success of IceCube and will also serve as a unique detector for cosmic-ray air showers. Analogous to the IceTop surface array over IceCubeâs deep optical detector, IceCube-Gen2 will also feature a surface array above the optical array deep in the ice. As improvement over IceTop, the IceCube-Gen2 surface array will be comprised of elevated detectors to avoid snow coverage, and will combine two types of detectors: scintillation panels that measure air-shower particles on ground and enable a low detection threshold, which is important to serve as a veto for selecting downgoing neutrino candidates, and radio antennas which increase the measurement accuracy for air showers by providing a calorimetric measurement of the electromagnetic shower component and its depth of maximum, $X_\mathrm{max}$. As another major advantage, the eight times larger surface area combined with a larger field of view will provide a 30-fold increase for the aperture of surface-deep coincident events. With these improvements in statistics and measurement accuracy, IceCube-Gen2 will thus make unique contributions to the particle physics and astrophysics of Galactic cosmic rays in the PeV to EeV energy range, including the search for PeV photon sources. This proceeding summarizes the technical design and science case enabled by the IceCube-Gen2 Surface Array.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Improved Gamma-Hadron Separation for PeV Photon Searches with IceCube (ICRC 2025)</strong>, Frank G. SchrÃ¶der et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05833v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05833v1</a></p>

<p>IceTop, the km$^2$ surface array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole, is sensitive to air showers of all primary particles, including gamma rays. In particular, in the PeV energy range, the combination of IceTop and IceCubeâs deep optical detector provides excellent gamma-hadron separation. Almost all air showers induced by cosmic-ray protons and heavier nuclei in this energy range contain high-energy muons detectable by the deep detector, while most photon-induced air showers do not. Therefore, IceCubeâs deep detector can be used to strongly suppress hadronic background in photon searches. Furthermore, the lateral distribution of the air-shower signal in IceTop provides additional gamma-hadron separation. In the PeV energy range, the gamma-hadron separation achieved is better than $10^{-3}$: air-shower events measured with IceCube are suppressed more than 1000 times stronger than photon-induced showers of the same energy simulated with Sibyll 2.3d. This improved gamma-hadron separation in combination with an extension of the energy range to lower energies provides discovery potential for future searches for PeV photon sources in IceCubeâs field of view.</p>

<p>Various theoretical models predict cosmic neutrinos with multi-PeV energies. The recent detection of a ~10^17 eV neutrino in the KM3NeT experiment suggests that these energetic particles can be studied with present-day installations. Here, we present upper limits on the flux of astrophysical neutrinos with energies (10^15.5 - 10^20) eV obtained with the largest liquid-water neutrino telescope, Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector (GVD), using cascade-like events. We discuss astrophysical implications of these results and constrain several cosmogenic neutrino scenarios using a combination of Baikal-GVD, KM3NeT, IceCube and Auger data.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Quantitative U/Th deposition and cleanliness control strategies in the JUNO site air</strong>, Jie Zhao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05759v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05759v1</a></p>

<p>The Jiangmen underground neutrino observatory (JUNO) is made of a 20 kt liquid scintillator (LS) detector at a depth of 700 m underground. In order to meet all physics requirements, the $^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th content in the LS is required to reach a level of 10$^{-17}$ g/g. However, the radioactivity of dust in the air is about 12 orders of magnitude higher than that, so there is an extremely high requirement for the cleanliness of the installation environment on site. In this study, a clean room management mode was implemented in the 120,000 m$^3$ space of the JUNO underground experimental main hall, to control the environmental cleanliness at a level equivalent to a class 10,000-100,000 clean room. Additionally, we designed a method to directly measure the deposition rate of $^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th on the surface of the detector. Based on ICP-MS detection, the sensitivity to $^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th concentrations can reach the level of picograms (pg). This helps to implement the cleanliness control strategies and to assess the level of external contamination during the construction of the detector.</p>

<p>Radio emissions from extensive air showers (EAS) provide a valuable tool for detecting ultra-high-energy (UHE) astroparticles. In this context, several radio arrays focus on detecting highly inclined EAS, as this enables the observation of Earth-skimming UHE neutrinos, in addition to cosmic rays and gamma rays. The reconstruction of such inclined events relies heavily on a thorough understanding of the radio features observed on the ground, with the Cherenkov cone being one of the most prominent. In this study, we demonstrate that the Cherenkov cone can be accurately described for inclined air showers using basic propagation principles. Furthermore, we have developed an analytical model that computes the expected opening angles of the cone and reproduces the asymmetry effects observed in simulations. The high accuracy of these computations can enhance current reconstruction methods and pave the way for the development of new ones.</p>

<p>After the successful measurement of the Higgs-like particle at the Large Hadron Collider, the determination of whether it corresponds to either the minimal version of the Higgs scalar, provided by the Standard Model, or to some new physics, so far unknown, has become a main objective of the high-energy-physics community. In particular, the investigation of the couplings of this particle with the rest of the Standard-Model field content is a central task. To this aim, in the present paper we consider a variant of the seesaw neutrino-mass-generating mechanism in which the masses of light neutrinos are generated via radiative corrections of the neutrino 2-point function. In this framework, we calculate the contributions from virtual Majorana neutrinos to the $WWh$ vertex, at one loop. A set of anomalous couplings, some of them $CP$-even and the others $CP$-odd, emerge from this calculation. We perform numerical estimations of these anomalous couplings by taking into account the role of the $WWh$ vertex in (1) $Wh$ production from $pp$ collisions and (2) in Higgs production by vector-boson fusion, occurring in some lepton collider. Our estimations show that all the generated anomalous couplings are beyond current experimental sensitivity. However, we note that $CP$-conserving anomalous couplings could be as large as $\sim10^{-3}$, which would be near the reach of the high-luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider. On the other hand, $CP$-odd effects, amounting to $\sim10^{-4}$, turn out to be well below expectations for the Compact Linear Collider by about 2 orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>We present a concrete realization of tribrid inflation within the framework of the gauge group $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$. In this model, inflation is driven by the neutral components of left-handed Higgs triplets, which also play a central role in generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via non-thermal leptogenesis. Tiny neutrino masses arise naturally through a type-II seesaw mechanism, facilitated by right-handed triplet fields. Supergravity corrections, stemming from the leading-order terms in a non-minimal K"ahler potential, are essential in bringing the predictions of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ into agreement with the latest cosmological data, including the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6, Planck 2018, and LB-BK18. A key feature of this model is the existence of a viable parameter space that predicts potentially observable primordial gravitational waves, with a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 0.005$, placing it within reach of upcoming experiments.</p>

<p>We consider a simple Higgs portal dark matter (DM) model, where the Standard Model is extended with a complex singlet scalar. The imaginary part of the scalar becomes a massive and stable pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, serving as the DM candidate, while the real part gives rise to a second (dark) Higgs boson. We focus on the freeze-in production of the DM, paying particular attention to low-reheating temperature scenarios, where the dark Higgs can be a long-lived particle (LLP). We also explore the phenomenology of this dark Higgs at the LHC and the Future Circular Collider in hadron-hadron mode, discussing its discovery prospects in regions of parameter space consistent with current DM constraints. Our results emphasize the impact of the cosmic reheating dynamics on the DM freeze-in production and their critical role in interpreting collider signatures. Furthermore, our findings suggest that LLP searches may provide insights into the fundamental dynamics of reheating.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>Resolving the QCD Axion Domain Wall Problem with a Light Axion</strong>, Junseok Lee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07075v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.07075v1</a></p>

<p>We propose two novel solutions to the domain wall problem of the QCD axion by introducing a massless or light axion that also couples to gluons. The first solution applies when the new axion forms strings after inflation. Due to its mixing with the QCD axion, domain walls of the QCD axion are bounded by these strings and confined into cosmologically safe string bundles. This scenario predicts the existence of such string bundles, which may survive until today and leave observable signatures, such as gravitational waves, cosmic birefringence, and CMB anisotropies. The simultaneous detection of the QCD axion and any of these cosmological signatures would serve as a smoking-gun signal. The second solution assumes a homogeneous initial condition for the new axion. If it is sufficiently light, its potential temporarily induces a bias in the QCD axion potential before the onset of oscillations, rendering the domain walls unstable. In both scenarios, the Peccei-Quinn mechanism remains effective, and the strong CP problem is not reintroduced. We identify the viable parameter regions and discuss the resulting dark matter abundance.</p>

<p>Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which a solar mass compact object is whirling around a supermassive black hole, act as precise tracers of the spacetime geometry and astrophysical environment around the supermassive black hole. These systems are highly sensitive to even the smallest deviations from the vacuum general relativity scenario. However, detecting these signals requires highly accurate waveform modeling up to the first post-adiabatic order, incorporating self-force effects, system parameters, and environmental influences. In this paper, we focus on the impact of dark matter on gravitational waveforms. Cold dark matter in galactic centers can be redistributed by the gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole, forming a dense, spike-like profile. When an EMRI evolves in such an environment, the interaction between the binary and the surrounding dark matter can leave distinctive imprints on the emitted waveform, and thus offer a novel way to probe the nature and distribution of dark matter. We specifically examine how dark matter modifies the background spacetime. By treating these modifications perturbatively, we present a framework to incorporate dark matter environmental effects into gravitational waveform modeling at the first post-adiabatic order.</p>

<p>While cosmic voids are now recognized as a valuable cosmological probe, identifying them in a galaxy catalog is challenging for multiple reasons: observational effects such as holes in the mask or magnitude selection hinder the detection process; galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution; and it is non-trivial to estimate the detection significance and parameter uncertainties for individual voids. Our goal is to extract a catalog of voids from constrained simulations of the large-scale structure that are consistent with the observed galaxy positions, effectively representing statistically independent realizations of the probability distribution of the cosmic web. This allows us to carry out a full Bayesian analysis of the structures emerging in the Universe. We use 50 posterior realizations of the large-scale structure in the Manticore-Local suite, obtained from the 2M++ galaxies. Running the VIDE void finder on each realization, we extract 50 independent void catalogs. We perform a posterior clustering analysis to identify high-significance voids at the 5$\sigma$ level, and we assess the probability distribution of their properties. We produce a catalog of 100 voids with high statistical significance, available at https://voids.cosmictwin.org/, including the probability distributions of the centers and radii of the voids. We characterize the morphology of these regions, effectively producing a template for density environments that can be used in astrophysical applications such as galaxy evolution studies. While providing the community with a detailed catalog of voids in the nearby Universe, this work also constitutes an approach to identifying cosmic voids from galaxy surveys that allows us to account rigorously for the observational systematics intrinsic to direct detection, and provide a Bayesian characterization of their properties.</p>

<p>2025-07-09, <strong>The Bispectrum of Intrinsic Alignments: II. Precision Comparison Against Dark Matter Simulations</strong>, Thomas Bakx et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06818v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06818v1</a></p>

<p>We measure three-dimensional bispectra of halo intrinsic alignments (IA) and dark matter overdensities in real space from N-body simulations for halos of mass $10^{12}-10^{12.5} M_\odot /h$. We show that their multipoles with respect to the line of sight can be accurately described by a tree-level perturbation theory model on large scales ($k\lesssim 0.11\,h$/Mpc) at $z=0$. For these scales and in a simulation volume of 1 Gpc/$h$, we detect the bispectrum monopole $B_{\delta\delta E}^{00}$ at $\sim 30\sigma$ and the two quadrupoles $B_{\delta \delta E}^{11}$ and $B_{\delta \delta E}^{20}$ at $\sim 25\sigma$ and $\sim 15\sigma$, respectively. We also report similar detection significances for the lowest order multipoles of $B_{\delta EE}$ and $B_{EEE}$, although these are largely driven by stochastic contributions. We show that the first and second order EFT parameters are consistent with those obtained from fitting the IA power spectrum analysis at next-to-leading order, without requiring any priors to break degeneracies for the quadratic bias parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of higher multipole moments of $B_{\delta\delta E}$ greatly reduces the errors on second order bias parameters, by factors of 5 or more. The IA bispectrum thus provides an effective means of determining higher order shape bias parameters, thereby characterizing the scale dependence of the IA signal. We also detect parity-odd bispectra such as $B_{\delta \delta B}$ and $B_{\delta EB}$ at $\sim 10 \sigma$ significance or more for $k&lt;0.15\,h$/Mpc and they are fully consistent with the parity-even sector. Furthermore, we check that the Gaussian covariance approximation works reasonably well on the scales we consider here. These results lay the groundwork for using the bispectrum of IA in cosmological analyses.</p>

<p>Monopoles have been a subject of much theoretical and experimental research since they were proposed to symmetrize Maxwells equations. However, no experimental signature of their existence has been detected. Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain this lack of success. In here we generalize QED to a two photon theory where the magnetic photon and the monopole belong to dark matter. A naive mixing interaction produces duality and generates experimental consequences for indirect monopole detection via the magnetic charge of the electron.</p>

<p>The Dark MAtter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) instrument is a space-born cosmic-ray detector, capable of measuring ion fluxes up to $\sim$500 TeV/n. This energy scale is made accessible through its calorimeter, which is the deepest currently operating in orbit. Saturation of the calorimeter readout channels start occurring above $\sim$100 TeV of incident energy, and can significantly affect the primary energy reconstruction. Different techniques, analytical and machine-learning based, have been developed to tackle this issue, focusing on the recovery of single-bar deposits, up to several hundreds of TeV. In this work, a new machine-learning technique is presented, which profit of a unique model to correct the total deposited energy in DAMPE calorimeter. The described method is able to generalise its corrections for different ions and extend the maximum detectable incident energy to the PeV scale.</p>

<p>We explore the phenomenology of the ``Dark Walkerââ â an $\text{SU}(3)$ theory with eight flavors of fundamental fermions in the dark sector. During inflation, its walking dynamics generate primordial non-Gaussianities through the exchange of unparticles, while accounting for the current dark matter relic abundance if the resulting massive pseudoscalars behave as strongly interacting massive particles (SIMPs). This provides a simple yet concrete example of a strongly coupled sector during inflation.</p>

<p>We present a pedagogical introduction to the direct search of axions as dark matter, as well as to searches for solar axions. The plethora of experimental searches exploit the axionâs coupling to two photons: They attempt to convert the axion dark matter to photons in a resonator placed in an external magnetic field or convert solar axions into X-rays in a magnet pointing towards the sun. We give a basic introduction to this concept, its many variants and to searches that exploit the axionâs other couplings. We also speculate about potentially transformative developments for such searches in the near-term future.</p>

<p>Understanding the nature and evolution of dark energy (DE) is a central challenge in modern cosmology. In this work, we explore the constraining power of bright standard sirens â gravitational wave (GW) events with electromagnetic counterparts - for probing the DE equation of state as function of redshift. Focusing on future GW observations from next-generation ground-based GW detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, we perform a comprehensive analysis using simulated binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) events over five years of observation with a $75\%$ duty cycle. We consider three broad classes of DE models: (i) phenomenological parametrizations, specifically the Barboza-Alcaniz extension to the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder model; (ii) physically motivated scalar field scenarios, specifically hilltop quintessence; and (iii) evolving dark matter setup in which the matter density evolves as $(1+z)^{3+\alpha}$. For each case, we jointly infer the Hubble constant $H_0$ and model-specific DE parameters from the observed GW luminosity distances and spectroscopic redshifts. Our results demonstrate that bright sirens alone can yield competitive and independent constraints on the time evolution of DE indicating that multi-messenger cosmology has the potential to test a wide range of DE theories, bridging phenomenological and physically motivated models, and paving the way for precision cosmology in the era of GW astronomy.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Before its time: a remarkably evolved protocluster core at z=7.88</strong>, Callum Witten et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06284v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06284v1</a></p>

<p>Protoclusters represent the most extreme environments in the very early Universe. They form from large-scale dark matter overdensities, harbouring an overabundance of galaxies fed by large gas reservoirs. Their early and accelerated evolution results in a distinct difference in the properties of galaxies resident in protoclusters versus the field, which is known to be in place by $z\sim 5-6$. We utilise JWST NIRCam observations of the A2744-z7p9OD protocluster at $z=7.88$ to constrain the properties of resident galaxies. We identify seven new protocluster members, bringing the total number to 23 and the total stellar mass of the protocluster to in excess of $10^{10}\ \rm{M_{\odot}}$. These galaxies are remarkably evolved just 650 Myr after the Big Bang, preferentially showing redder UV-slopes and stronger Balmer breaks than is typical of field galaxies. We use the PROSPECTOR spectral energy distribution fitting code to derive key galaxy properties, finding distinct populations in the core versus the outskirts of the protocluster. The core is largely composed of dusty, massive galaxies which can be characterised as undergoing a synchronised (mini)-quenched phase, while galaxies in the protocluster outskirts are undergoing recent bursts of star formation. Finally, a strong suppression of the continuum around the Ly$\alpha$-break evidences extreme neutral hydrogen column densities in many resident galaxies ($N_{\rm HI}\gtrsim10^{23}\ {\rm cm^{-2}}$). The A2744-z7p9OD system is the most extreme, evolved overdensity yet observed at $z&gt;7$, with higher stellar masses, gas densities, and dust attenuation, revealing the intersection of local environment and high-redshift galaxy formation at their extremes.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Investigating the imprint of quintessence in cosmic magnification</strong>, Didam Duniya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06200v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06200v1</a></p>

<p>We study cosmic magnification beyond lensing in a late-time universe dominated by quintessence and cold dark matter. The cosmic magnification angular power spectrum, especially going beyond the well-known lensing effect, provides an independent avenue for investigating the properties of quintessence, and hence, dark energy. By analysing the magnification power spectrum at different redshifts, it is possible to extract new information about the large-scale imprint of dark energy, including whether we are able to disentangle different models from one another. Using three well-known quintessence models, we analyse the cosmic magnification angular power spectrum while taking relativistic corrections into account. We found that it will be difficult to distinguish between quintessence models, and quintessence from the cosmological constant, in lensing magnification angular power spectrum on large scales, at redshifts $z \,{\leq}\, 1$; whereas, when relativistic corrections are incorporated, the total magnification angular power spectrum holds the potential to distinguish between the models, at the given $z$. At $z \,{\geq}\, 3$, the lensing magnification angular power spectrum can be a reasonable approximation of the total magnification angular power spectrum. We also found that both the total relativistic and the Doppler magnification signals, respectively, surpass cosmic variance at $z \,{\leq}\, 0.5$: hence the effect may be detectable at the given $z$. On the other hand, the ISW and the time-delay magnification signals, respectively, are surpassed by cosmic variance on all scales, at epochs up to $z \,{=}\, 4.5$, with the gravitational-potential magnification signal being zero.</p>

<p>The merger of binary pulsars in dark matter (DM)-rich environments can result in DM particle accretion, leading to an increase in the individual pulsar masses. In this work, we investigate the effects of DM accretion on the change in orbital period rate of binary pulsars. Our analysis reveals that while DM accretion increases the systemâs mass, it may also modify the orbital evolution by enhancing the orbital decay rate. By comparing our results with existing binary pulsar data near Earthâs location, we report that the current DM accretion rate is insufficient to place meaningful constraints on DM particle properties. However, we demonstrate that future observations of pulsar mergers in the high DM-density environment of the galactic center could offer a unique opportunity to probe DM microphysics through this mechanism.</p>

<p>In the light of new full-sky surveys, many attempts of creating a consistent Galactic model were made. The main interest is to estimate the still poorly understood dark matter content. However, the results vary depending on methodology, assumptions, and baryonic distribution used. To understand this discrepancy, we take the first step by estimating the model-free local mass density of stars and stellar remnants. We use a complete sample from the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars within 100 pc from the Sun, together with the data on the sample of the White Dwarfs and the recent estimate of the Neutron Stars concentration in the solar neighborhood. After correction for unresolved binary stars and accounting for missing low-mass stars, we find the local mass density of stars and stellar remnants in the solar neighborhood is $\rho_{100} = 0.040^{+0.012} _{ -0.006}M_\odot pc^{-3}$ with Kroupa IMF, and $\rho_{100} = 0.037^{+0.012}_{ -0.006}M_\odot pc^{-3}$ with Chabrier IMF.</p>

<p>We study scalar singlet extensions of the Standard Model (SM), focusing on scenarios where dark matter (DM) is stabilized by a (\mathbb{Z}_2) symmetry. In the minimal single-scalar extension of the SM, only a narrow region near the Higgs resonance remains viable, requiring small portal couplings in order to simultaneously satisfy the observed relic abundance and comply with the most recent direct detection limits from the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ-2024) and XENON1T experiments. To address this limitation, we extend the dark sector by introducing additional real singlet scalars. In both two- and three-singlet extensions, we demonstrate that the observed dark matter relic density can be accommodated with larger Higgs portal couplings. These couplings significantly impact early-Universe dynamics by enhancing the strength of the electroweak phase transition. Both the two- and three-singlet scalar extensions can induce a strong first-order electroweak phase transition, generating stochastic gravitational waves potentially observable at future space-based detectors such as LISA and DECIGO. Notably, the three-singlet scenario induce an even stronger transition compared to the two-singlet case, enhancing the gravitational wave signal strength. Our results highlight the potential of extended scalar sectors as testable frameworks connecting dark matter and gravitational wave signals.</p>

<p>We present the analysis of the stellar populations and kinematics of the globular cluster (GC) rich ultra-diffuse galaxy, PUDG-R21, using spectroscopic observations obtained with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). The recessional velocity is measured to be 5536$\pm$10 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$, confirming its association with the Perseus cluster. The galaxy exhibits mild rotation of 15.6$\pm$10 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$ and a stellar velocity dispersion of 19.4$\pm$3.5 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$ within the galaxy effective radius. From this, we infer a dynamical mass of M$_{\mathrm{dyn}}=9.3\pm3.3\times10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. Based on a halo mass derived from PUDG-R21 GC counts, we find our dynamical mass is consistent with a cored dark matter profile. The integrated stellar population analysis reveals a predominantly old stellar population of 10.4$\pm$1.2 Gyr, with intermediate-low metallicity ([M/H]=-0.64$\pm$0.12 dex) and elevated alpha abundances ([Mg/Fe]=0.38$\pm$0.25 dex). The inferred star formation history suggests rapid stellar assembly, likely truncating prior to or during the galaxyâs infall into the cluster at an early epoch ($\sim$10 Gyr ago). The analysis of stellar population gradients (age and metallicity) indicates a flat profile out to one effective radius. Here, we consider the involvement of two star formation events, initially forming a large population of metal-poor globular clusters, and then the latter contributing to the more metal-enriched diffuse stellar body. The evidence of subsequent star formation suggests this galaxy is more like an extension of the classical dwarf population than the much discussed failed galaxy UDGs.</p>

<p>Supernova remnants (SNRs) have long been suspected to be the primary sources of Galactic cosmic rays. Over the past decades, great strides have been made in the modelling of particle acceleration, magnetic field amplification, and escape from SNRs. Yet while many SNRs have been observed in nonthermal emission in radio, X-rays, and gamma rays, there is no evidence for any individual object contributing to the locally observed flux. Here, we propose a particular spectral signature from individual remnants that is due to the energy-dependent escape from SNRs. For young and nearby sources, we predict fluxes enhanced by tens of percent in narrow rigidity intervals; given the percent-level flux uncertainties of contemporary cosmic-ray data, such features should be readily detectable. We model the spatial and temporal distribution of sources and the resulting distribution of fluxes with a Monte Carlo approach. The decision tree that we have trained on simulated data is able to discriminate with very high significance between the null hypothesis of a smooth distribution of sources and the scenario with a stochastic distribution of individual sources. We suggest that this cosmic-ray energy-dependent injection time (CREDIT) scenario be considered in experimental searches to identify individual SNRs as cosmic-ray sources.</p>

<p>This study employs well-localized fast radio bursts (FRBs) to constrain cosmological parameters using two model-independent methods: the reconstruction of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ with an artificial neural network and cosmography. By integrating FRB data with type Ia supernovae (SNe), BAO from DESI DR2, and cosmic chronometers (CC), we derive constraints on the Hubble constant ($H_0$), deceleration parameter ($q_0$), and jerk parameter ($j_0$). For the reconstruction method, our MCMC analysis with FRB-only provides $H_0 = 69.9 \pm 5.8 \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, corresponding to a precision of $\sim 8\%$. A joint analysis with FRB+SNe+DESI gives $H_0 = 68.85_{-0.48}^{+0.47} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, reaching a precision below 1\%. The cosmographic approach with FRBs alone provides $H_0 = 65.83_{-4.87}^{+3.77} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.45_{-0.31}^{+0.26}$, and $j_0 = 1.17_{-0.58}^{+0.70}$ with a precision for the Hubble constant of $\sim 6\%$. Besides, the DESI DR2 dataset yields $H_0 = 65.20_{-1.28}^{+1.29} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.29\pm 0.07$, and $j_0 = 0.58_{-0.04}^{+0.03}$, indicating an accuracy of $\sim 2\%$ for the Hubble constant. Combining the FRB, SNe, DESI, and CC datasets provide tighter constraints, e.g., $H_0 = 67.88_{-0.53}^{+0.52} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.42_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$, and $j_0 = 0.56 \pm 0.02$. Notably, these findings provide a statistically significant indication of deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM prediction of $j_0 = 1$, suggesting possible departures from standard cosmology at a $1\sigma$ confidence level. They also confirm a model-independent accelerated expansion ($q_0 &lt; 0$), demonstrating the potential of FRBs as valuable cosmological probes.</p>

<p>Observing the stars in our night sky tells us that giant, supergiant and hypergiant stars hold an unique importance in the understanding of stellar populations. Theoretical stellar models predict a rich tapestry of evolved stars. These evolved stars result in supernova explosions for massive stars and the shedding of the outer layers of low- and intermediate-mass stars to form white dwarf stars. Stars on these pathways provide elemental and kinematic feedback that shapes their host galaxies and synthesize the elements that we observe in the Universe today. Observational surveys in the Milky Way and the Local Group of galaxies shape our physical understanding of stellar evolution. Hypergiant stars represent stellar evolution at the extremes, displaying evidence of intense stellar winds combined with luminosities and radii that are unrivalled. Supergiant stars are used as elemental beacons in distant galaxies, and supergiants that cross the Cepheid variable instability strip can be used as rulers to measure the scale of our Universe. The overwhelming majority of stars in the Milky Way will become giant stars. Giants are hundreds of times larger and thousands of times more luminous than the Sun, which makes them excellent tracers of stellar structure. In this chapter, I describe the observational and theoretical manifestations of stellar evolution at various stages and masses. I highlight evolutionary connections between evolved products and comment on their eventual endpoints.</p>

<p>Context. Deriving the mass and large-scale asymmetries of radioactive isotopes offers valuable insights into the complex phases of a supernova explosion. Important examples are $^{56}$Ni, with its decay products $^{56}$Co and $^{56}$Fe, and $^{44}$Ti, which are studied through their X-rays emission lines and provide a powerful diagnostic tool to probe the explosive nucleosynthesis processes in the inner layers of the exploding star. Aims. In this framework, SN 1987A provides a privileged laboratory being the youngest supernova remnant from which the mass of Ti has been estimated. However, some tension exists in determining the initial mass of $^{44}$Ti. Previous analysis, relying on \textit{NuSTAR} and \textit{INTEGRAL} data, report $M_{44} = (1.5 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-4}$ $M_\odot$ and $M_{44}=(3.1 \pm 0.8) \times 10^{-4} M_\odot$, respectively. In this paper we estimate the initial mass of $^{44}$Ti via its decay product, the $^{44}$Sc emission line at 4.09 keV, using \textit{Chandra} observations. Methods. We perform multi-epoch spectral analysis focusing on the inner part of the remnant, to minimize the contamination from the X-ray emission stemming from the shocked plasma. As a result, we provide the detection of $^{44}$Sc emission line in the central part of SN 1987A with a $\sim$99.7\% (3 $\sigma$) significance. Results. The simultaneous fit of the spectra extracted from observations between 2016 and 2021 provides a line flux of $6.8^{+2.2}_{-2.3}\times 10^{-7}$ photons s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ corresponding to a $^{44}$Ti mass $M_{44}=(1.6\pm0.5) \times 10^{-4} M_\odot$ (errors at the $90\%$ confidence level). The results obtained with our spectral analysis seem to align with those derived with NuSTAR.</p>

<p>Observations of our Galaxy at very-high and ultra-high photon energies have revealed a rich population of sources, many of which have significant angular extension and/or are positionally coincident with energetic pulsars. We assessed whether the properties of these gamma-ray emitters are consistent with the predictions of a model for the non-thermal leptonic emission of a pulsar wind nebula expanding within a supernova remnant, including the possibility of particle escape across the different components of the system up to the ambient medium. We used a multi-zone model framework that describes the transport and radiation of a population of ultra-relativistic electron-positron pairs. The dynamics of the system is retrieved from numerical hydrodynamics simulations, which allows to follow the evolution through advanced stages. Model predictions for typical parameter setups are compared to source catalogs issued by the H.E.S.S. and LHAASO collaborations. If particles remain confined in the nebula, 1-100TeV emission is only partially consistent with the properties of observed sources in terms of surface brightness, angular extent, and photon index. In particular, the systems spend a long time in a bright and soft state that has no equivalent in observations. Conversely, including the possibility of energy-dependent particle escape across the object results in a much better agreement, both in the 1-10TeV range explored with H.E.S.S. or LHAASO-WCDA, and in the 20-100TeV range explored by LHAASO-KM2A. Emission components with intermediate to low brightnesses and large to very large sizes result from particles trapped in the remnant or escaped in the surrounding medium. Particle escape, clearly seen in the form of misaligned jets or halos around middle-aged pulsars, is a very important process in much younger systems with 1-100kyr ages, and shapes their appearance as TeV/PeV sources.</p>

<p>Thermonuclear supernovae (SNe) are the result of the nuclear transformation of carbon/oxygen (C/O) white dwarfs (WDs) to the radioactive element $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and intermediate mass elements (IMEs) like Ca, Ar, etc. Most progenitor scenarios involve a companion star which donates matter to the exploding white dwarf, implying a fundamental prediction: the formation of a wake in the explosive ejecta as it runs into and moves past the companion star. This wake leaves an indelible imprint on the ejectaâs density, velocity, and composition structure that remains fixed as the ejecta reaches homologous expansion. We simulate the interaction of the ejecta and Roche-lobe filling donor in a double degenerate double detonation Type Ia progenitor scenario and explore the detectability of this imprint in late-time nebular phase spectroscopy of Type Ia SNe under the assumption of local heating ($t &gt; 200$ days). At these times, the velocity profiles of forbidden emission lines reflect the velocity distribution of all of the ejecta and the critical electron density for that forbidden line. We explicitly calculate line shapes for the [Co III] $11.89 \mu\mathrm{m}$ line that traces the initial $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ distribution and the [Ar III] $8.99 \mu\mathrm{m}$ line, which traces a typical intermediate mass element. We predict the viewing angle dependence of the line shape, present a tool to quickly calculate optically thin line shapes for various 3D density-velocity profiles and discuss JWST observations.</p>

<p>As most massive stars are born in binary and other multiple-star systems, many are expected to exchange mass with a companion star or merge with it during their lives. This means that most supernovae (SNe) are from such binary products. Here, we focus on hydrogen-rich Type II SNe from accretors of binary mass transfer and stellar mergers. We compute various SN properties such as the explosion energies, nickel yields, and neutron star (NS) kick velocities, but also consider NS masses. We find tight correlations between these parameters and, e.g., the central specific entropy and core compactness. However, there is no obvious relation between these explosion properties and the evolutionary history of the pre-SN stars. We find linear relations between the nickel mass and the SN explosion energy and the NS remnant mass. We further group our models into progenitors of SNe IIP, SN 1987A-like and interacting SNe, predict their SN and SN-progenitor properties and compare to observations. Accretors of binary mass transfer and stellar mergers naturally produce SNe IIP with long plateau durations from progenitors with relatively small CO-cores but large envelope masses (c.f. SN 2015ba). Our models give rise to tight relations between the plateau luminosity and the nickel mass as well as the SN ejecta velocity as inferred observationally for SNe IIP. We speculate that cool/red supergiants at $\log\,L/L_\odot\,{\geq}\,5.5$ encounter enhanced mass loss due to envelope instabilities and could then explode in interacting SNe IIn. The rate of such SNe from our models seems compatible with observations. Some of our binary models explode as $10^6\,L_\odot$ blue supergiants that may have encountered enhanced and/or eruptive mass loss shortly before their SNe and could thus help understand interacting SNe such as SN 1961V and SN 2005gl but also superluminous Type II SNe such as SN 2010jl.

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Introducing NewCluster: the first half of the history of a high-resolution cluster simulation</strong>, San Han et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06301v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.06301v1</a></p>

<p>We introduce NewCluster, a new high-resolution cluster simulation designed to serve as the massive halo counterpart of the modern cosmological galaxy evolution framework. The zoom-in simulation targets a volume of $4.1\sigma$ overdensity region, which is expected to evolve into a galaxy cluster with a virial mass of $5 \times 10^{14} M_\odot$, comparable to that of the Virgo Cluster. The zoom-in volume extends out to 3.5 virial radii from the central halo. The novelties of NewCluster are found in its resolutions. Its stellar mass resolution of $2 \times 10^{4} M_\odot$ is effective for tracing the early assembly of massive galaxies as well as the formation of dwarf galaxies. The spatial resolution of 68 parsecs in the best-resolved regions in the adaptive-mesh-refinement approach is powerful to study the detailed kinematic structure of galaxies. The time interval between snapshots is also exceptionally short-15 Myr-which is ideal for monitoring changes in the physical properties of galaxies, particularly during their orbital motion within a larger halo. The simulation has up-to-date feedback schemes for supernovae and active galactic nuclei. The chemical evolution is calculated for ten elements, along with dust calculation that includes the formation, size change, and destruction. To overcome the limitations of the Eulerian approach used for gas dynamics in this study, we employ Monte Carlo-based tracer particles in NewCluster, enabling a wide range of scientific investigations.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>An optical to infrared study of type II SN2024ggi at nebular times</strong>, Luc Dessart et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05803v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05803v1</a></p>

<p>We present 0.3-21mic observations at ~275d and ~400d for Type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi, combining ground-based optical and near-infrared data from the Keck I/II telescopes and space-based infrared data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Although the optical regions dominate the observed flux, SN2024ggi is bright at infrared wavelengths (65%/35% falls each side of 1mic). SN2024ggi exhibits a plethora of emission lines from H, He, intermediate-mass elements (O, Na, Mg, S, Ar, Ca), and iron-group elements (IGEs; Fe, Co, and Ni) â all lines have essentially the same width, suggesting efficient macroscopic chemical mixing of the inner ejecta at &lt;~2000km/s and little mixing of 56Ni at larger velocities. Molecular emission in the infrared range is dominated by the CO fundamental, which radiates about 5% of the total SN luminosity. A molecule-free radiative-transfer model based on a standard red-supergiant star explosion (i.e., ~1e51erg, 0.06Msun of 56Ni from a 15.2Msun progenitor) yields a satisfactory match throughout the optical and infrared at both epochs. The SN2024ggi CO luminosity is comparable to the fractional decay-power absorbed in the model C/O-rich shell â accounting for CO cooling would likely resolve the model overestimate of the [OI]0.632mic flux. The relative weakness of the molecular emission in SN2024ggi and the good overall match obtained with our molecule-free model suggests negligible microscopic mixing â about 95% of the SN luminosity is radiated by atoms and ions. Lines from IGEs, which form from explosion ashes at such late times, are ideal diagnostics of the magnitude of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SN ejecta. Stable Ni, clearly identified in SN2024ggi (e.g., [NiII]6.634mic), is probably a common product of massive-star explosions.</p>

<p>2025-07-08, <strong>Pulsar Rockets and Gaia Neutron Star Binaries</strong>, Vishal Baibhav et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05602v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05602v1</a></p>

<p>We prove that the spin-aligned electromagnetic recoil force acting on a pulsar vanishes identically in Force-Free Electrodynamics. This contrasts with Hirai et al.âs recent argument that the rocket effect was important for explaining the eccentricity distribution of wide neutron star binaries found by Gaia. Our detailed analysis confirms that for a broad range of initial conditions and natal kick distributions, the rocket velocities of $v_r \gtrsim 30\, \mathrm{km/s}$ are required to account for the observed eccentricities. However, we find that in scenarios where the common envelope phase does not significantly shrink the initial orbit, and the natal kicks are drawn from Paczynski-type distribution, these eccentricities may arise without the influence of an EM rocket. If the natal kicks are perpendicular to the initial orbits, then explaining the Gaia neutron star eccentricities without invoking rockets additionally requires that the pre-supernova binaries avoid significant circularization, and that the mass loss during the supernova is minimal.   The rocket effect can only be substantial in âweakâ pulsars, where pair production near the light cylinder is suppressed and ${\bf E}\cdot{\bf B} \neq 0$ in the outer magnetosphere. We derive a rough estimate for a rocket force in a weak pulsar and relate it to the pulsarâs radiative efficiency; simulations are needed to obtain numerically reliable expressions. If future observations prove that rockets are required to explain the data, this would imply that Gaia neutron stars are $\gtrsim $ Myr old, were previously rapidly spinning and are weakly magnetized, with a dipole field $\lesssim 10^{10}$ G and a relatively strong quadrupole component.</p>
