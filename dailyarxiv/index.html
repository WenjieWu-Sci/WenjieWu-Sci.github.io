<p>To search for $\beta\beta0\nu$ decay with unprecedented sensitivity, the R2D2 collaboration is developing a radial time projection chamber with a fiducial mass of half a ton of 136Xe at high pressure. The various approaches implemented to eliminate the radioactive background are presented in terms of detector design, topological recognition of interactions, and event energy reconstruction. The developed tools allow for the disentangling of the sought-after signal from the background, and the projected sensitivity after ten years of data taking yields a half-life limit exceeding $10^{27}$ years, along with a constraint on the effective neutrino mass $m_{\beta\beta}$, sufficient to exclude the inverted mass hierarchy region.</p>

<p>Cosmology is entering a very exciting time in its history, when a wealth of cutting-edge experiments are all starting to collect data, or about to. These experiments aim at addressing some of the most intriguing questions in fundamental physics, such as what is the nature of dark matter, is dark energy a cosmological constant or a varying field, what are the masses of the neutrinos, and more. While Lambda-CDM has emerged as a simple model that is consistent with most of the current data sets, we are starting to see some interesting deviations that deserve further exploration. This contribution provides an overview of upcoming projects and the science opportunities they will allow. In particular, we recall and comment the DESI year-1 BAO constraints and their implications for dark energy. We put some of the most recent results and outstanding questions in the perspective of the forthcoming observational program.</p>

<p>2024-11-06, <strong>Distinguishing Coupled Dark Energy Models with Neural Networks</strong>, L. W. K. Goh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04058v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.04058v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate whether Neural Networks (NN) can accurately differentiate between growth-rate data of the Large Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe, simulated via two models: a cosmological constant and cold dark matter ({\Lambda}CDM) model and a tomographic Coupled Dark Energy (CDE) model. We build an NN classifier and test its accuracy in distinguishing between cosmological models. For our dataset, we generate f{\sigma_8}(z) growth-rate observables simulating a realistic Stage IV galaxy survey-like setup, for both {\Lambda}CDM and a tomographic CDE model, for various values of the model parameters. We then optimise and train our NN with Optuna, aiming to avoid overfitting and maximising the accuracy of the trained model. We conduct our analysis for both a binary classification, comparing between {\Lambda}CDM and a CDE model where only one tomographic coupling bin is activated, and a multiclass classification scenario where all the models are combined. For the case of binary classification, we find that our NN can confidently (with &gt; 86% accuracy) detect non-zero values of the tomographic coupling regardless of the redshift range at which coupling is activated, and at a 100% confidence level, detect the {\Lambda}CDM model. For the multiclass classification task, we find that the NN performs adequately well at distinguishing between {\Lambda}CDM, a CDE model with low redshift coupling, and a model with high redshift coupling, with 99%, 79% and 84% accuracy respectively. By leveraging the power of machine learning, our pipeline can be a useful tool to analyse growth-rate data and maximise the potential of current surveys to probe for deviations from General Relativity.</p>

<p>2024-11-06, <strong>Rotation curves of disk galaxies and General Relativity</strong>, Luca Ciotti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03987v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.03987v1</a></p>

<p>It has been proposed that the flat rotation curves observed at large radii in disk galaxies can be interpreted as an effect of General Relativity (GR) instead of the presence of dark matter (DM) halos in Newtonian gravity. In Ciotti (2022) the problem is rigorously explored in the special setting of the weak-field, low-velocity gravitomagnetic limit of GR. The rotation curves are obtained for purely baryonic disk models with realistic density profiles, and compared with the predictions of Newtonian gravity for the same disks, in absence of DM. The rotation curves are indistinguishable, with percentual GR corrections at all radii of the order of $\approx 10^{-6}$ or less, so that DM halos are required in gravitomagnetism as in Newtonian gravity. From a more general point of view, a list of the most urgent problems that must be addressed by any proposed GR-based alternative to the existence of DM, is given.</p>

<p>2024-11-06, <strong>Model-independent calibration of Gamma-Ray Bursts with neural networks</strong>, Purba Mukherjee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03773v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.03773v1</a></p>

<p>The $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model has been highly successful in predicting cosmic structure and evolution, yet recent precision measurements have highlighted discrepancies, especially in the Hubble constant inferred from local and early-Universe data. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) present a promising alternative for cosmological measurements, capable of reaching higher redshifts than traditional distance indicators. This work leverages GRBs to refine cosmological parameters independently of the $\Lambda$CDM framework. Using the Platinum compilation of long GRBs, we calibrate the Dainotti relations-empirical correlations among GRB luminosity properties-as standard candles through artificial neural networks (ANNs). We analyze both the 2D and 3D Dainotti calibration relations, leveraging an ANN-driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to minimize scatter in the calibration parameters, thereby achieving a stable Hubble diagram. This ANN-based calibration approach offers advantages over Gaussian processes, avoiding issues such as kernel function dependence and overfitting. Our results emphasize the need for model-independent calibration approaches to address systematic challenges in GRB luminosity variability, ultimately extending the cosmic distance ladder in a robust way. By addressing redshift evolution and reducing systematic uncertainties, GRBs can serve as reliable high-redshift distance indicators, offering critical insights into current cosmological tensions.</p>

<p>2024-11-06, <strong>Renormalization group improved cosmology in the presence of a stiff matter era</strong>, Gopinath Guin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03693v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.03693v1</a></p>

<p>In \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.92.103004}{Phys. Rev. D 92 (2015) 103004}, simple analytical solutions of the Friedman equations were obtained for a universe having stiff matter component in the early universe together with a dark matter, and a dark energy component. In this analysis, the universe is considered to be made of a dark fluid which behaves as a stiff matter in the early phase of the universe (when the internal energy dominates). It is also more logical to consider quantum gravitational effects in the early phase of the cosmological evolution. In this analysis, following \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.65.043508}{Phys. Rev. D 65 (2002) 043508}, we consider renormalization group improved modified Friedmann equations where the Newtonâs gravitational constant ($G$) and the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) flows with the momentum scale $k$ of the universe. It is observed that for a universe undergoing a stiff matter era, radiation era, and matter era, inflation is absent in the early time regime of the universe when the flow of the Newtonâs gravitational constant and cosmological constant is under consideration. Using the identification of the momentum scale with the scale factor of the universe, we then explore the era $t&gt;t_{\text{Pl}}$ which indicates a primarily matter dominated era with accelerated expansion due to the presence of dark energy. Finally, considering the total equation of state as a combination of linear equation of state along with a polytropic equation of state, we observe that after the Planck-time the universe can undergo an inflationary phase and we find out that the inflation is enhanced by quantum gravitational effects arising due to the consideration of renormalization group approach to quantum gravity.</p>

<h1 id="supernova-1">supernova (1)</h1>

<p>2024-11-06, <strong>Looking into the world of interacting supernovae</strong>, Anjasha Gangopadhyay et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04107v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.04107v1</a></p>

<p>Interacting supernovae provide key insights into the mass-loss processes of massive stars and their circumstellar environments. By analyzing their photometric and spectroscopic properties, we can study the complex interactions between ejected material and circumstellar material (CSM). This paper highlights the diversity of interacting SNe, including Types IIn, Ibn, and Icn, and explores the challenges in understanding progenitor systems, CSM structures, and late-time evolution. Advances in high-cadence observations and modeling are crucial for improving our knowledge of these stellar explosions.</p>
