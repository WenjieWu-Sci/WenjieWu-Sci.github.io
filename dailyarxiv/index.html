<p>2025-02-05, <strong>The cosmic optical background intensity from decaying sterile neutrinos via magnetic dipole moment</strong>, Hriditi Howlader et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03328v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.03328v1</a></p>

<p>NASA’s New Horizon observations yielded the most accurate measurement of the cosmic optical background (COB) intensity. The reported COB flux is $16.37\pm 1.47$ $\mathrm{nW/m^2/sr}$ at a pivot wavelength $ \lambda_{piv} = 0.608~ \mu\mathrm{m}$ observed in the range $( 0.4 ~ \mu\mathrm{m} \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 0.9 \, \mu\mathrm{m})$. After subtracting the measured intensity from the deep Hubble space telescope count, an anomalous excess flux $8.06 \pm 1.92~\mathrm{nW/m^2/sr}$ has been found. This observation could hint toward decaying dark matter producing photons. In this work, we have considered sterile neutrinos of the keV scale as well as the eV scale decaying via sterile-to-sterile transition magnetic dipole moment and active-to-sterile transition magnetic dipole moment, respectively, to explain anomalous flux. The sterile neutrinos with a mass of $\mathcal{O}(\rm keV)$ with transition magnetic moment in the range $3\times 10^{-14}\,\mu_{B} - 10^{-13}\,\mu_{B}$, and mass of $\mathcal{O}(\rm eV)$ with transition magnetic moment in the range $3.33\times 10^{-13}\,\mu_{B} - 10^{-12}\,\mu_{B}$ can successfully account for the observed anomalous intensity.</p>

<p>2025-02-05, <strong>Exploring Hubble Tension Alleviation through Neutrino-Coupled Perturbed $f(R)$ Gravity</strong>, Muhammad Yarahmadi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03190v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.03190v1</a></p>

<p>This work examines the Hubble constant ((H_0)) tension within the frameworks of perturbed (f(R)) gravity and perturbed (f(R)) gravity coupled with neutrinos, using lastest observational data. The datasets incorporate the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), lensing, and Pantheon supernovae. We compare the ability of these models to bridge the discrepancy between Planck 2018 ((H_0 = 67.4 \pm 0.5 \ \text{km/s/Mpc})) and the local R22 measurement ((H_0 = 73.5 \pm 1.04 \ \text{km/s/Mpc})). In perturbed (f(R)) gravity, the derived (H_0) values align closely with Planck, leaving a substantial tension with R22. The inclusion of neutrino interactions introduces additional parameters that shift (H_0) toward higher values, reducing the tension with local measurements. Notably, the coupled model achieves a smaller residual tension compared to the standalone perturbed (f(R)) model, indicating that neutrino physics plays a significant role in modifying the late-time expansion dynamics. While both models provide insights into addressing the Hubble tension, the coupled (f(R)) gravity with neutrinos offers a more consistent alignment across the datasets.</p>

<p>2025-02-05, <strong>Exploration of optimized front-end readout circuit for time measurement of large-area SiPM arrays</strong>, M. X. Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02999v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.02999v1</a></p>

<p>The detector of TRopIcal DEep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT) will use large-area silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays combined with photomultiplier tubes to boost photon detection efficiency and pointing capability. An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is being developed to aim at high-resolution time measurement of large-area SiPM arrays. This work researches four architectures of readout circuits including different input stages (common gate stage and negative feedback common gate stage) and discriminators (two types of current discriminator and one voltage discriminator) using a 180 nm CMOS process for optimizing time resolution. The experimental measurements show that single photon time resolutions performed using Hamamatsu S13360-3050PE SiPMs are around 260 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM). A timing jitter less than 500 ps FWHM when connecting a 6x6 mm^2 SiPM array is achieved. The power consumption is less than 7 mW/channel. Additionally, a digital summation is applied to reduce the number of output interfaces. The measured performances of the ASIC cater to the TRIDENT application requirements.</p>

<p>2025-02-05, <strong>Interacting dark energy constraints from the full-shape analyses of BOSS DR12 and DES Year 3 measurements</strong>, M. Tsedrik et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03390v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.03390v1</a></p>

<p>Dark Scattering (DS) is an interacting dark energy model characterised by pure momentum exchange between dark energy and dark matter. It is phenomenologically interesting because it is unconstrained by CMB data and can alleviate the $S_8$ tension. We derive constraints on cosmological and DS parameters using three two-point correlation functions (3$\times$2pt) from the Dark Energy Survey third year data release (DES Y3). We then add information from the multipoles of the galaxy power spectrum combined with Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements using the twelfth data release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR12) and external BAO measurements. We compare results from the direct combination of the probes with the joint posterior distribution calculated with a normalising flow approach. Additionally, we run a CMB analysis with the Planck Public Release 4 (PR4) for comparison of the cosmological constraints. Overall, we find that the combination of probes allows minimising the projection effects and improves constraints without the need to include CMB information. It brings the marginalised posterior maxima closer to the corresponding best-fit values and weakens the sensitivity to the priors of the spectroscopic modelling nuisance parameters. These findings are highly relevant in light of forthcoming data of surveys like DESI, Euclid, and Rubin.</p>

<p>2025-02-05, <strong>Constraints on Ultra-light Axion Dark Matter through Galaxy Cluster Number Counts</strong>, S. Zelmer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03353v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.03353v1</a></p>

<p>Ultra-light axions are hypothetical scalar particles that influence the evolution of large-scale structures of the Universe. Depending on their mass, they can potentially be part of the dark matter component of the Universe, as candidates commonly referred to as fuzzy dark matter. While strong constraints have been established for pure fuzzy dark matter models, the more general scenario where ultra-light axions constitute only a fraction of the dark matter has been limited to a few observational probes. In this work, we use the galaxy cluster number counts obtained from the first All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) of the SRG/eROSITA mission together with gravitational weak lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey, the Kilo-Degree Survey, and the Hyper Suprime-Cam, to constrain the fraction of ultra-light axions in the mass range $10^{-32}$ eV to $10^{-24}$ eV. We put upper bounds on the ultra-light axion relic density in independent logarithmic axion mass bins by performing a full cosmological parameter inference. We find an exclusion region in the intermediate ultra-light axion mass regime with the tightest bounds reported so far in the mass bins around $m_\mathrm{a}=10^{-27}$ eV with $\Omega_\mathrm{a} &lt; 0.0036$ and $m_\mathrm{a}=10^{-26}$ eV with $\Omega_\mathrm{a} &lt; 0.0084$, both at 95% confidence level. When combining with CMB probes, these bounds are tightened to $\Omega_\mathrm{a} &lt; 0.0030$ in the $m_\mathrm{a}=10^{27}$ eV mass bin and $\Omega_\mathrm{a} &lt; 0.0058$ in the $m_\mathrm{a}=10^{-26}$ eV mass bin, both at 95% confidence level. This is the first time that constraints on ultra-light axions have been obtained using the growth of structure measured by galaxy cluster number counts. These results pave the way for large surveys, which can be utilized to obtain tight constraints on the mass and relic density of ultra-light axions with better theoretical modeling of the abundance of halos.</p>

<p>2025-02-05, <strong>Test of electric charge conservation in dark matter direct detection experiment</strong>, Z. H. Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03258v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.03258v1</a></p>

<p>Electric charge conservation (ECC) is typically taken as an axiom in the standard model. Searching for small violations with high-performance experiments could lead us to new physics. In this work, we tested ``invisible” electric charge nonconservation (ECNC) events with 1.16 ton$\cdot$year electron recoil data from the XENON-nT experiment. There was no statistically significant signal, and the ECNC limit was updated to $\tau(e^-\rightarrow{\nu_e+\bar{\nu}_e+\nu_e}) &gt; 4.34 \times10^{27}$ yr. This work increases the limit by two orders of magnitude and shows that dark matter direct detection experiments have great potential for further ECC testing.</p>

<p>2025-02-05, <strong>Phase space analysis of CCDM cosmologies</strong>, Sudip Halder et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03256v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.03256v1</a></p>

<p>We perform a detailed investigation of the CCDM (creation of cold dark matter) cosmologies using the powerful techniques of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. Considering a wide variety of the creation rates ranging from constant to dynamical, we examine the nature of critical points and their stability obtained from the individual scenario consisting of only cold dark matter, or cold dark matter plus a second fluid with constant equation of state. According to our analyses, these scenarios predict unstable dark matter dominated critical points, stable accelerating attractors dominated either by dark matter or the second fluid, scaling attractors in which both dark matter and the second fluid co-exist. Along with these critical points, these scenarios also indicate the possibility of decelerating attractors or decelerating scaling attractors in the future which are new results in this direction. These altogether suggest that CCDM cosmologies are viable alternatives to the mainstream cosmological models.</p>

<p>2025-02-05, <strong>Topological Sum Rules and Spectral Flows of Chiral and Gravitational Axion-like Interactions</strong>, Claudio Corianò et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03182v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.03182v1</a></p>

<p>We examine the structure of off-shell effective actions arising from chiral and gravitational anomalies, focusing on the $JJJ_A$ (axial-vector/vector/vector) and $J_A TT $ (axial-vector/stress-energy tensors) correlators, relevant in the analysis of anomaly-driven interactions in perturbation theory. Our approach relies on conformal field theory in momentum space, extended to chiral anomalies. The analysis centers on the presence of both particle poles and anomaly poles within these interactions, characterizing their behavior both in the conformal and non conformal limits. Through explicit computations, we show that universal sum rules in the longitudinal sector regulate these interactions for all kinematic conditions, extending previous analysis, and we discuss the resulting spectral flow, an area law of the absorptive part of the anomaly form factors as one moves away from or returns to the conformal point. These features are absent in the local effective action of anomaly interactions, commonly used in the description of axion-like particles. The spectral densities in both cases are shown to be self-similar. Our results further show that anomaly poles correspond to true particle poles only in the conformal limit, when the interaction describes a massless S-matrix process supported on a null-surface. Under these conditions, they can be effectively described by two kinetically mixed pseudoscalar fields propagating on the light-cone. These studies find application in polarized deeply inelastic scattering, axion-like dark matter and analogue systems such as topological materials.</p>

<p>2025-02-05, <strong>Fast Sampling of Cosmological Initial Conditions with Gaussian Neural Posterior Estimation</strong>, Oleg Savchenko et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03139v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.03139v1</a></p>

<p>Knowledge of the primordial matter density field from which the large-scale structure of the Universe emerged over cosmic time is of fundamental importance for cosmology. However, reconstructing these cosmological initial conditions from late-time observations is a notoriously difficult task, which requires advanced cosmological simulators and sophisticated statistical methods to explore a multi-million-dimensional parameter space. We show how simulation-based inference (SBI) can be used to tackle this problem and to obtain data-constrained realisations of the primordial dark matter density field in a simulation-efficient way with general non-differentiable simulators. Our method is applicable to full high-resolution dark matter $N$-body simulations and is based on modelling the posterior distribution of the constrained initial conditions to be Gaussian with a diagonal covariance matrix in Fourier space. As a result, we can generate thousands of posterior samples within seconds on a single GPU, orders of magnitude faster than existing methods, paving the way for sequential SBI for cosmological fields. Furthermore, we perform an analytical fit of the estimated dependence of the covariance on the wavenumber, effectively transforming any point-estimator of initial conditions into a fast sampler. We test the validity of our obtained samples by comparing them to the true values with summary statistics and performing a Bayesian consistency test.</p>

<p>2025-02-05, <strong>Gain compression in Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers</strong>, Gwenael Le Gal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03022v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.03022v1</a></p>

<p>Superconducting traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) are increasingly used in various applications, including quantum computing, quantum sensing, and dark matter detection. However, one important characteristic of these amplifiers, gain compression, has not received much attention. As a result, there is a lack of comprehensive experimental exploration of this phenomenon in the existing literature. In this study, we present an experimental investigation of gain compression in a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier based on a four-wave mixing process. We have implemented a novel setup to monitor the complex transmission of both the pump and signal tones, which allows us to simultaneously track pump depletion and signal amplification as functions of signal power and frequency across the entire bandwidth of the device. Our findings indicate that, while pump depletion occurs during gain compression, it is not the only mechanism involved in the saturation of a TWPA. Power-induced phase-matching processes also take place within the device. This study provides valuable insights for optimizing TWPAs for applications that require high total input power, such as multiplexed qubit readout or broadband photon emission.</p>

<p>2025-02-05, <strong>Electronic structure of liquid xenon in the context of light dark matter direct detection</strong>, Riccardo Catena et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02965v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.02965v1</a></p>

<p>We present a description of the electronic structure of xenon within the density-functional theory formalism with the goal of accurately modeling dark matter-induced ionisation in liquid xenon detectors. We compare the calculated electronic structures of the atomic, liquid and crystalline solid phases, and find that the electronic charge density and its derivatives in momentum space are similar in the atom and the liquid, consistent with the weak interatomic van der Waals bonding. The only notable difference is a band broadening of the highest occupied $5p$ levels, reflected in the densities of states of the condensed phases, as a result of the inter-atomic interactions. We therefore use the calculated density of states of the liquid phase, combined with the standard literature approach for the isolated atom, to recompute ionisation rates and exclusion limit curves for the XENON10 and XENON1T experiments. We find that the broadening of the 5$p$ levels induced by the liquid phase is relevant only at low dark matter masses, where it increases the ionisation rate relative to that of the isolated atom. For most of the probable mass range the energies of the discrete 4$d$ and 5$s$ levels have the strongest effect on the rate. Our findings suggest a simple scheme for calculating dark matter-electron scattering rates in liquid noble gas detectors, using the calculated values for the atom weighted by the density of states of the condensed phase.</p>

<p>2025-02-05, <strong>Search for fractionally charged particles as lightly ionizing particles using public data from an underground direct detection experiment</strong>, Z. H. Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02894v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.02894v1</a></p>

<p>Approximately 60 years after the Milligan oil drop experiment in 1909, fractionally charged particles (FCPs) were reported to have been discovered in air-shower cores, and the search for FCPs continues to the present day in space, terrestrial and underground experiments. In this letter, relativistic FCPs are examined as lightly ionizing particles in underground direct detection on the basis of electron recoil data from XENON-nT. For FCPs from supernova shocks, the best results are obtained via direct detection, excluding the FCP charge of $\left(3.6\times10^{-9} - 1.0\times10^{-2}\right)\cdot e$ corresponding to an FCP mass of 1 keV–556 GeV. For FCPs from general sources, the best limit is achieved, which is far ahead of other results in almost the entire parameter space, by excluding the FCP flux of $\left(4.0\times10^{-4} - 4.0\times10^{-16}\right)$ cm$^{-2}\cdot$ s$^{-1}\cdot$ sr$^{-1}$ corresponding to the FCP charge of $\left(1\times10^{-6} - 1\right)\cdot e$.</p>
