<p>2024-05-29, <strong>Two classes of Majorana neutrinos in the seesaw model</strong>, Kazuo Fujikawa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18702v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18702v1</a></p>

<p>The commonly used pseudo-C symmetry $(\nu_{L})^{c}=C\overline{\nu_{L}}^{T}$ is not defined in Lagrangian field theory. In general, there exist two classes of Majorana fermions; the first is associated with the chiral fermion with the conventional C and P symmetries, and the second is associated with the Weyl fermion defined by CP symmetry only and formally characterised by the pseudo-C symmetry. Taking the seesaw model as an example, it is shown that a generalized Pauli–G"{u}rsey (or Bogoliubov-type) canonical transformation converts the neutrino defined by the Weyl fermion to the neutrino defined by the chiral fermion and thus to the conventional Majorana fermion, while preserving the anti-commutation relations. The mixing angles in the weak lepton sector are not modified by this generalized Pauli–G"{u}rsey transformation.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>The DUNE-DAQ Application Framework</strong>, Eric L. Flumerfelt et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18583v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18583v1</a></p>

<p>The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a next-generation neutrino experiment that will probe the properties of these elusive particles with unparalleled precision. It will also act as an observatory for neutrino bursts caused by nearby supernovae, in the event that one occurs while the experiment is in operation. Given these goals, the DUNE trigger and DAQ system must be able to maintain extremely high uptime and provide a path for full readout of the detectors for very long times (up to 100~s). To achieve these ends, we have designed the DUNE DAQ system around a flexible “application framework”, which provides a modular interface for specific tasks while handling the interconnections between them. The application framework collects modules into applications which can then be interacted with as units by the control, configuration and monitoring systems. One of the key features of the framework is its communications abstraction layer, which allows for modules to interact with both internal queues and external network connections with a single transport-agnostic interface. We will report on the architecture and features of the framework.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Sensitivity to Kaon Decays to ALPs at Fixed Target Experiments</strong>, Joshua Berger et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18480v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18480v1</a></p>

<p>We study the sensitivity of fixed target experiments to hadronically-coupled axion like particles (ALPs) produced in kaon decays, with a particular emphasis on current and upcoming short-baseline neutrino experiments. We demonstrate that below the kaon decay mass threshold ($m_a &lt; m_K - m_\pi$) kaon decay is the dominant production mechanism for ALPs at neutrino experiments, larger by many orders of magnitude than production in psuedo-scalar mixing. Such axions can be probed principally by the di-photon and di-muon final states. In the latter case, even if the axion does not couple to muons at tree level, such a coupling is induced by the renormalization group flow from the UV scale. We reinterpret prior results by CHARM and MicroBooNE through these channels and show that they constrain new areas of heavy axion parameter space. We also show projections of the sensitivity of the SBN and DUNE experiments to axions through these channels, which reach up to multiple decades higher in the axion decay constant beyond existing constraints. DUNE projects to have a sensitivity competitive with other world-leading upcoming experiments.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Baryon number violation involving tauons</strong>, Julian Heeck et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18478v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18478v1</a></p>

<p>Baryon number violation is our most sensitive probe of physics beyond the Standard Model, especially through the study of nucleon decays. Angular momentum conservation requires a lepton in the final state of such decays, kinematically restricted to electrons, muons, or neutrinos. We show that operators involving tauons, which are at first sight too heavy to play a role in nucleon decays, still lead to clean nucleon decay channels with tau neutrinos. While many of them are already constrained from existing two-body searches such as $p\to \pi^+\nu$, other operators induce many-body decays such as $p \to \eta \pi^{+} \bar\nu_\tau$ and $n\to K^+ \pi^-\nu_\tau$ that have never been searched for.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Threshold Effects on the Massless Neutrino in the Canonical Seesaw Mechanism</strong>, Di Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18017v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18017v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we revisit the one-loop renormalization group equations (RGEs) among non-degenerate seesaw scales, i.e., threshold effects in the canonical seesaw mechanism, which have been obtained for more than two decades. We find some contributions from the Weinberg operator to its Wilson coefficient, the neutrino Yukawa coupling matrix, and the Higgs quartic coupling absent in the previous calculations. Based on the updated one-loop RGEs, we derive the RGE of the effective neutrino mass matrix’s determinant without any approximation. Then, for the first time, we provide a strict proof that the one-loop RG running effects among non-degenerate seesaw scales can not generate a non-zero mass for the initial massless neutrino in the minimal type-I seesaw mechanism or in the canonical one with a rank-degenerate neutrino Yukawa coupling matrix. One has to include two- or higher-loop corrections to achieve a non-zero mass for the massless neutrino.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Potential to Identify the Neutrino Mass Ordering with Reactor Antineutrinos in JUNO</strong>, The JUNO Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18008v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18008v1</a></p>

<p>The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a multi-purpose neutrino experiment under construction in South of China. This paper presents an updated estimate of JUNO’s sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering using the reactor antineutrinos emitted from eight nuclear reactor cores in the Taishan and Yangjiang nuclear power plants. This measurement is planned by studying the fine interference pattern caused by quasi-vacuum oscillations in the oscillated antineutrino spectrum at a baseline of 52.5~km and is completely independent of the CP violating phase and the neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{23}$. The sensitivity is obtained through a joint analysis of JUNO and TAO detectors utilizing the best available knowledge to date about the location and overburden of the JUNO experimental site, the local and global nuclear reactors, the JUNO and TAO detectors responses, the expected event rates and spectra of signal and backgrounds, and the systematic uncertainties of the analysis inputs. It is found that a 3$\sigma$ median sensitivity to reject the wrong mass ordering hypothesis can be reached with an exposure of about 6.5 years $\times$ 26.6~GW thermal power.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Charge Amplification in Low Pressure CF4:SF6:He Mixtures with a Multi-Mesh ThGEM for Directional Dark Matter Searches</strong>, F. D. Amaro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17967v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.17967v1</a></p>

<p>The CYGNO collaboration is developing next generation directional Dark Matter (DM) detection experiments, using gaseous Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), as a robust method for identifying Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) below the Neutrino Fog. SF6 is potentially ideal for this since it provides a high fluorine content, enhancing sensitivity to spin-dependent interactions and, as a Negative Ion Drift (NID) gas, reduces charge diffusion leading to improved positional resolution. CF4, although not a NID gas, has also been identified as a favourable gas target as it provides a scintillation signal which can be used for a complimentary light/charge readout approach. These gases can operate at low pressures to elongate Nuclear Recoil (NR) tracks and facilitate directional measurements. In principle, He could be added to low pressure SF6/CF4 without significant detriment to the length of 16S, 12C, and 19F recoils. This would improve the target mass, sensitivity to lower WIMP masses, and offer the possibility of atmospheric operation; potentially reducing the cost of a containment vessel. In this article, we present gas gain and energy resolution measurements, taken with a Multi-Mesh Thick Gaseous Electron Multiplier (MMThGEM), in low pressure SF6 and CF4:SF6 mixtures following the addition of He. We find that the CF4:SF6:He mixtures tested were able to produce gas gains on the order of 10^4 up to a total pressure of 100 Torr. These results demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement in charge amplification in NID gas mixtures with a He component.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Strong limits on keV-scale galactic sterile neutrino dark matter with stray light from NuSTAR after 11 years of operation</strong>, R. A. Krivonos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17861v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.17861v1</a></p>

<p>Using tremendous photon statistics gained with the stray light aperture of the NuSTAR telescope over 11 years of operation, we set strong limits on the emission of close to monochromatic photons from the radiative decays of putative dark matter sterile neutrinos in the Milky Way. In the energy range of 3-20 keV covered by the NuSTAR, the obtained limits reach the edge of theoretical predictions of realistic models leaving only a small room left to explore.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Prediction of Energy Resolution in the JUNO Experiment</strong>, JUNO Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17860v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.17860v1</a></p>

<p>This paper presents the energy resolution study in the JUNO experiment, incorporating the latest knowledge acquired during the detector construction phase. The determination of neutrino mass ordering in JUNO requires an exceptional energy resolution better than 3\% at 1 MeV. To achieve this ambitious goal, significant efforts have been undertaken in the design and production of the key components of the JUNO detector. Various factors affecting the detection of inverse beta decay signals have an impact on the energy resolution, extending beyond the statistical fluctuations of the detected number of photons, such as the properties of liquid scintillator, performance of photomultiplier tubes, and the energy reconstruction algorithm. To account for these effects, a full JUNO simulation and reconstruction approach is employed. This enables the modeling of all relevant effects and the evaluation of associated inputs to accurately estimate the energy resolution. The study reveals an energy resolution of 2.95\% at 1 MeV. Furthermore, the study assesses the contribution of major effects to the overall energy resolution budget. This analysis serves as a reference for interpreting future measurements of energy resolution during JUNO data taking. Moreover, it provides a guideline in comprehending the energy resolution characteristics of liquid scintillator-based detectors.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>The flavor-dependent $U(1)_F$ model</strong>, Jin-Lei Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17807v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.17807v1</a></p>

<p>A flavor-dependent model (FDM) is proposed in this work. The model extends the Standard Model by an extra $U(1)_F$ local gauge group, two scalar doublets, one scalar singlet and two right-handed neutrinos, where the additional $U(1)_F$ charges are related to the particles’ flavor. The new fermion sector in the FDM can explain the flavor mixings puzzle and the mass hierarchy puzzle simultaneously, and the nonzero Majorana neutrino masses can be obtained naturally by the Type I see-saw mechanism. In addition, the $B$ meson rare decay processes $\bar B \to X_s\gamma$, $B_s^0 \to \mu^+\mu^-$, the top quark rare decay processes $t\to ch$, $t\to uh$ and the $\tau$ lepton flavor violation processes $\tau\to 3e$, $\tau\to 3\mu$, $\mu\to 3e$ predicted in the FDM are analyzed.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>JUNO Sensitivity to Invisible Decay Modes of Neutrons</strong>, JUNO Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17792v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.17792v1</a></p>

<p>We explore the bound neutrons decay into invisible particles (e.g., $n\rightarrow 3 \nu$ or $nn \rightarrow 2 \nu$) in the JUNO liquid scintillator detector. The invisible decay includes two decay modes: $ n \rightarrow { inv} $ and $ nn \rightarrow { inv} $. The invisible decays of $s$-shell neutrons in $^{12}{\rm C}$ will leave a highly excited residual nucleus. Subsequently, some de-excitation modes of the excited residual nuclei can produce a time- and space-correlated triple coincidence signal in the JUNO detector. Based on a full Monte Carlo simulation informed with the latest available data, we estimate all backgrounds, including inverse beta decay events of the reactor antineutrino $\bar{\nu}_e$, natural radioactivity, cosmogenic isotopes and neutral current interactions of atmospheric neutrinos. Pulse shape discrimination and multivariate analysis techniques are employed to further suppress backgrounds. With two years of exposure, JUNO is expected to give an order of magnitude improvement compared to the current best limits. After 10 years of data taking, the JUNO expected sensitivities at a 90% confidence level are $\tau/B( n \rightarrow { inv} ) &gt; 5.0 \times 10^{31} \, {\rm yr}$ and $\tau/B( nn \rightarrow { inv} ) &gt; 1.4 \times 10^{32} \, {\rm yr}$.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Manifestation of antiquark nuggets in collisions with the Earth</strong>, V. V. Flambaum et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17775v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.17775v1</a></p>

<p>Antiquark nuggets are hypothetical compact composite objects conjectured to account for a significant fraction of dark matter in the Universe. In contrast to quark nuggets, these objects consist of antimatter. They may remain undetected if they possess a sufficiently small cross section relative to their mass. In this paper, we investigate the allowed region in the parameter space of this model that is consistent with the observed neutrino flux from the Sun and the Earth, and the non-observation of seismic events with specific signatures of dark matter particles. We found the allowed values of the antibaryon charge number in this model to be in the interval $2\times 10^{24}&lt;A&lt;8\times 10^{25}$, while the probability of nucleon annihilation upon collisions with the antiquark core is constrained by $0.1\lesssim \kappa&lt;0.25$. Although very large values of the antibaryon charge, $A&gt;10^{33}$, are not fully excluded by the present study, we show that they conflict with the non-observation of rare catastrophic explosion-like events on the Earth.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Implications of neutrino species number and summed mass measurements in cosmological observations</strong>, N. Sasao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17760v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.17760v1</a></p>

<p>We confront measurable neutrino degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$ and summed neutrino mass in the early universe to particle physics at the energy scale beyond the standard model (BSM), in particular including the issue of neutrino mass type distinction. The Majorana-type of massive neutrino is perfectly acceptable by Planck observations, while the Dirac-type neutrino may survive in a restricted class of models that suppresses extra right-handed contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff} = N_{\rm eff} - 3$ at a nearly indistinguishable level from the Majorana case. There is a chance that supersymmetry energy scale may be identified in supersymmetric extension of left-right symmetric model if improved $N_{\rm eff}$ measurements discover a finite value. Combined analysis of this quantity with the summed neutrino mass helps to determine the neutrino mass ordering pattern, if measurement accuracy of order, $60 \sim 80\,$meV, is achieved, as in CMB-S4.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>Detecting the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Primordial Black Holes in Slow-reheating Scenarios</strong>, Luis E. Padilla et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19271v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19271v1</a></p>

<p>After primordial inflation, the universe may have experienced a prolonged reheating epoch, potentially leading to a phase of matter domination supported by the oscillating inflaton field. During such an epoch, perturbations in the inflaton virialize upon reentering the cosmological horizon, forming inflaton structures. If the primordial overdensities are sufficiently large, these structures collapse to form primordial black holes (PBHs). To occur at a significant rate, this process requires an enhanced primordial power spectrum (PPS) at small scales. The enhancement of the PPS, as well as the formation and tidal interaction of the primordial structures, will in turn source a stochastic gravitational wave background(SGWB) that could be detected by current and/or future gravitational wave detectors. In this paper, we study the SGWB arising from these different sources during slow-reheating, focusing on a PPS that satisfies the requirements necessary for the formation of PBHs with a mass of $M_{\rm PBH}\simeq 10^{21}$ and that constitute the entirety of dark matter in the universe.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>Dark matter admixed neutron stars with a realistic nuclear equation of state from chiral nuclear interactions</strong>, Domenico Scordino et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19251v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19251v1</a></p>

<p>We study the effects of dark matter on the structural properties of neutron stars. In particular we investigate how the presence of a dark matter component influences the mass-radius relation, the value of the maximum mass of a neutron star and others stellar properties. To model ordinary matter we use a state-of-the-art equation of state of $\beta$-stable nuclear matter obtained using the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock quantum many-body approach starting from two-body and three-body nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory. The dark matter component of the star is modeled as a non-self-annihilating system of spin $1/2$ fermions and its equation of state as an ideal relativistic Fermi gas. The equilibrium configurations of these dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) are calculated by solving a generalization of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to the case where the system consists of two perfect fluids interacting solely through gravity. We find that, depending on the dark matter particle mass $m_\chi$, one can have somehow opposite effects on the stellar properties. In the case $m_\chi = 1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, the stellar gravitational maximum mass $M_{max}$ decreases, whereas in the case $m_\chi = 0.1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, $M_{max}$ increases with respect to the maximum mass of ordinary neutron stars. We also show that the presence of dark matter has indirect sizeable effect on the proton fraction in the ordinary matter fluid and, in the case $m_\chi = 1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, results in a decrease of the threshold gravitational mass $M_{tot}^{durca}$ for having direct URCA processes and fast stellar cooling. Finally we study the stability of dark matter admixed neutron stars with respect to radial perturbations.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>Intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals with general dynamical friction in dark matter minispikes</strong>, Yu-Chen Zhou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19240v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19240v1</a></p>

<p>The intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) may be surrounded by dark matter (DM) minispikes. The dynamical friction from these DM minispike structures can affect the dynamics and the gravitational wave (GW) emission of the IMRIs. We analyze the effects of general dynamical friction, with a particular contribution from DM particles moving faster than the stellar-mass black hole in an eccentric IMRI. The results show that the dynamical friction caused by these DM particles tends to eccentricify the orbit, and the general dynamical friction is able to increase the eccentricity. We also analyze the effects of general dynamical friction on the GW characteristic strain. The results indicate that the peak value of the characteristic strain occurs at higher frequencies as the power law index of DM minispike $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ increases. For the first time, a general analytical relation between the frequency peak value of characteristic strain of GWs and $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ is established. Using the analytical relation, the presence of DM and its halo density may be determined potentially from future GW data.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>On the Galactic rotation curve inferred from the Jeans equations Assessing its robustness using Gaia DR3 and cosmological simulations</strong>, Orlin Koop et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19028v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.19028v1</a></p>

<p>Several works have recently applied Jeans modelling to Gaia-based datasets to infer the circular velocity curve for the Milky Way. Such works have consistently found evidence for a continuous decline in the rotation curve beyond $\sim$15kpc possibly indicative of a light dark matter halo. We used Gaia DR3 RVS data, supplemented with Bayesian distances to determine the radial variation of the second moments of the velocity distribution for stars close to the Galactic plane. We have used these profiles to determine the rotation curve using the Jeans equations under the assumption of axisymmetry and explored how they vary with azimuth and above and below the Galactic disk plane. We have applied the same methodology to an N-body simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy impacted by a satellite akin the Sagittarius dwarf and to the Auriga suite of cosmological simulations. We reveal evidence of disequilibrium and deviations from axisymmetry closer in. We find that the second moment of $V_R$ flattens out at $R \gtrsim 12.5$kpc, and that the second moment of $V_{\phi}$ is different above and below the plane for $R \gtrsim 11$kpc. The simulations indicate that these features are typical of galaxies that have been perturbed by external satellites. They also suggest that the difference between the true circular velocity curve and that inferred from Jeans equations can be as high as 15$\%$, but is likely of order 10$\%$ for the Milky Way. This is of larger amplitude than the systematics inherent to Jeans equations. However, if the density of the tracer population were truncated at large radii, the erroneous conclusion of a steeply declining rotation curve can be reached. We find that steady-state axisymmetric Jeans modelling becomes less robust at large radii, indicating that particular caution is needed when interpreting the rotation curve inferred in those regions.</p>

<p>The Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson, the most recently discovered elementary particle, may still serve as a mediator between the SM sector and a new physics sector related to dark matter (DM). The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has not yet fully constrained the physics associated with the Higgs boson, leaving room for such possibilities. Among the various potential mass scales of the dark sector, the sub-GeV mass range is particularly intriguing. This parameter space presents significant challenges for DM direct detection experiments that rely on nuclear recoils. Various innovative experimental methods are currently under investigation to explore this sub-GeV dark sector. The LHC, functioning as a Higgs factory, could explore this sector once the challenge of identifying DM signals is resolved. Due to the significantly lower mass of particles in the dark sector compared to the Higgs boson, these particles are expected to be highly boosted following the Higgs boson’s decay. However, detecting and identifying these highly boosted particles remains a considerable challenge at the LHC, despite their eventual decay into SM particles. We employ a well-motivated leptophobic $Z^{\prime}_B$ model as a prototype to analyze the distinctive signatures from Higgs boson exotic decays into multi-photons. These signatures consist of collimated photons that fail to meet the photon isolation criteria, forming jet-like objects. Conventional analyses relying solely on the purity of energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter would fail to detect these signatures, as they would be overwhelmed by background events from Quantum Chromodynamics. To effectively distinguish between such novel signal signatures and SM background events, we leverage advanced machine learning techniques, specifically the transformer encoder in a multimodal network structure.</p>

<p>In this article, we anchor our analysis on the premise that the presence of a photon sphere is an intrinsic characteristic of any ultra-compact gravitational structure with spherical symmetry. Utilizing the concept of a topological photon sphere, we categorize the behaviors of diverse gravitational models based on the structure of their photon spheres. This innovative approach enables us to define boundaries for black hole parameters, which subsequently allows us to classify the model as either a black hole or a naked singularity. Indeed, we will demonstrate that the existence of this reciprocal relationship between the gravitational structure and the presence of a photon sphere offers a unique advantage that can be directly and inversely harnessed. Furthermore, we present a precise correlation between the behavior of the defined effective potential and the total topological charge for each model. Through an independent examination of the effective potential, we show that a gravitational model typically exhibits naked singularity behavior when at least one effective potential minimum (a stable photon sphere) protrudes beyond the event horizon. Finally, we will compare the effect of adding perfect fluid dark matter to the models under study and observe the impact of this quantity on the behavior of the photon sphere and the extent of their dominance.</p>

<p>2024-05-29, <strong>A two-phase model of galaxy formation: III. The formation of globular clusters</strong>, Yangyao Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18735v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18735v1</a></p>

<p>We develop a model of globular cluster (GC) formation within the cosmological hierarchy of structure formation. The model is rooted in the `two-phase’ scenario of galaxy formation developed in Paper-I, where the fast accretion of dark matter halos at high redshift leads to the formation of self-gravitating, turbulent gas clouds that subsequently fragment into dynamically hot systems of dense sub-clouds with masses $\sim 10^6$-$10^7 M_\odot$. Here we elaborate on the formation, evolution, and fate of these sub-clouds, and show that some of the sub-clouds can be compactified via two distinctive channels into a ‘supernova-free’ regime to form two distinct populations of GCs. The model is simple, characterized by a small number of free parameters underpinned by physical considerations, and can be efficiently implemented into cosmological N-body simulations to generate a coherent sample of halos, galaxies, and GCs. Our model can reproduce a range of observations on GCs, including the mass function, the size-mass relation, the frequency per unit host galaxy/halo mass, the bimodal metallicity distribution, and the spatial profile. Predictions for GCs are made for both the local Universe and for redshift up to $z \approx 10$, and can be tested by upcoming observations.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Candidate strongly-lensed Type Ia supernovae in the Zwicky Transient Facility archive</strong>, A. Townsend et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18589v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18589v1</a></p>

<p>Gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae (glSNe Ia) are unique astronomical tools for studying cosmological parameters, distributions of dark matter, the astrophysics of the supernovae and the intervening lensing galaxies themselves. Only a few highly magnified glSNe Ia have been discovered by ground-based telescopes, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), but simulations predict the existence of a fainter, undetected population. We present a systematic search in the ZTF archive of alerts from 1 June 2019 to 1 September 2022. Using the AMPEL platform, we developed a pipeline that distinguishes candidate glSNe Ia from other variable sources. Initial cuts were applied to the ZTF alert photometry before forced photometry was obtained for the remaining candidates. Additional cuts were applied to refine the candidates based on their light curve colours, lens galaxy colours, and the resulting parameters from fits to the SALT2 SN Ia template. Candidates were also cross-matched with the DESI spectroscopic catalogue. Seven transients passed all the cuts and had an associated galaxy DESI redshift, which we present as glSN Ia candidates. While superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) cannot be fully rejected, two events, ZTF19abpjicm and ZTF22aahmovu, are significantly different from typical SLSNe and their light curves can be modelled as two-image glSN Ia systems. From this two-image modelling, we estimate time delays of 22 $\pm$ 3 and 34 $\pm$ 1 days for the two events, respectively, which suggests that we have uncovered a population with longer time delays. The pipeline is efficient and sensitive enough to parse full alert streams. It is currently being applied to the live ZTF alert stream to identify and follow-up future candidates while active. This pipeline could be the foundation for glSNe Ia searches in future surveys, like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</p>

<p>The dark matter subhalos orbiting in a galactic halo perturb the orbits of stars in thin stellar streams. Over time the random velocities in the streams develop non-Gaussian wings. The rate of velocity increase is approximately a random walk at a rate proportional to the number of subhalos, primarily those in the mass range $\approx 10^{6-7} M_\odot$. The distribution of random velocities in long, thin, streams is measured in simulated Milky Way-like halos that develop in representative WDM and CDM cosmologies. The radial velocity distributions are well modeled as the sum of a Gaussian and an exponential. The resulting MCMC fits find Gaussian cores of 1-2 km/sec and exponential wings that increase from 3 km/sec for 5.5 keV WDM, 4 km/sec for 7 keV WDM, to 6 km/sec for a CDM halo. The observational prospects to use stream measurements to constrain the nature of galactic dark matter are discussed.</p>

<p>WIMP-type dark matter may have additional interactions that break baryon number, leading to induced nucleon decays which are subject to direct experimental constraints from proton decay experiments. In this work, we analyze a possibility of continuous baryon destruction, deriving strong limits from the dark matter accumulating inside old neutron stars, as such a process leads to excess heat generation. We construct the simplest particle dark matter model that breaks baryon and lepton numbers separately but conserves $B-L$. Virtual exchange by DM particles in this model results in di-nucleon decay via $nn\to n\bar\nu$ and $np\to ne^+$ processes.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Symbolic Regression for Beyond the Standard Model Physics</strong>, Shehu AbdusSalam et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18471v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18471v1</a></p>

<p>We propose symbolic regression as a powerful tool for studying Beyond the Standard Model physics. As a benchmark model, we consider the so-called Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, which has a four-dimensional parameter space defined at the GUT scale. We provide a set of analytical expressions that reproduce three low-energy observables of interest in terms of the parameters of the theory: the Higgs mass, the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, and the cold dark matter relic density. To demonstrate the power of the approach, we employ the symbolic expressions in a global fits analysis to derive the posterior probability densities of the parameters, which are obtained extremely rapidly in comparison with conventional methods.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Dynamical friction and measurements of the splashback radius in galaxy clusters</strong>, Talia M. O’Shea et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18468v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18468v1</a></p>

<p>The splashback radius is one popular method to constrain the size of galaxy clusters. It is typically measured through the logarithmic derivative of the galaxy number density profile, since doing so is more observationally viable and computationally inexpensive compared to other methods. However, measuring the splashback radius through the galaxy number density has consistently produced smaller values of the splashback radius than those measured with dark matter density or other processes. Dynamical friction has been posited as one possible reason that splashback radii measured through galaxy number densities are reduced, since it decays the orbits of subhaloes within the halo, however, the effects of dynamical friction cannot be isolated within cosmological simulations. Here, we present idealized simulations starting with isolated galaxy clusters drawn from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation, where we isolate dynamical friction. We show that although dynamical friction can reduce measurements of the splashback radius, it does not have a significant effect on clusters with $M_\mathrm{200,mean} &gt; 10^{14} \mathrm{M_\odot}$, and thus cannot completely account for previously measured discrepancies.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Revisiting the decoupling limit of the Georgi-Machacek model with a scalar singlet</strong>, Geneviève Bélanger et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18332v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18332v1</a></p>

<p>We study the connection between collider and dark matter phenomenology in the singlet extension of the Georgi-Machacek model. In this framework, the singlet scalar serves as a suitable thermal dark matter (DM) candidate. Our focus lies on the region $v_{\chi}&lt;1$ GeV, where $v_{\chi}$ is the common vacuum expectation value of the neutral components of the scalar triplets of the model. Setting bounds on the model parameters from theoretical, electroweak precision and LHC experimental constraints, we find that the BSM Higgs sector is highly constrained. Allowed values for the masses of the custodial fiveplets, triplets and singlet are restricted to the range $140~ {\rm GeV }&lt; M_{H_5} &lt; 350~ {\rm GeV }$, $150~ {\rm GeV }&lt; M_{H_3} &lt; 270 ~{\rm GeV }$ and $145~ {\rm GeV }&lt; M_{H} &lt; 300~ {\rm GeV }$. The extended scalar sector provides new channels for DM annihilation into BSM scalars that allow to satisfy the observed relic density constraint while being consistent with direct DM detection limits. The allowed region of the parameter space of the model can be explored in the upcoming DM detection experiments, both direct and indirect. In particular, the possible high values of BR$(H^0_5\to\gamma\gamma)$ can lead to an indirect DM signal within the reach of CTA. The same feature also provides the possibility of exploring the model at the High-Luminosity run of the LHC. In a simple cut-based analysis, we find that a signal of about $4\sigma$ significance can be achieved in final states with at least two photons for one of our benchmark points.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Population III star formation in the presence of turbulence, magnetic fields and ionizing radiation feedback</strong>, Piyush Sharda et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18265v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18265v1</a></p>

<p>Turbulence, magnetic fields and radiation feedback are key components that shape the formation of stars, especially in the metal-free environments at high redshifts where Population III stars form. Yet no 3D numerical simulations exist that simultaneously take all of these into account. We present the first suite of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation using the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code FLASH. We include both turbulent magnetic fields and ionizing radiation feedback coupled to primordial chemistry, and resolve the collapse of primordial clouds down to few au. We find that dynamically strong magnetic fields significantly slow down accretion onto protostars, while ionizing feedback is largely unable to regulate gas accretion because the partially ionized \ion{H}{ii} region gets trapped near the star due to insufficient radiative outputs from the star. The maximum stellar mass in the HD and RHD simulations that only yield one star exceeds $100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ within the first $5000\,\rm{yr}$. However, in the corresponding MHD and RMHD runs, the maximum mass of Population III star is only $60\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$. In other realizations where we observe widespread fragmentation leading to the formation of Population III star clusters, the maximum stellar mass is further reduced by a factor of few due to fragmentation-induced starvation. We thus conclude that magnetic fields are more important than ionizing feedback in regulating the mass of the star, at least during the earliest stages of Population III star formation, in typical dark matter minihaloes at $z \approx 30$.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Theoretical bounds on dark Higgs mass in a self-interacting dark matter model with $U(1)’$</strong>, Song Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18226v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18226v1</a></p>

<p>Motivated by the null results of current dark matter searches and the small-scale problems, we study a dark sector charged by a spontaneous broken gauge $U(1)’$. To explore the parameter space of this model, in addition to the consideration of the small-scale data, we also consider the theoretical bounds on the dark Higgs mass, with the upper bound coming from the tree-level perturbative unitarity and the lower bound from the one-loop Linde-Weinberg bound. We deeply examine the dependence of the Linde-Weinberg bound on gauge choice and energy scale. Combining the theoretical and observational constraints, we obtain the following ranges for the parameter space: the dark matter mass is 10-500 GeV, the mediator (dark photon) mass is 0.5-5 MeV, the dark Higgs mass is 0.05-50 MeV, the dark fine-structure constant is 0.001-0.5. We conclude that the dark Higgs in this model cannot be ignored in the phenomenological study of the dark sector.</p>

<p>Primordial black holes could constitute part or all of dark matter but they require large inhomogeneities to form in the early universe. These inhomogeneities can strongly backreact on the large scale dynamics of the universe. Stochastic inflation provides a way of studying this backreaction and getting an estimation of the abundance of primordial black holes. Because stochastic inflation focuses on large scale dynamics, it rests on the separate universe approach. However, the validity of this approach has only been checked in single field models, but not in multifield models in which we expect strong boosts in the power spectrum, leading to the formation of primordial black holes. We will check the validity of a separate universe approach in multifield models by matching it with a complete cosmological perturbation theory approach at large scales. In particular, we wish to compare these two paradigms and their differences in the adiabatic and entropic directions of the phase space. This will give us a range of validity and conditions one needs to verify in order to apply the separate universe approach and stochastic inflation in multifield models.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Euclid preparation. Observational expectations for redshift z&lt;7 active galactic nuclei in the Euclid Wide and Deep surveys</strong>, Euclid Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18126v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18126v1</a></p>

<p>We forecast the expected population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) observable in the Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) and Euclid Deep Survey (EDS). Starting from an X-ray luminosity function (XLF) we generate volume-limited samples of the AGN expected in the survey footprints. Each AGN is assigned an SED appropriate for its X-ray luminosity and redshift, with perturbations sampled from empirical distributions. The photometric detectability of each AGN is assessed via mock observation of the assigned SED. We estimate 40 million AGN will be detectable in at least one band in the EWS and 0.24 million in the EDS, corresponding to surface densities of 2.8$\times$10$^{3}$ deg$^{-2}$ and 4.7$\times$10$^{3}$ deg$^{-2}$. Employing colour selection criteria on our simulated data we select a sample of 4.8$\times$10$^{6}$ (331 deg$^{-2}$) AGN in the EWS and 1.7$\times$10$^{4}$ (346 deg$^{-2}$) in the EDS, amounting to 10% and 8% of the AGN detectable in the EWS and EDS. Including ancillary Rubin/LSST bands improves the completeness and purity of AGN selection. These data roughly double the total number of selected AGN to comprise 21% and 15% of the detectable AGN in the EWS and EDS. The total expected sample of colour-selected AGN contains 6.0$\times$10$^{6}$ (74%) unobscured AGN and 2.1$\times$10$^{6}$ (26%) obscured AGN, covering $0.02 \leq z \lesssim 5.2$ and $43 \leq \log_{10} (L_{bol} / erg s^{-1}) \leq 47$. With this simple colour selection, expected surface densities are already comparable to the yield of modern X-ray and mid-infrared surveys of similar area. The relative uncertainty on our expectation for detectable AGN is 6.7% for the EWS and 12.5% for the EDS, driven by the uncertainty of the XLF.</p>

<p>We discuss degenerate vector dark matter and dark photon that are induced from hidden $SU(2)_H$ gauge sector where it is spontaneously broken by vacuum expectation value of $SU(2)_H$ doublet. Kinetic mixing between $SU(2)_H$ and $U(1)_Y$ gauge fields can be generated by introducing dimension six operator realizing dark photon interactions. In estimating relic density we focus on the process in which dark matter annihilates into dark photons, and search for the region of dark matter mass and gauge coupling realizing observed relic density. We then discuss constraints from dark photon physics, thermalization of dark sector and direct detection of dark matter. It is then found that constraints from direct detection experiments give us the strongest upper limits on the dark photon interactions.</p>

<p>The nature of dark matter remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in elementary particle physics. It might well be that the dark matter particle belongs to a dark sector completely secluded or extremely weakly coupled to the visible sector. We demonstrate that gravitational waves arising from first order phase transitions in the early Universe can be used to look for signatures of such dark sector models connected to neutron physics. This introduces a new connection between gravitational wave physics and nuclear physics experiments. Focusing on two particular extensions of the Standard Model with dark U(1) and SU(2) gauge groups constructed to address the neutron lifetime puzzle, we show how those signatures can be searched for in future gravitational wave and astrometry experiments.</p>

<p>We present a new simulated galaxy cluster catalog based on the IllustrisTNG simulation. We use the Mulguisin (MGS) algorithm to identify galaxy overdensities. Our cluster identification differs from the previous FoF cluster identification in two aspects; 1) we identify cluster halos based on the galaxy subhalos instead of unobservable dark matter particles, and 2) we use the MGS algorithm that separates galaxy overdensities hosted by massive galaxies. Our approach provides a cluster catalog constructed similar to the observed cluster catalogs using spectroscopic surveys. The MGS cluster catalog lists 303 halos with M$_{200} &gt; 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$, including $\sim 10\%$ more than the FoF. The MGS catalog includes more systems because we separate some independent massive MGS cluster halos that are bundled into a single FoF algorithm. These independent MGS halos are apparently distinguishable in galaxy spatial distribution and the phase-space diagram. Because we constructed a refined cluster catalog that identifies local galaxy overdensities, we evaluate the effect of MGS clusters on the evolution of galaxies better than using the FoF cluster catalog. The MGS halo identification also enables effective identifications of merging clusters by selecting systems with neighboring galaxy overdensities. We thus highlight that the MGS cluster catalog is a useful tool for studying clusters in cosmological simulations and for comparing with the observed cluster samples.</p>

<p>We present a new suite of numerical simulations of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM) using the TIGRESS-NCR framework, covering a wide range of galactic conditions including metallicity. The TIGRESS-NCR framework is a model of the ISM in galactic disks that solves ideal MHD equations with self-gravity in a local shearing-box, including explicit treatment of cooling and heating processes coupled with ray-tracing UV radiation transfer and resolved supernova feedback. The TIGRESS-NCR suite presented in this paper covers metallicity variation $Z’\equiv Z/Z_\odot\sim 0.1-3$, gas surface density $\Sigma_{\rm gas}\sim5-150{\,M_{\odot}{\rm pc^{-2}}}$, and stellar surface density $\Sigma_{\rm star}\sim1-50{M_{\odot}{\rm pc^{-2}}}$, leading to emergent SFR surface density $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}\sim 10^{-4}-0.5{M_{\odot}{\rm kpc^{-2}yr^{-1}}}$ and ISM total midplane pressure $P_{\rm tot}/k_B=10^3-10^6 {\rm cm^{-3}K}$, with $P_{\rm tot}$ equal to the ISM weight $W$. In our simulation suite, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} \propto {Z’}^{0.3}$, which can be understood based on feedback physics. We present a new calibration for the components of feedback yield $\Upsilon$, defined as ratios between pressure (thermal, turbulent, and magnetic) and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$. We find that the thermal feedback yield varies sensitively as $\Upsilon_{\rm th}\propto W^{-0.46}Z’^{-0.53}$, while the combined turbulent and magnetic feedback yield shows weaker dependence $\Upsilon_{\rm turb+mag}\propto W^{-0.22}Z’^{-0.18}$. The reduced $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ at low metallicity is due mainly to enhanced thermal feedback yield resulting from reduced attenuation of UV radiation. Combining vertical dynamical equilibrium, feedback yield, and effective equation of state, we provide a new metallicity-dependent subgrid star formation prescription that can be used in cosmological simulations where the ISM is unresolved.</p>

<p>The main science aim of the BlackGEM array is to detect optical counterparts to gravitational wave mergers. Additionally, the array will perform a set of synoptic surveys to detect Local Universe transients and short time-scale variability in stars and binaries, as well as a six-filter all-sky survey down to ~22nd mag. The BlackGEM Phase-I array consists of three optical wide-field unit telescopes. Each unit uses an f/5.5 modified Dall-Kirkham (Harmer-Wynne) design with a triplet corrector lens, and a 65cm primary mirror, coupled with a 110Mpix CCD detector, that provides an instantaneous field-of-view of 2.7~square degrees, sampled at 0.564\arcsec/pixel. The total field-of-view for the array is 8.2 square degrees. Each telescope is equipped with a six-slot filter wheel containing an optimised Sloan set (BG-u, BG-g, BG-r, BG-i, BG-z) and a wider-band 440-720 nm (BG-q) filter. Each unit telescope is independent from the others. Cloud-based data processing is done in real time, and includes a transient-detection routine as well as a full-source optimal-photometry module. BlackGEM has been installed at the ESO La Silla observatory as of October 2019. After a prolonged COVID-19 hiatus, science operations started on April 1, 2023 and will run for five years. Aside from its core scientific program, BlackGEM will give rise to a multitude of additional science cases in multi-colour time-domain astronomy, to the benefit of a variety of topics in astrophysics, such as infant supernovae, luminous red novae, asteroseismology of post-main-sequence objects, (ultracompact) binary stars, and the relation between gravitational wave counterparts and other classes of transients</p>

<p>The DESI collaboration have recently analyzed their first year of data, finding a preference for thawing dark energy scenarios when using parameterized equations of state for dark energy. We investigate whether this preference persists when the data is analyzed within the context of a well-studied field theory model of thawing dark energy, exponential quintessence. No preference for this model over $\Lambda$CDM is found, and both models are poorer fits to the data than the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder $w_0$–$w_a$ parameterization. We demonstrate that the worse fit is due to a lack of sharp features in the potential that results in a slowly-evolving dark energy equation of state that does not have enough freedom to simultaneously fit the combination of the supernovae, DESI, and cosmic microwave background data. Our analysis provides guidance for constructing dynamical dark energy models that are able to better accommodate the data.</p>

<p>We develop a model of globular cluster (GC) formation within the cosmological hierarchy of structure formation. The model is rooted in the `two-phase’ scenario of galaxy formation developed in Paper-I, where the fast accretion of dark matter halos at high redshift leads to the formation of self-gravitating, turbulent gas clouds that subsequently fragment into dynamically hot systems of dense sub-clouds with masses $\sim 10^6$-$10^7 M_\odot$. Here we elaborate on the formation, evolution, and fate of these sub-clouds, and show that some of the sub-clouds can be compactified via two distinctive channels into a ‘supernova-free’ regime to form two distinct populations of GCs. The model is simple, characterized by a small number of free parameters underpinned by physical considerations, and can be efficiently implemented into cosmological N-body simulations to generate a coherent sample of halos, galaxies, and GCs. Our model can reproduce a range of observations on GCs, including the mass function, the size-mass relation, the frequency per unit host galaxy/halo mass, the bimodal metallicity distribution, and the spatial profile. Predictions for GCs are made for both the local Universe and for redshift up to $z \approx 10$, and can be tested by upcoming observations.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Candidate strongly-lensed Type Ia supernovae in the Zwicky Transient Facility archive</strong>, A. Townsend et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18589v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18589v1</a></p>

<p>Gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae (glSNe Ia) are unique astronomical tools for studying cosmological parameters, distributions of dark matter, the astrophysics of the supernovae and the intervening lensing galaxies themselves. Only a few highly magnified glSNe Ia have been discovered by ground-based telescopes, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), but simulations predict the existence of a fainter, undetected population. We present a systematic search in the ZTF archive of alerts from 1 June 2019 to 1 September 2022. Using the AMPEL platform, we developed a pipeline that distinguishes candidate glSNe Ia from other variable sources. Initial cuts were applied to the ZTF alert photometry before forced photometry was obtained for the remaining candidates. Additional cuts were applied to refine the candidates based on their light curve colours, lens galaxy colours, and the resulting parameters from fits to the SALT2 SN Ia template. Candidates were also cross-matched with the DESI spectroscopic catalogue. Seven transients passed all the cuts and had an associated galaxy DESI redshift, which we present as glSN Ia candidates. While superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) cannot be fully rejected, two events, ZTF19abpjicm and ZTF22aahmovu, are significantly different from typical SLSNe and their light curves can be modelled as two-image glSN Ia systems. From this two-image modelling, we estimate time delays of 22 $\pm$ 3 and 34 $\pm$ 1 days for the two events, respectively, which suggests that we have uncovered a population with longer time delays. The pipeline is efficient and sensitive enough to parse full alert streams. It is currently being applied to the live ZTF alert stream to identify and follow-up future candidates while active. This pipeline could be the foundation for glSNe Ia searches in future surveys, like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Extended Shock Breakout and Early Circumstellar Interaction in SN 2024ggi</strong>, Manisha Shrestha et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18490v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18490v1</a></p>

<p>We present high-cadence photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a Type II SN with flash spectroscopy features which exploded in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 at $\sim$7 Mpc. The light-curve evolution over the first 30 hours can be fit by two power law indices with a break after 22 hours, rising from $M_V \approx -12.95$ mag at +0.66 days to $M_V \approx -17.91$ mag after 7 days. In addition, the densely sampled color curve shows a strong blueward evolution over the first few days and then behaves as a normal SN II with a redward evolution as the ejecta cool. Such deviations could be due to interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). Early high- and low-resolution spectra clearly show high-ionization flash features from the first spectrum to +3.42 days after the explosion. From the high-resolution spectra, we calculate the CSM velocity to be 37 $\pm~4~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}} $. We also see the line strength evolve rapidly from 1.22 to 1.49 days in the earliest high-resolution spectra. Comparison of the low-resolution spectra with CMFGEN models suggests that the pre-explosion mass-loss rate of SN 2024ggi falls in a range of $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is similar to that derived for SN 2023ixf. However, the rapid temporal evolution of the narrow lines in the spectra of SN 2024ggi ($R_\mathrm{CSM} \sim 2.7 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{cm}$) could indicate a smaller spatial extent of the CSM than in SN 2023ixf ($R_\mathrm{CSM} \sim 5.4 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{cm}$) which in turn implies lower total CSM mass for SN 2024ggi.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>Filamentary Hierarchies and Superbubbles: Galactic Multiscale MHD Simulations of GMC to Star Cluster Formation</strong>, Bo Zhao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18474v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18474v1</a></p>

<p>There is now abundant observational evidence that star formation is a highly dynamical process that connects filament hierarchies and supernova feedback from galaxy scale kpc filaments and superbubbles, to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) on 100 pc scales and star clusters (1 pc). Here we present galactic multi-scale MHD simulations that track the formation of structure from galactic down to sub pc scales in a magnetized, Milky Way like galaxy undergoing supernova driven feedback processes. We do this by adopting a novel zoom-in technique that follows the evolution of typical 3-kpc sub regions without cutting out the surrounding galactic environment, allowing us to reach 0.28 pc resolution in the individual zoom-in regions. We find a wide range of morphologies and hierarchical structure including superbubbles, turbulence, kpc atomic gas filaments hosting multiple GMC condensations that are often associated with superbubble compression; down to smaller scale filamentary GMCs and star cluster regions within them. Gas accretion and compression ultimately drive filaments over a critical, scale - dependent, line mass leading to gravitational instabilities that produce GMCs and clusters. In quieter regions, galactic shear can produce filamentary GMCs within flattened, rotating disk-like structures on 100 pc scales. Strikingly, our simulations demonstrate the formation of helical magnetic fields associated with the formation of these disk like structures.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>A path towards constraining the evolution of the interstellar medium and outflows in the Milky Way using APOGEE</strong>, Piyush Sharda et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18223v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.18223v2</a></p>

<p>In recent years, the study of the Milky Way has significantly advanced due to extensive spectroscopic surveys of its stars, complemented by astroseismic and astrometric data. However, it remains disjoint from recent advancements in understanding the physics of the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). This paper introduces a new model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way that can be constrained on stellar data, because it combines a state-of-the-art ISM model with a Milky Way stellar disc model. Utilizing a dataset of red clump stars from APOGEE, known for their precise ages and metallicities, we concentrate on the last 6 billion years – a period marked by Milky Way’s secular evolution. We examine the oxygen abundance in the low-$\alpha$ disc stars relative to their ages and birth radii, validating or constraining critical ISM parameters that remain largely unexplored in extragalactic observations. The models that successfully reproduce the radius – metallicity distribution and the age – metallicity distribution of stars without violating existing ISM observations indicate a need for modest differential oxygen enrichment in Galactic outflows, meaning that the oxygen abundance of outflows is higher than the local ISM abundance, irrespective of outflow mass loading. The models also suggest somewhat elevated ISM gas velocity dispersion levels over the past 6 billion years compared to galaxies of similar mass. The extra turbulence necessary could result from energy from gas accretion onto the Galaxy, supernovae clustering in the ISM, or increased star formation efficiency per freefall time. This work provides a novel approach to constraining the Galactic ISM and outflows, leveraging the detailed insights available from contemporary Milky Way surveys.</p>

<p>2024-05-28, <strong>The expected evolution of the binary system PTF J2238+743015.1</strong>, Luciano Piersanti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17896v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.17896v1</a></p>

<p>Binary systems made by a low-mass CO WD and a He-donor represent possible progenitors of explosive events via He-detonation, producing low-luminosity thermonuclear Supernovae with a peculiar nucleosynthetis. Recently, the binary system PTF J223857.11+743015.1 has been suggested as one. We investigate the evolution of the PTF J223857.11+743015.1 system, composed by a 0.75Msun CO WD and a 0.390Msun subdwarf, capped by a thin H-rich layer, considering rotation of the WD component. We compute the evolution of two stars simultaneously, accounting for the possible evolution of the orbital parameters, as determined by mass transfer between components and by mass ejection from the system during RLOF episodes. We consider that the WD gains angular momentum due to accretion and we follow the evolution of the angular velocity profile as due to angular momentum transport via convection and rotation-induced instabilities. As the donor H-rich envelope is transferred, the WD experiences recurrent very strong H-flashes triggering RLOF episodes during which the entire accreted matter is lost from the system. Due to mixing of chemicals by rotation-induced instabilities during the accretion phase, H-flashes occur inside the original WD. Hence, pulse-by pulse, the accretor mass is reduced down to 0.7453Msun. When He-rich matter is transferred, He-detonation does not occur in the rotating WD, which undergoes 6 very strong He-flashes and subsequent RLOF episodes. Also in this case, due to rotation-induced mixing of the accreted layers with the underlying core, the WD is eroded. Finally, when the mass transfer rate from the donor decreases, a massive He-buffer is piled-up onto the accretor which ends its life as a cooling WD. The binary system PTF J2238+743015.1 as all those binaries having similar components masses and orbital parameters are not good candidates as thermonuclear explosions progenitors.</p>
