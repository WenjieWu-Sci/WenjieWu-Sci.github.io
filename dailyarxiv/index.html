<p>2023-10-05, <strong>Singlet-doublet fermion dark matter with Dirac neutrino mass, $(g-2)<em>μ$ and $ΔN</em>{\rm eff}$</strong>, Debasish Borah et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03721v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03721v1</a></p>

<p>We study the possibility of generating light Dirac neutrino mass via scotogenic mechanism where singlet-doublet fermion dark matter (DM) plays non-trivial role in generating one-loop neutrino mass, anomalous magnetic moment of muon $(g-2)_\mu$ as well as additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta{N_{\rm eff}}$ within reach of cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We show that the Dirac nature of neutrinos can bring interesting correlations within the parameter space satisfying the $\left(g-2\right)_\mu$ anomaly and DM relic density and the effective relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta{N_{\rm eff}}$. While we stick to thermal singlet doublet DM with promising detection prospects, both thermal and non-thermal origin of $\Delta{N_{\rm eff}}$ have been explored. In addition to detection prospects at DM, $(g-2)$ and other particle physics experiments, the model remains verifiable at future CMB experiments like CMB-S4, SPT-3G.</p>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>Varying Entropy Degrees of Freedom Effects in Low-Scale Leptogenesis</strong>, Dimitrios Karamitros et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03703v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03703v1</a></p>

<p>We analyse in detail the effect of varying entropy degrees of freedom on low-scale leptogenesis models. As an archetypal model, we consider the Tri-Resonant Leptogensis${}$ (TRL) scenario introduced recently by the authors, where the neutrino-Yukawa coupling matrix is dictated by an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_n$ discrete symmetry (with $n=3,6$). TRL models exhibit no preferred direction in the leptonic flavour space and have the remarkable feature that leptogenesis can successfully take place even if all light neutrinos are strictly massless up to one-loop order. Most interestingly, for TRL scenarios with heavy Majorana neutrinos lighter than 100 GeV, temperature varying degrees of freedom associated with the entropy of the plasma have a dramatic impact on the predictions of the Baryon Asymmetry in the Universe (BAU), and sensitively depend on the freeze-out sphaleron temperature $T_{\rm sph}$. We find that this is a generic feature of most freeze-out low-scale leptogenesis models discussed in the literature. In the same context, we consider heavy-neutrino scenarios realising dynamics related to critical unstable qudits in the thermal plasma and assess their significance in generating the BAU. The phenomenological implications of TRL scenarios at the intensity and high-energy frontiers are analysed.</p>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>Hadronic processes at work in 5BZB J0630-2406</strong>, Gaëtan Fichet de Clairfontaine et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03698v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03698v1</a></p>

<p>Recent observations are shedding light on the important role that active galactic nuclei (AGN) play in the production of high-energy neutrinos. In this study, we focus on one object, 5BZB J0630-2406, which is among the blazars recently proposed as associated with neutrino emission during the first 7-yr IceCube observations. Modelling the quasi-simultaneous, broad-band spectral energy distribution, we explore various scenarios from purely leptonic to lepto-hadronic models, testing the inclusion of external photon fields. This theoretical study provides a complementary testing ground for the proposed neutrino-blazar association. Despite being historically classified as a BL Lac, our study shows that 5BZB J0630-2406 belongs to the relatively rare sub-class of high-power flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Our results indicate that interactions between protons and external radiation fields can produce a neutrino flux that is within the reach of the IceCube detector. Furthermore, the spectral shape of the X-ray emission suggests the imprint of hadronic processes related to very energetic protons.</p>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>Track-Like Event Analysis at the Baikal-GVD Neutrino Telescope</strong>, V. M. Aynutdinov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03450v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03450v1</a></p>

<p>Reconstructed tracks of muons produced in neutrino interactions provide the precise probe for the neutrino direction. Therefore, track-like events are a powerful tool to search for neutrino point sources. Recently, Baikal-GVD has demonstrated the first sample of low-energy neutrino candidate events extracted from the data of the season 2019 in a so-called single-cluster analysis - treating each cluster as an independent detector. In this paper, the extension of the track-like event analysis to a wider data set is discussed and the first high-energy track-like events are demonstrated. The status of multi-cluster track reconstruction and that of the event analysis are also discussed.</p>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>Macroscopic quantum-mechanical scattering</strong>, Marian Apostol et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03315v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03315v1</a></p>

<p>In certain conditions a macroscopic quantum-mechanical scattering may occur, which may lead to a coherent cross-section on a macroscopic scale in a monocrystal. The conditions are satisfied by neutrinos, but not satisfied by other projectiles, with a higher cross-section. This may explain Weber-type experiments of neutrino detection by a perfect, stiff sapphire monocrystal. The occurrence of coherence domains for quantum-mechanical scattering and classical diffraction is analyzed, and the force exerted upon a macroscopic target is estimated. It is concluded that neutrinos exhibit a distinctive feature in this respect, due precisely to their very small cross-section.</p>

<p>2023-10-04, <strong>OffLine simulation and reconstruction software framework for the JEM-EUSO missions</strong>, Thomas C. Paul et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03196v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03196v1</a></p>

<p>The Joint Experiment Missions for Extreme Universe Observatory comprises a collection of complementary missions dedicated to pioneering technologies and techniques for a future space-based multi-messenger observatory which will have sufficient sensitivity and exposure to measure properties of extremely rare ultra-high energy (E&gt;50 EeV) cosmic rays and very high energy (E&gt;100 PeV) neutrinos. Here we describe a general-purpose software framework designed to facilitate detailed simulation and reconstruction of events observed by the various missions using both detection of fluorescence and Cherenkov light produced when cosmic ray or neutrino-induced extensive air showers traverse Earth’s atmosphere. The software builds on a framework developed by the Pierre Auger Collaboration. We describe the techniques used to organize contributions from numerous collaborators, manage an abundance of configuration information, and provide simple access to time-dependent detector and atmospheric information. We also explain how we support a multitude of computing platforms, provide fast installation and maintain the broad testing coverage required for stability of the large and heterogeneous code base. We provide a few examples of simulated and reconstructed data gathered by some of the JEM-EUSO missions, including the EUSO-SPB2 instrument.</p>

<p>2023-10-04, <strong>A lepton model with nearly Cobimaximal mixing</strong>, Juan Carlos Gómez-Izquierdo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03000v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03000v1</a></p>

<p>Cobimaximal mixing predicts $\pi/4$ and $3\pi/2$ for the atmospheric angle and the Dirac CP-violating phase, respectively. These values are in tension with the neutrino globals fits. If this pattern was behind the lepton mixings, then it would have to be broken. In that case, in this paper, we explore the $\mathbf{S}_{3}$ flavor symmetry within the $B-L$ gauge model where the aforementioned scheme comes from the neutrino sector but the charged lepton contribution breaks the well known predictions so the mixing observables as well as the $m_{ee}$ mass can be accommodated quite well according to the available data. Notably, the predicted regions for the Dirac CP-violating phase would allow to test the model in future experiments.</p>

<p>2023-10-04, <strong>Evolutionary tracks of massive stars with different rotation and metallicity in neutrino H-R diagram</strong>, Hao Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02824v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.02824v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino losses play a crucial role in the evolution of massive stars. We study the neutrino luminosity of stars ranging from 20 to 90 M_{\odot} from Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) to Fe Core Collapse (FeCC) with different rotation and metallicity in a neutrino Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. In our simulations, we consider {\omega}/{\omega}crit = 0 and 0.7 to represent non-rotation and high rotation, respectively, and set the metallicities to 0.014, 0.001, and 0.0001. During hydrogen burning stages, neutrino luminosity primarily originates from CNO cycle, and increases with higher stellar mass while decreasing with increasing metallicity. For the high metallicity models (Z = 0.014) during the helium burning stage, the reduction of the hydrogen envelope caused by a larger mass loss rate leads to a gradual decrease in neutrino luminosity. The rapid rotation results in extra mixing inside massive stars, which increases the neutrino luminosity during main sequence (MS), while decreases the neutrino luminosity during helium burning phase. Simultaneously, the rapid rotation also increases CO core mass, which enhances the neutrino luminosity during C and O burning phase. We also investigate the effect of neutrino magnetic moment (NMM) on the massive stars. We find that the energy loss caused by the NMM does not have effects on the evolutionary destiny of massive stars, and it does not significant change the compactness at the time of Fe core collapse.</p>

<p>2023-10-04, <strong>Possible explanation of not observing ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos</strong>, Jakub Rembielinski et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02763v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.02763v1</a></p>

<p>Assuming that neutrinos are spacelike (tachyonic) fermions, we calculate width for the kinematically allowed, lepton number conserving, three-body decay $\nu_{\alpha}\rightarrow \nu_{\alpha} \; \nu_{\beta} \bar{\nu}_{\beta}$ in the Standard Model. Decays of tachyonic neutrinos over cosmological distances can lead to a reduction of the neutrino flux in the high-energy end of the spectrum. We estimate upper limits on the spacelike neutrino mass based on the PeV-energy cosmological neutrino events observed in the IceCube experiment. These limits are close to those deduced from the measurements of $m_{\nu}^2$ in the tritium-decay experiment KATRIN.</p>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>Relic density of asymmetric dark matter and constraints on the parameter spaces</strong>, Qiu Sujuan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03711v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03711v1</a></p>

<p>Based on the cosmological observations, the baryon and dark matter energy densities are similar. There may exist an asymmetry between the dark matter particles and their corresponding anti–particles. We review the relic density of asymmetric dark matter particle and anti–particle in the standard cosmological scenario and quintessence model with kination phase. Then we use the Planck data to find constraints on the annihilation cross section and the mass of the asymmetric dark matter in those models.</p>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>The Right-Handed Slepton Bulk Region for Dark Matter in Generalized No-scale $\mathcal{F}$-$SU(5)$ with Effective Super-Natural Supersymmetry</strong>, Tianjun Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03622v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03622v1</a></p>

<p>We propose Generalized No-Scale Supergravity, the simplest scenario for Effective Super-Natural Supersymmetry, naturally solving the supersymmetry electroweak fine-tuning problem and including natural dark matter. A light right-handed slepton bulk region is realized in $\mathcal{F}$-$SU(5)$ and the pMSSM. Though beyond the LHC reach, the bulk can be probed at the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee), Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), and Hyper-Kamiokande.</p>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>The Intracluster Light and its Link with the Dynamical State of the Host Group/Cluster: the Role of the Halo Concentration</strong>, E. Contini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03263v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03263v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate on the role of the halo concentration in the formation of the intra-cluster light (ICL) in galaxy groups and clusters, as predicted by a state-of-art semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, coupled with a set of high-resolution dark matter only simulations. The analysis focuses on how the fraction of ICL correlates with halo mass, concentration and fraction of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in a large sample of groups and clusters with $13.0\leq \log M_{halo} \leq 15.0$. The fraction of ICL follows a normal distribution, a consequence of the stochastic nature of the physical processes responsible for the formation of the diffuse light. The fractional budget of ICL depends on both halo mass (very weakly) until group scales, and concentration (remarkably). More interestingly, the ICL fraction is higher in more concentrated objects, a result of the stronger tidal forces acting in the innermost regions of the haloes where the concentration is the quantity playing the most relevant role. Our model predictions do not show any dependence between the ICL and ETGs fractions and so, we instead suggest the concentration rather than the mass, as recently claimed, to be the main driver of the ICL formation. The diffuse light starts to form in groups via stellar stripping and mergers and later assembled in more massive objects. However, the formation and assembly keep going on group/cluster scales at lower redshift through the same processes, mainly via stellar stripping in the vicinity of the central regions where tidal forces are stronger.</p>

<p>2023-10-04, <strong>Star formation and AGN activity 500 Myr after the Big Bang: Insights from JWST</strong>, Jordan C. J. D’Silva et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03081v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03081v1</a></p>

<p>We consider the effect of including an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) component when fitting spectral energy distributions of 109 spectroscopically confirmed $z\approx 3.5-12.5$ galaxies with JWST. Remarkably, we find that the resulting cosmic star formation history is $\approx 0.9$ dex lower at $z\gtrsim 9.5$ when an AGN component is included in the fitting. This alleviates previously reported excess star formation at $z\gtrsim 9.5$ compared to models based on typical baryon conversion efficiencies inside dark matter halos. We find that the individual stellar masses and star formation rates can be as much as $\approx 4$ dex lower when fitting with an AGN component. These results highlight the importance of considering both stellar mass assembly and super massive black hole growth when interpreting the light distributions of among the first galaxies to ever exist.</p>

<p>2023-10-04, <strong>Bi-gravity Portal Dark Matter</strong>, Qing Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03079v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03079v1</a></p>

<p>We consider a model where the interaction between dark matter and the Standard Model particles are mediated by a ghost-free bi-gravity portal. The bi-gravity model invokes a massive spin-2 particle coupled to the usual massless graviton as well as generic bi-metric matter couplings. The cross-sections for dark matter direct detection are computed and confronted with the experimental bounds. The presence of the massive spin-2 mediator resolves the core-cusp problem, which in turn significantly constrains the dark matter coupling in such a bi-gravity theory. Yet, there remains a window of the parameter space where the model can be tested in the upcoming direct detection experiments such as XENONnT and PandaX-30T. The model also predicts a reheating temperature of the order of $10^6$ GeV.</p>

<p>2023-10-04, <strong>On the ellipticity parameterization for an NFW profile: an overlooked angular structure in strong lens modeling</strong>, Matthew R. Gomer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03077v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03077v1</a></p>

<p>Galaxy-scale gravitational lenses are often modeled with two-component mass profiles where one component represents the stellar mass and the second is an NFW profile representing the dark matter. Outside of the spherical case, the NFW profile is costly to implement, and so it is approximated via two different methods; ellipticity can be introduced via the lensing potential (NFWp) or via the mass by approximating the NFW profile as a sum of analytical profiles (NFWm). While the NFWp method has been the default for lensing applications, it gives a different prescription of the azimuthal structure, which we show introduces ubiquitous gradients in ellipticity and boxiness in the mass distribution rather than having a constant elliptical shape. Because unmodeled azimuthal structure has been shown to be able to bias lens model results, we explore the degree to which this introduced azimuthal structure can affect the model accuracy. We construct input profiles using composite models using both the NFWp and NFWm methods and fit these mocks with a power-law elliptical mass distribution (PEMD) model with external shear. As a measure of the accuracy of the recovered lensing potential, we calculate the value of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ one would determine from the lensing fit. We find that the fits to the NFWp input return $H_0$ values which are systematically biased by about $3\%$ lower than the NFWm counterparts. We explore whether such an effect is attributable to the mass sheet transformation (MST) by using an MST-independent quantity, $\xi_2$. We show that, as expected, the NFWm mocks are degenerate with PEMD through an MST. For the NFWp, an additional bias is found beyond the MST due to azimuthal structures {\it exterior to the Einstein radius}. We recommend modelers use an NFWm prescription in the future, such that azimuthal structure can be introduced explicitly rather than implicitly.</p>

<p>2023-10-04, <strong>Weak-Lensing Detection of Intracluster Filaments in the Coma Cluster</strong>, Kim HyeongHan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03073v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03073v1</a></p>

<p>Our concordance cosmological model predicts that galaxy clusters grow at the intersection of filaments structuring the cosmic web stretching tens of Mega parsecs. Although this hypothesis has been supported by the baryonic components, no observational study has detected the dark matter component of the intracluster filaments (ICFs), the terminal segment of the large-scale cosmic filaments at their conjunction with individual clusters. We report weak-lensing detection of ICFs in the Coma cluster field from the ~12 sq. deg Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging data. The detection is based on two methods: matched-filter technique and shear-peak statistic. The matched-filter technique (shear-peak statistic) yields detection significances of 6.6- (3.1) $\sigma$ and 3.6- (2.8) $\sigma$ for the northern and western ICFs at 110$^{\circ}$ and 340$^{\circ}$, respectively.

<p>The reach of sub-GeV dark-matter detectors is at present severely affected by low-energy events from various origins. We present the theoretical methods to compute the single- and few-electron events that arise from secondary radiation emitted by high-energy particles passing through detector materials and perform simulations to quantify them at (Skipper) CCD-based experiments, focusing on the SENSEI data collected in the MINOS cavern at Fermilab. The simulations account for the generation of secondaries from Cherenkov and luminescent recombination; photo-absorption, reflection, refraction and thin-film interference in detector materials; roughness of the interfaces and the dynamics of charges and partial charge collection (PCC) in the doped CCD-backside. We consider several systematic uncertainties, notably those stemming from the backside charge-diffusion modeling, which we estimate with a “fiducial’’ and an “extreme’’ model, with the former model presenting better agreement with PCC data. We find that Cherenkov photons constitute about 40% of the observed single-electron events for both models; radiative recombination rates are negligible for the fiducial model, but can dominate over the Cherenkov rates for the extreme model. We also estimate the fraction of 2-electron events from 1-electron event same-pixel coincidences, finding that the entire 2-electron rate can be explained by coincidences of radiative events and spurious charge. Accounting for backgrounds, we project the sensitivity of future Skipper-CCD-based experiments to different dark-matter models. For light-mediator models with dark-matter masses of 1, 5, and 10 MeV, we find that future experiments with 10-kg-year exposures and successful background mitigation could have a sensitivity that is larger by 9, 3, and 2 orders of magnitude, respectively, when compared to an experiment without background improvements.

<p>The galaxy total mass inside the effective radius encode important information on the dark matter and galaxy evolution model. Total “central” masses can be inferred via galaxy dynamics or with gravitational lensing, but these methods have limitations. We propose a novel approach, based on Random Forest, to make predictions on the total and dark matter content of galaxies using simple observables from imaging and spectroscopic surveys. We use catalogs of multi-band photometry, sizes, stellar mass, kinematic “measurements” (features) and dark matter (targets) of simulated galaxies, from Illustris-TNG100 hydrodynamical simulation, to train a Mass Estimate machine Learning Algorithm (Mela). We separate the simulated sample in passive early-type galaxies (ETGs), both “normal” and “dwarf”, and active late-type galaxies (LTGs) and show that the mass estimator can accurately predict the galaxy dark masses inside the effective radius in all samples. We finally test the mass estimator against the central mass estimates of a series of low redshift (z$\leq$0.1) datasets, including SPIDER, MaNGA/DynPop and SAMI dwarf galaxies, derived with standard dynamical methods based on Jeans equations. Dynamical masses are reproduced within 0.30 dex ($\sim2\sigma$), with a limited fraction of outliers and almost no bias. This is independent of the sophistication of the kinematical data collected (fiber vs. 3D spectroscopy) and the dynamical analysis adopted (radial vs. axisymmetric Jeans equations, virial theorem). This makes Mela a powerful alternative to predict the mass of galaxies of massive stage-IV surveys’ datasets.</p>

<p>Galactic winds play a crucial role in the ejection of the interstellar medium (ISM) into intergalactic space. This study presents a model that classifies possible transonic solutions of galactic winds in the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo and stellar component under spherically symmetric and steady assumptions. Our model includes injections of mass and energy resulting from supernovae feedback along a flow line. The mass flux in galactic winds is a critical factor in determining the acceleration process of the flow and revealing the impact of galactic winds on galaxy evolution. We apply the transonic galactic wind model to the observed outflow velocities of star-forming galaxies to estimate the mass flux. Dividing the mass flux by the star formation rate (SFR) yields the mass loading rate (and mass loading factor), which indicates the entrainment effect of the ISM by the hot gas flow. Our results demonstrate that the mass loading rate is inversely correlated with galaxy mass and SFR. In less massive galaxies (stellar mass $\sim 10^{7-8} M_\odot$), the mass loading rate exceeds unity, indicating effective ejection of the ISM into intergalactic space. However, in massive galaxies (stellar mass $\sim 10^{10-11} M_\odot$), the mass loading rate falls below unity, meaning that the mass flux cannot exceed the injected mass by supernovae, thus resulting in the ineffective ejection of the ISM.</p>

<p>According to the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model of galaxy formation, the hierarchical assembly process is scale-free and interactions between galaxies in all mass ranges are expected. The effects of interactions between dwarf galaxies on their evolution are not well understood. In this study, we aim to understand the effect of low-mass galaxy interactions on their star formation rate (SFR). We estimated the SFR of 22 interacting and 36 single gas-rich dwarf galaxies in the Lynx-Cancer void region using their far-ultraviolet (FUV) images from the GALEX mission. We find an enhancement in SFR by a factor of 3.4$\pm$1.2 for interacting systems compared to single dwarf galaxies in the stellar mass range of 10$^{7}$ - 10$^{8}$ M$\odot$. Our results indicate that dwarf - dwarf galaxy interactions can lead to an enhancement in their SFR. These observations are similar to the predictions based on the simulations of dwarf galaxies at lower redshifts. Future deeper and higher-spatial-resolution UV studies will help us to understand the effect of dwarf galaxy interactions on the spatial distribution of star forming clumps and to identify star formation in tidal tails.</p>

<p>The simplest cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM) is well-known to suffer from the Hubble tension, namely an almost $5 \sigma$ discrepancy between the (model-based) early-time determination of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and its late-time (and model-independent) determination. To circumvent this, we introduce an additional energy source that varies with the redshift as $(1 + z)^n$, where $0 &lt; n &lt; 3$, and test it against the Pantheon Compilation of Type Ia Supernovae as well as the CMBR observations (at $z \approx 1100$). The deduced $H_0$ is now well-consistent with the value obtained from local observations of Cepheid variables. Suggesting a non-zero value for the curvature density parameter, positive (negative) for $n &gt; 2$ ($n &lt; 2$), the resolution is also consistent with the BAO data.</p>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>Serendipitous detection of the dusty Type IIL SN 1980K with JWST/MIRI</strong>, Szanna Zsíros et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03448v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03448v1</a></p>

<p>We present mid-infrared (mid-IR) imaging of the Type IIL supernova (SN) 1980K with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) more than 40 yr post-explosion. SN 1980K, located in the nearby ($D\approx7$ Mpc) “SN factory” galaxy NGC 6946, was serendipitously captured in JWST/MIRI images taken of the field of SN 2004et in the same galaxy. SN 1980K serves as a promising candidate for studying the transitional phase between young SNe and older SN remnants and also provides a great opportunity to investigate its the close environment. SN 1980K can be identified as a clear and bright point source in all eight MIRI filters from F560W up to F2550W. We fit analytical dust models to the mid-IR spectral energy distribution that reveal a large amount ($M_d \approx 0.002 {M}_{\odot}$) of Si-dominated dust at $T_{dust}\approx 150$ K (accompanied by a hotter dust/gas component), and also computed numerical SED dust models. Radiative transfer modeling of a late-time optical spectrum obtained recently with Keck discloses that an even larger ($\sim 0.24-0.58~{M}_{\odot}$) amount of dust is needed in order for selective extinction to explain the asymmetric line profile shapes observed in SN 1980K. As a conclusion, with JWST, we may see i) pre-existing circumstellar dust heated collisionally (or, partly radiatively), analogous to the equatorial ring of SN 1987A, or ii) the mid-IR component of the presumed newly-formed dust, accompanied by much more colder dust present in the ejecta (as suggested by the late-time the optical spectra).</p>

<p>Context. G189.6+03.3 and IC443 are two examples of supernova remnants located in a region rich of gas and dust, spatially close to the HII region S249. So far, the actual shape of IC443 is believed to be given by the past action of multiple supernova explosions, while a third unrelated might have originated G189.6+03.3.   Aims. If the IC443 nebula has been extensively observed in several bands, in opposite there is an almost complete lack of observations on the nearby and much weaker supernova remnant G189.6+03.3, discovered in 1994 with ROSAT. Given the relatively large extent of this second remnant, the new dataset provided by the X-ray telescope eROSITA onboard the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) mission gives a unique opportunity to characterize it more in depth.   Methods. We provide a full spectral characterization of G189.6+03.3 emission for the first time, together with new images covering the whole remnant. Since one of the leading hypothesis is that its emission partially overlaps with the emission of IC443, we test this scenario dividing the remnant in several regions from which we extracted the spectra.   Results. The new X-ray images provided by eROSITA show an elongated structure. Together with the detection of supersolar abundances of O, Mg, Ne and Si and subsolar abundance of Fe, these features could be an indication of a faint supernova explosion. The X-ray spectra also highlight the presence of a 0.7 keV plasma component across all the regions together with a column density almost uniform.   Conclusions. The ubiquitous presence of the 0.7 keV plasma component is a strong indication for G189.6+03.3 overlapping completely with IC443. We propose the progenitors of G189.6+03.3 and IC443 could have been hosted in a binary or multiple system, originating two explosions at different times in different positions.</p>

<p>Modern imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes have extensively observed young nearby supernova remnants (SNRs), with ages of about 1000 years or less, in the very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray band. These efforts resulted in the detection of VHE emission from three young SNRs - Cassiopeia A, Tycho, and SN 1006 - and provided significant evidence for emission from the more distant Kepler’s SNR. However, many questions on the production of VHE gamma rays in these remnants remain unanswered. Using detailed physical models for Tycho’s SNR based on the CR-hydro-NEI code and physically motivated models for the other young nearby remnants, we simulated observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) of these gamma-ray sources. We highlight properties of these remnants accessible for investigation with future CTA observations and discuss which questions are expected to be answered.</p>

<p>Pristine_183.6849+04.8619 (P1836849) is an extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H]$=-3.3\pm0.1$) star on a prograde orbit confined to the Galactic disk. Such stars are rare and may have their origins in protogalactic fragments that formed the early Milky Way, in low mass satellites that were later accreted by the Galaxy, or forming in situ in the Galactic plane. Here we present a chemo-dynamical analysis of the spectral features between $3700-11000$\r{A} from a high-resolution spectrum taken during Science Verification of the new Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST). Spectral features for many chemical elements are analysed (Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni), and valuable upper limits are determined for others (C, Na, Sr, Ba), which are all important tracers of the earliest epochs of star formation in the Galaxy. This main sequence star exhibits several rare chemical signatures, including (i) extremely low metallicity for a star in the Galactic disk, (ii) very low abundances of the light $\alpha$-elements (Na, Mg, Si) compared to metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo or disk, and (iii) unusually large abundances of Cr and Mn, where [Cr, Mn/Fe]$_{\rm NLTE}&gt;+0.5$. A simple comparison to theoretical yields from supernova models suggests that two low mass Population III objects (one 10 M$_\odot$ supernova and one 17 M$_\odot$ hypernova) can reproduce the abundance pattern well (reduced $\chi^2&lt;1$). When this star is compared to two other extremely metal-poor stars with planar orbits, differences in both chemistry and kinematics imply there is little evidence for a common origin. The unique chemistry of P1836849 is discussed in terms of the earliest stages in the formation of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>JWST is providing the unique opportunity to directly study feedback processes regulating star formation (SF) in early galaxies. The two $z&gt;5$ quiescent systems (JADES-GS-z7-01-QU and MACS0417-z5BBG) detected so far show a recent starburst after which SF is suppressed. To clarify whether such quenching is due to supernova (SN) feedback, we have developed a minimal physical model. We derive a condition on the minimum star formation rate, $\rm SFR_{min}$, lasting for a time interval $\Delta t_{b}$, required to quench SF in a galaxy at redshift $z$, with gas metallicity $Z$, and hosted by a halo of mass $M_h$. We find that lower $(z, Z, M_h)$ systems are more easily quenched. We then apply the condition to JADES-GS-z7-01-QU ($z=7.3$, $M_\star=10^{8.6} M_\odot$) and MACS0417-z5BBG ($z=5.2$, $M_\star=10^{7.6} M_\odot$), and find that SN feedback largely fails to reproduce the observed quenched SF history. Alternatively, we suggest that SF is rapidly suppressed by radiation-driven dusty outflows sustained by the high specific SFR (43 and 25 Gyr$^{-1}$, respectively) of the two galaxies. Our model provides a simple tool to interpret the SF histories of post-starburst galaxies, and unravel quenching mechanisms from incoming JWST data.</p>

<p>We present Rainbow, a physically motivated framework which enables simultaneous multi-band light curve fitting. It allows the user to construct a 2-dimensional continuous surface across wavelength and time, even in situations where the number of observations in each filter is significantly limited. Assuming the electromagnetic radiation emission from the transient can be approximated by a black-body, we combined an expected temperature evolution and a parametric function describing its bolometric light curve. These three ingredients allow the information available in one passband to guide the reconstruction in the others, thus enabling a proper use of multi-survey data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to simulated data from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) as well as real data from the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE DR1). We evaluate the quality of the estimated light curves according to three different tests: goodness of fit, time of peak prediction and ability to transfer information to machine learning (ML) based classifiers. Results confirm that Rainbow leads to equivalent (SNII) or up to 75% better (SN Ibc) goodness of fit when compared to the Monochromatic approach. Similarly, accuracy when using Rainbow best-fit values as a parameter space in multi-class ML classification improves for all classes in our sample. An efficient implementation of Rainbow has been publicly released as part of the light curve package at https://github.com/light-curve/light-curve-python. Our approach enables straight forward light curve estimation for objects with observations in multiple filters and from multiple experiments. It is particularly well suited for situations where light curve sampling is sparse.</p>

<p>Approximately one hundred sources of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays are known in the Milky Way. A survey of the entire Galactic Plane in the energy range from a few tens of GeV to a few hundred TeV has been proposed as a Key Science Project for the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). This article presents the status of the studies towards the Galactic Plane Survey (GPS). We build and make publicly available a sky model that combines data from observations of known gamma-ray emitters with state-of-the-art physically-driven models of synthetic populations of the main classes of established Galactic VHE sources, as well as of interstellar emission from cosmic-ray interactions in the Milky Way. We also perform an optimisation of the observation strategy. We use the improved sky model and observation strategy to simulate GPS data that are analysed using the methods and software tools under development for real data. We show that the GPS has the potential to increase the number of known Galactic VHE emitters by almost a factor of five. This corresponds to the detection of more than two hundred pulsar wind nebulae and a few tens of supernova remnants at average integral fluxes one order of magnitude lower than in the existing sample above 1 TeV, therefore opening the possibility to perform unprecedented population studies. The GPS also has the potential to provide new VHE detections of binary systems and pulsars, and to identify any bright PeVatrons. Furthermore, the GPS will constitute a pathfinder for deeper follow-up observations of these source classes. Finally, we show that we can extract from GPS data an estimate of the contribution to diffuse emission from unresolved sources, and that there are good prospects of detecting interstellar emission and statistically distinguishing different scenarios.

<p>2023-10-04, <strong>New Dynamical Channel: Wide Binaries in the Galactic Center as a Source of Binary Interactions</strong>, Erez Michaely et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02558v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.02558v1</a></p>

<p>The inner $500\rm pc$ in the galactic center is dense with stars and a dynamically hot environment. Here, we focus on wide binaries as a source of tidally or collisional interactions. These binaries were previously ignored as sources of binary interaction because they are too wide to have a close pericenter passage, or they will quickly become unbound (ionized) due to gravitational interactions with passing neighbors. However, we show that wide binaries tend to interact more frequently with neighboring stars due to their larger cross-section for gravitational impulse interactions. These interactions mainly torque the wide system, causing it to change its eccentricity. As a result, the eccentricity might be excited to sufficiently high values, causing the binary to interact at the pericenter. As a proof of concept, we present four channels of such interactions: binary main-sequence (MS), white-dwarf (WD) - MS, black hole - MS, and lastly, WD-WD. During Galaxy’s lifetime, we predict tens of thousands of MS-MS interacting binaries that may form G2-like objects later appear younger than their environment. X-ray signatures and, perhaps, supernovae may result from thousands of WD-MS and WD-WD interacting binaries from this channel. Lastly, we predict a few hundred BH-MS interacting binaries at the inner $500$~pc.</p>
