<p>2024-12-05, <strong>Modification on thermal motion in Geant4 for neutron capture simulation in Gadolinium loaded water</strong>, Y. Hino et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04186v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.04186v1</a></p>

<p>Neutron tagging is a fundamental technique for electron anti-neutrino detection via the inverse beta decay channel. A reported discrepancy in neutron detection efficiency between observational data and simulation predictions prompted an investigation into neutron capture modeling in Geant4. The study revealed that an overestimation of the thermal motion of hydrogen atoms in Geant4 impacts the fraction of captured nuclei. By manually modifying the Geant4 implementation, the simulation results align with calculations based on evaluated nuclear data and show good agreement with observables derived from the SK-Gd data.</p>

<p>2024-12-05, <strong>Towards a multi-tracer neutrino mass measurement with line-intensity mapping</strong>, Gali Shmueli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04071v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.04071v1</a></p>

<p>Accurately determining neutrino masses is a main objective of contemporary cosmology. Since massive neutrinos affect structure formation and evolution, probes of large scale structure are sensitive to the sum of their masses. In this work, we explore future constraints on $\sum m_\nu$ utilizing line-intensity mapping (LIM) as a promising emerging probe of the density of our Universe, focusing on the fine-structure [CII] line as an example, and compare these constraints with those derived from traditional galaxy surveys. Additionally, we perform a multi-tracer analysis using velocity tomography via the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich and moving lens effects to reconstruct the three-dimensional velocity field. Our forecasts indicate that the next-generation AtLAST detector by itself can achieve $\sigma_{\Sigma m_\nu} \sim 50$ meV sensitivity. Velocity tomography will further improve these constraints by 4%. Incorporating forecasts for CMB-S4 and DESI-BAO in a comprehensive multi-tracer analysis, while setting a prior on the optical depth to reionization $\tau$ derived using 21-cm forecasted observations, to break degeneracies, we find that a $\gtrsim5\sigma$ detection of $\sum m_\nu!\sim! 60$ meV, under the normal hierarchy, is within reach with LIM. Even without a $\tau$ prior, our combined forecast reaches $\sigma_{\Sigma m_\nu} !\sim! 18$ meV.</p>

<p>2024-12-05, <strong>First detection of a tagged neutrino in the NA62 experiment</strong>, NA62 Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04033v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.04033v1</a></p>

<p>The NA62 experiment at the CERN SPS reports the first detection of a tagged neutrino candidate based on the data collected in 2022. The candidate consists of a $K^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu_\mu$ decay where the charged particles are reconstructed and the neutrino is detected through a charged-current interaction in a liquid krypton calorimeter.</p>

<p>Interaction rates of neutrinos and antineutrinos within a QED plasma determine the dynamics of their decoupling in the early universe. We show how to define the relevant double-differential production, annihilation, and scattering rates at NLO. Integrating over these rates with specific weights, other quantities from the literature can be obtained, such as energy transfer rates, or a neutrino interaction rate. We show that NLO corrections to the energy transfer rates are as small as those that enter the previously determined neutrino interaction rate, and are therefore expected to have only a small influence on the neutrino decoupling parameter, $N_{\rm eff}\,$. We also provide a tabulation and fast interpolation routine for all double-differential rates, in order to allow for their use in non-approximate kinetic equations, which may further reduce the systematic uncertainties of the Standard Model prediction for $N_{\rm eff}\,$</p>

<h1 id="dark-matter-1">dark matter (1)</h1>

<p>2024-12-05, <strong>Gravitational wave and dark matter from Axion-Higgs string</strong>, Yongtao Jia et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04218v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.04218v1</a></p>

<p>Axions have long been considered plausible candidates for dark matter. The axion dark matter emitted from cosmic strings after the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking in the early Universe was extensively simulated. In this work, we study dark matter and gravitational waves through the lattice simulation of the Axion-Higgs string. We gave the dark matter overproduction and the Big Bang nucleosynthesis bounds on the axion decay constant $f_a$ and the axion mass $m_a$ for axion-like particles, and found that the predicted gravitational wave spectra cannot be probed by the dataset of the current pulsar timing array experiments.</p>

<p>2024-12-05, <strong>Uniting the Observed Dynamical Dark Energy Preference with the Discrepancies in $Î©_m$ and $H_0$ Across Cosmological Probes</strong>, Xianzhe TZ Tang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04430v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.04430v1</a></p>

<p>Recent results from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) indicate 1) potentially discrepant measurements of the matter density $\Omega_m$ and Hubble constant $ H_0 $ in a $\Lambda$CDM model when data are analyzed individually, and 2) hints of dynamical dark energy in a $w_0w_a$CDM model when data are combined in a joint analysis. We examine whether underlying dynamical dark energy cosmologies favored by real data would result in biases in $\Omega_m$ and $ H_0 $ for each probe when analyzed individually in a $\Lambda$CDM framework. We generate mock datasets in $w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies, fit the individual probes under the $\Lambda$CDM model, and find that expected biases in $\Omega_m$ are $\sim 0.03$. Notably, the $\Omega_m$ differences between probes are consistent with the values observed in the real datasets. We also observe that mock DESI BAO datasets generated in the $ w_0w_a $CDM cosmologies will lead to a biased measurement of $ H_0 $ higher by ($\sim1.2$km/s/Mpc) when fitted under $\Lambda$CDM, appearing to mildly improve the Hubble tension, but as the true underlying $H_0$ is lower, the tension is in fact worsened. We find that the $\Omega_m$ discrepancies, the high BAO $ H_0 $ relative to CMB, and the joint dynamical dark energy signal itself are all related effects that could be explained simultaneously with either new physics or new systematics. While we find it is possible to unite many of the discrepancies seen in recent analyses along a single axis, our results underscore the importance of understanding systematic differences in datasets, as they have unique impacts in different cosmological parameter spaces.</p>

<p>2024-12-05, <strong>The Red Supergiant Problem: As Seen from the Local Groupâs Red Supergiant Populations</strong>, Sarah Healy et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04386v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.04386v1</a></p>

<p>The red supergiant (RSG) problem, which describes the apparent lack of high-luminosity progenitors detected in Type II supernova (SN) pre-images, has been a contentious topic for two decades. We re-assess this problem using a new RSG population of the Milky Way supplemented with RSGs from other galaxies in the Local Group. In particular, we quantify the uncertainties inherent to assumptions made regarding the starâs temperature or spectral type and the corresponding bolometric correction. We find that only M3 or later RSGs reproduce the steepness seen from the SN II pre-imaged sample. To assess the significance of the RSG problem, we build a metallicity-weighted cumulative luminosity distribution of M3 or later RSGs and directly compare it to the luminosity distribution of SN II pre-imaged progenitors. We find no evidence of missing high-luminosity pre-imaged progenitors since the uncertainties on the pre-imaged SN progenitors and single-band derived luminosity are too large to meaningfully infer population differences.</p>

<p>2024-12-05, <strong>Three-dimensional velocity fields in the silicon- and sulfur-reach ejecta in the remnant of Tycho supernova</strong>, O. Petruk et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04096v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.04096v1</a></p>

<p>The three-dimensional velocity structure of the shock-heated Si-reach and S-reach ejecta were reconstructed in Tycho supernova remnant from Doppler-shifted lines. The vector components along the line of sight were restored from the spatially resolved spectral analysis of the Doppler shifts of Si XIII and S XV lines. The components in the plane of the sky were derived from analysis of the proper motion of the remnantâs edge at different azimuths. This has been done by using the data of X-ray observations from Chandra observatory as well as the radio data from the Very Large Array.   Differences in Doppler velocities over the Tychoâs SNR are of the order of thousands of km/s. The speed of the ejecta on the opposite sides of the remnant as a three-dimensional object differs on 20-30%. There are asymmetries and differences in the spatial distributions between the Si-reach and S-reach ejecta components. Namely, the level of isotropy is higher in Si while the vector components directed outward of the observer are larger in S. This puts limitations on the level of deviation of the internal structure of the progenitor star from the ideal layered structure as well as on the level of asymmetries in supernova explosion.</p>

<p>2024-12-05, <strong>The puzzling long GRB 191019A: Evidence for Kilonova Light</strong>, G. Stratta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04059v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.04059v1</a></p>

<p>GRB 191019A was a long Gamma-ray burst (GRB) lasting about 65 s and, as such, originally thought to be linked to a core-collapse supernova. However, even though follow-up observations identified the optical counterpart close to the bright nucleus of a nearby ancient galaxy (z=0.248), no associated supernova was found. This led to the suggestion that the burst was caused by the merger of two compact stellar objects, likely in a dense circumnuclear environment. By using a recently developed diagnostic tool based on prompt emission temporal properties, we noticed that GRB 191019A falls among those long GRBs which are associated with compact mergers and with evidence of kilonova light. We thus re-analyzed unpublished GROND multi-color (gârâiâzâJHK_s) data obtained between 0.4 and 15 days post trigger. Image subtraction confirmed the optical counterpart in all four optical bands, with GROND tracking its fading until 1.5 days post-burst. Incorporating publicly available Swift-XRT data, a joint fit of an afterglow plus a kilonova model revealed a better match than an afterglow-only scenario. The resulting kilonova properties resemble those of AT2017gfo associated with the binary neutron star merger GW170817, with a total ejected mass of about 0.06 solar mass. Contrary to previous findings inferring a high-density circumburst environment (n0=10^7-10^8 cm^-3), our analysis finds standard conditions (n0 = 1 cm^-3), suggesting the long duration of GRB 191019A was intrinsic rather than due to jet interaction with a dense external medium.</p>
