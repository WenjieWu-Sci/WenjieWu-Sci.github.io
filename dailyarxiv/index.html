<p>2024-09-11, <strong>Measuring the weak mixing angle at SBND</strong>, Gustavo F. S. Alves et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07430v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.07430v1</a></p>

<p>The weak mixing angle provides a sensitive test of the Standard Model. We study SBND’s sensitivity to the weak mixing angle using neutrino-electron scattering events. We perform a detailed simulation, paying particular attention to background rejection and estimating the detector response. We find that SBND can provide a reasonable constraint on the weak mixing angle, achieving 8% precision for $10^{21}$ protons on target, assuming an overall flux normalization uncertainty of 10%. This result is superior to those of current neutrino experiments and is relatively competitive with other low-energy measurements.</p>

<p>2024-09-11, <strong>How new physics affects primordial neutrinos decoupling: Direct Simulation Monte Carlo approach</strong>, Maksym Ovchynnikov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07378v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.07378v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmological observations from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) offer crucial insights into the Early Universe, enabling us to trace its evolution back to lifetimes as short as 0.01 seconds. Upcoming CMB spectrum measurements, such as those underway at the Simons Observatory, will achieve unprecedented precision, allowing for more accurate extraction of information about the properties of the primordial plasma and, in particular, primordial neutrinos. This provides an opportunity to test whether these properties align with the predictions of the standard cosmological model or indicate the presence of new physics that influenced the evolution of the MeV-temperature plasma. A key component in understanding how new physics may have affected primordial neutrinos is solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation. In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving this equation that offers model independence, transparency, and computational efficiency - features that current state-of-the-art methods lack. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept implementation and apply it to several toy scenarios, showcasing key aspects of the primordial plasma’s evolution in the presence of new physics.</p>

<p>2024-09-11, <strong>Muon anomalous magnetic moment and Right handed sterile neutrino</strong>, Iman Motie et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07184v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.07184v1</a></p>

<p>The muon’s magnetic moment is a fundamental quantity in particle physics and the deviation of its value from quantum electrodynamics (QED), motivates research beyond the standard models (SM). In this study, we utilize the effective coupling of right-handed sterile neutrinos with SM gauge bosons to calculate the muon anomalous magnetic moment ($\boldsymbol{\mu}$AMM) at one-loop level. The contribution of the sterile neutrino interactions on the $\boldsymbol{\mu}$AMM is calculated by considering the standard and non-standard neutrino interactions. Our results show that the standard sterile neutrino interactions give a negligible contribution to $\Delta a_{\boldsymbol{\mu}}$ while the non-standard neutrino interactions can play a significant role in explaining the muon $(g-2)$ anomaly. In the context of the non-standard neutrino interaction, our calculation shows that a Dirac mass scale $M_D$ around $100\,\text{GeV}$ could explain the muon anomaly if the right handed sterile neutrino’s coupling with SM particles is about $\mathcal{G}_R\approx 10^{-3}$. We have also plotted the allowed region of the model parameters that satisfy the experimental data on $\Delta a_}^{SN}$ and discuss the percentage of the ${\boldsymbol{\mu}}$ anomaly compensation in terms of the coupling constant $\mathcal{G}_R$.</p>

<p>2024-09-11, <strong>Finite Energy Resolution, Correlations Between Bins and Non-Nested Hypotheses</strong>, Emilio Ciuffoli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07157v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.07157v1</a></p>

<p>We show that whenever independent events are binned, there is no correlation between bins. In particular, neither the uncertainty in the energy resolution nor a systematic error in the energy response of a detector will lead to a correlation between bins. This is in contrast with a result that recently appeared in the literature, where it was claimed that the finite energy resolution could induce correlation between bins, changing the distribution of $\Delta\chi^2$ when attempting to determine the neutrino mass ordering using reactor neutrinos. We will compute the expression for the variance of $\Delta\chi^2$ in the case of non-nested hypotheses if correlations between bins are present, showing that they could indeed affect the distribution. We will also show, however, that the detector response cannot introduce statistical correlations between bins unless these are already present in the original spectrum. Both of these results are valid in general: the absence of correlation is true for any detector response and the distribution of $\Delta\chi^2$ in the presence of (intrinsic) correlations, while obtained having the mass ordering in mind, it is true for any non-nested hypotheses.</p>

<p>The proceeding gives a summary of the experimental results presented at the Moriond 2024 conference (electroweak interactions and unified theory session), focussing on the latest measurements. A variety of topics were covered in the various sessions of the conference including H boson properties, measurements in the electroweak and top quark sectors, flavour and neutrino physics, searches for dark matter and physics beyond the standard model, as well as astroparticle and precision physics.</p>

<p>The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) is a proposed dual-satellite mission to observe Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs), increasing the statistics at the highest energies, and Very-High-Energy Neutrinos (VHENs), following multi-messenger alerts of astrophysical transient events throughout the universe such as gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave events. POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a scaled-down version of the POEMMA design, adapted to be flown as a payload on one of NASA’s sub-orbital Super Pressure Balloons (SPBs) circling over the Southern Ocean for up to 100 days after a launch from Wanaka, New Zealand. This overview will provide a summary of the mission with its science goals, the instruments, and the current status of PBR.</p>

<p>2024-09-10, <strong>Cogenesis of visible and dark matter in a scotogenic model</strong>, Debajit Bose et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06541v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.06541v1</a></p>

<p>Within a scotogenic neutrino mass model we explore the cogenesis of matter from the CP violating decay of a heavy $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd right handed neutrino that simultaneously populates the visible and a multipartite dark sector. The quantum of CP violation sets the baryon asymmetry in the visible sector driven by leptogenesis. The relic density of a sub-GeV scale freeze-in dark matter is generated by the late time decay of the next to lightest dark particle dynamically regulated by its interplay with the thermal scattering processes.</p>

<p>2024-09-10, <strong>Scoto-seesaw model implied by flavor-dependent Abelian gauge charge</strong>, Duong Van Loi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06393v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.06393v1</a></p>

<p>Assuming fundamental fermions possess a new Abelian gauge charge that depends on flavors of both quark and lepton, we obtain a simple extension of the Standard Model, which reveals some new physics insights. The new gauge charge anomaly cancellation not only explains the existence of just three fermion generations as observed but also requires the presence of a unique right-handed neutrino $\nu_R$ with a non-zero new gauge charge. Further, the new gauge charge breaking supplies a residual matter parity, under which the fundamental fermions and $\nu_R$ are even, whereas a right-handed neutrino $N_R$ without the new charge is odd. Consequently, light neutrino masses in our model are generated from the tree-level type-I seesaw mechanism induced by $\nu_R$ and from the one-loop scotogenic contribution accommodated by potential dark matter candidates, $N_R$ and dark scalars, odd under the matter parity. We examine new physics phenomena related to the additional gauge boson, which could be observed at colliders. We analyze the constraints imposed on our model by current experimental limits on neutrino masses, neutral meson oscillations, $B$-meson decays, and charged lepton flavor violating processes. We also investigate the potential dark matter candidates by considering relic density and direct detection.</p>

<p>2024-09-11, <strong>Effects of Dark Matter on the Spontaneous Scalarization in Neutron Stars</strong>, Fahimeh Rahimi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07328v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.07328v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter, an important portion of compact objects, can influence different phenomena in neutron stars. The spontaneous scalarization in the scalar-tensor gravity has been proposed for neutron stars. Here, we investigate the spontaneous scalarization in dark matter admixed neutron stars. Applying the dark matter equations of state, we calculate the structure of scalarized neutron stars containing dark matter. The dark matter equations of state are based on observational data from the rotational curves of galaxies and the fermionic self-interacting dark matter. Our results verify that the spontaneous scalarization is affected by the dark matter pressure in neutron stars. Depending on the central density of scalarized dark matter admixed neutron stars, the dark matter pressure alters the central scalar field. The increase of dark matter pressure in low-density scalarized stars amplifies the central scalar field. However, the pressure of dark matter in high-density scalarized stars suppresses the central scalar field. Our calculations confirm that the stars in the merger event GW170817 and in the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1820-30 can be scalarized dark matter admixed neutron stars.</p>

<p>2024-09-11, <strong>PSZ2 G282.28+49.94, a recently discovered analogue of the famous Bullet Cluster</strong>, I. Bartalucci et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07290v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.07290v1</a></p>

<p>We present a detailed study of the gas and galaxy properties of the cluster PSZ2 G282.28+49.94 detected in the Planck all-sky survey. The intracluster medium (ICM) of this object at z=0.56 exhibits a cometary-like shape. Combining Chandra and TNG observations, we characterised the spatially resolved thermodynamical properties of the gas and the spatial and velocity distribution of 73 galaxy members. The cluster structure is quite complex with an elongated core region containing the two brightest cluster galaxies and one dense group to the south-east. Since there is no velocity difference between the core and the south-east group, we suggest the presence of a merger along the plane of the sky. This structure is related to complex X-ray and radio features, and thus the merger has likely been caught during the post-merger phase. Comparing the distribution of the ICM and of member galaxies, we find a large offset of $\sim 350$ kpc between the position of the X-ray peak and the centre of a concentration of galaxies, preceding it in the likely direction of motion. This configuration is similar to the famous Bullet Cluster, leading us to dub PSZ2 G282.28+49.94 the “Planck bullet”, and represents an ideal situation to provide astrophysical constraints to the self-interaction cross-section ($\sigma/m$) of dark matter particles. These results illustrate the power of a multi-wavelength approach to probe the merging scenario of such complex and distant systems.</p>

<p>2024-09-10, <strong>Non-Canonical Dark Energy Parameter Evolution in a Canonical Quintessence Cosmology</strong>, Rodger I. Thompson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06792v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.06792v1</a></p>

<p>This study considers the specific case of a flat, minimally coupled to gravity, quintessence cosmology with a dark energy quartic polynomial potential that has the same mathematical form as the Higgs potential. Previous work on this case determined that the scalar field is given by a simple expression of the Lambert W function in terms of the easily observable scale factor. This expression provides analytic equations for the evolution of cosmological dark energy parameters as a function of the scale factor for all points on the Lambert W function principal branch. The Lambert W function is zero at a scale factor of zero that marks the big bang. The evolutionary equations beyond the big bang describe a canonical universe that is similar to {\Lambda}CDM, making it an excellent dynamical template to compare with observational data. The portion of the W function principal before the big bang extends to the infinite pre-bang past. It describes a noncanonical universe with an initially very low mass density that contracts by rolling down the dark energy potential to a singularity, big bang, at the scale factor zero point. This provides a natural origin for the big bang. It also raises the possibility that the universe existed before the big bang and is far older, and that it was once far larger than its current size. The recent increasing interest in the possibility of a dynamical universe instead of {\Lambda}CDM makes the exploration of the nature of such universes particularly relevant.</p>

<p>2024-09-10, <strong>Supermassive black hole feedback quenches disc galaxies and suppresses bar formation in TNG50</strong>, Matthew Frosst et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06783v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.06783v1</a></p>

<p>We use the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 to study the relationship between black hole feedback, the presence of stellar bars, and star formation quenching in Milky Way-like disc galaxies. Of our sample of 198 discs, about 63 per cent develop stellar bars that last until z=0. After the formation of their bars, the majority of these galaxies develop persistent 3-15 kpc wide holes in the centres of their gas discs. Tracking their evolution from z=4 to 0, we demonstrate that barred galaxies tend to form within dark matter haloes that become centrally disc dominated early on (and are thus unstable to bar formation) whereas unbarred galaxies do not; barred galaxies also host central black holes that grow more rapidly than those of unbarred galaxies. As a result, most barred galaxies eventually experience kinetic wind feedback that operates when the mass of the central supermassive black hole exceeds $M_{BH} &gt; 10^8 M_{\odot}$. This feedback ejects gas from the central disc into the circumgalactic medium and rapidly quenches barred galaxies of their central star formation. If kinetic black hole feedback occurs in an unbarred disc it suppresses subsequent star formation and inhibits its growth, stabilising the disc against future bar formation. Consequently, most barred galaxies develop black hole-driven gas holes, though a gas hole alone does not guarantee the presence of a stellar bar. This subtle relationship between black hole feedback, cold gas disc morphology, and stellar bars may provide constraints on subgrid physics models for supermassive black hole feedback.</p>

<p>2024-09-10, <strong>Searching for Dark Matter Interactions with ACT, SPT and DES</strong>, Zilu Zhou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06771v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.06771v1</a></p>

<p>Models of a dark radiation sector with a mass threshold (WZDR+) have proved to be an appealing alternative to $\Lambda$CDM. These models provide simple comparison models, grounded in well-understood particle physics and with limited additional parameters. In addition, they have shown relevance in easing existing cosmological tensions, specifically the $H_0$ tension and the $S_8$ tension. Recently, measurements of CMB lensing by the ACT collaboration have provided strong additional information on clustering at late times. Within $\Lambda$CDM, these results yield a high value of $S_8$ at odds with weak-lensing measurements. In this work, we study this in the context of WZDR+, and find a much wider range of allowed values of $S_8$, and in particular much better agreement between data sets and an overall improvement of fit versus $\Lambda$CDM. We expand our analyses to include a wide set of data, including the ACT-DR6 lensing data, as well as primary CMB information from ACT-DR4 and SPT-3G, scale-dependent power spectra from DES and measurements of $H_0$ from SH0ES. We find that there is little to no tension in measurements of structure within the data sets, and the inferred value of $S_8$ is generally lower than that in $\Lambda$CDM. We find that the inclusion of DES generally favors a higher $H_0$, but there is some direct tension between the high-$\ell$ multipole data and this result. Future data should clarify whether this is a statistical artifact, or a true incompatibility of these datasets within this model.</p>

<p>2024-09-10, <strong>MAMBO – An empirical galaxy and AGN mock catalogue for the exploitation of future surveys</strong>, X. López-López et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06700v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.06700v1</a></p>

<p>Aims. We present MAMBO, a flexible and efficient workflow to build empirical galaxy and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) mock catalogues that reproduce the physical and observational properties of these sources.   Methods. We start from simulated dark matter (DM) haloes, to preserve the link with the cosmic web, and we populate them with galaxies and AGN using abundance matching techniques. We follow an empirical methodology, using stellar mass functions (SMF), host galaxy AGN mass functions and AGN accretion rate distribution functions studied at different redshifts to assign, among other properties, stellar masses, the fraction of quenched galaxies, or the AGN activity (demography, obscuration, multiwavelength emission, etc.).   Results. As a proof test, we apply the method to a Millennium DM lightcone of 3.14 $\rm deg^2$ up to redshift $z=10$ and down to stellar masses $\mathcal{M} \gtrsim 10^{7.5} \, M_\odot$. We show that the AGN population from the mock lightcone here presented reproduces with good accuracy various observables, such as state-of-the-art luminosity functions in the X-ray up to $z \sim 7$ and in the ultraviolet up to $z \sim 5$, optical/NIR colour-colour diagrams, and narrow emission line diagnostic diagrams. Finally, we demonstrate how this catalogue can be used to make useful predictions for large surveys. Using \textit{Euclid} as a case example, we compute, among other forecasts, the expected surface densities of galaxies and AGN detectable in the \textit{Euclid} $H_{\rm E}$ band. We find that \textit{Euclid} might observe (on $H_{\rm E}$ only) about $10^{7}$ and $8 \times 10^{7}$ Type 1 and 2 AGN respectively, and $2 \times 10^{9}$ galaxies at the end of its 14 679 $\rm deg^2$ Wide survey, in good agreement with other published forecasts.</p>

<p>2024-09-10, <strong>Hierarchical Bayesian inference on an analytical model of the LISA massive black hole binary population</strong>, Vivienne Langen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06527v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.06527v1</a></p>

<p>Massive black hole binary (MBHB) mergers will be detectable in large numbers by the Lisa Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), which will thus provide new insights on how they form via repeated dark matter (DM) halo and galaxy mergers. Here we present a simple analytical model to generate a population of MBHB mergers based on a theoretical prescription that connects them to DM halo mergers. The high flexibility of our approach allows us to explore the broad and uncertain range of MBH seeding and growth mechanisms, as well as the different effects behind the interplay between MBH and galactic astrophysics. Such a flexibility is fundamental for the successful implementation and optimisation of the hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation approach that here we apply to the MBHB population of LISA for the first time. Our inferred population hyper-parameters are chosen as proxies to characterise the MBH–DM halo mass scaling relation, the occupation fraction of MBHs in DM halos and the delay between halo and MBHB mergers. We find that LISA will provide tight constraints at the lower-end of the MBH-halo scaling relation, well complementing EM observations which are biased towards large masses. Furthermore, our results suggest that LISA will constrain some features of the MBH occupation fraction at high redshift, as well as merger time delays of the order of a few hundreds of Myr, opening the possibility to constrain dynamical evolution time scales such as the dynamical friction. The analysis presented here constitutes a first attempt at developing a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach to the LISA MBHB population, opening the way for several further improvements and investigations.</p>

<p>2024-09-10, <strong>Dielectric Haloscopes as Gravitational Wave Detectors</strong>, Valerie Domcke et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06462v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.06462v1</a></p>

<p>We argue that dielectric haloscopes like MADMAX, originally designed for detecting axion dark matter, are also very promising gravitational wave detectors. Operated in resonant mode at frequencies around $\mathcal{O}(10\,\text{GHz})$, these detectors benefit from enhanced gravitational wave to photon conversion at the surfaces of a stack of thin dielectric disks. Since the gravitational wave is relativistic, there is an additional enhancement of the signal compared to the axion case due to increased conversion probability of gravitational waves to photons in the vacuum between the disks. A gravitational wave search using a dielectric haloscope imposes stringent requirements on the disk thickness and placement, but relaxed requirements on the disk smoothness. An advantage is the possibility of a broadband or hybrid resonant/broadband operation mode, which extends the frequency range down to $\mathcal{O}(100\,\text{MHz})$. We show that strain sensitivities down to $10^{-21} \text{Hz}^{-1/2} \times (10\,\text{GHz}/f)$ will be possible in the coming years for the broadband setup, while a resonant setup optimized for gravitational waves could even reach $3\times 10^{-23} \text{Hz}^{-1/2} \times (10\,\text{GHz}/f)$ with current technology.</p>

<p>Quantum evaporation of a black hole is conventionally studied semiclassically by assuming self-similarity of the black hole throughout the evaporation process. However, its validity was recently questioned, and the lifetime of a black hole is conjectured to be much extended by the memory burden effect. It gives rise to the possibility that the primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $10^{10}$ grams are the dark matter in the Universe. To probe such PBH dark matter, we study gravitational waves (GWs) induced by primordial curvature perturbations that produced the PBHs. We find $\Omega_\text{GW}(f_\text{peak})h^2 = 7 \times 10^{-9}$ with the peak frequency $f_\text{peak} = 1\times 10^{3} \, (M_\text{PBH}/(10^{10}\,\mathrm{g}))^{-1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}$, and the induced GWs associated with the PBH dark matter whose initial mass is greater than about $10^7$ grams can be tested by future observations such as Cosmic Explorer. Furthermore, the scenario can be in principle confirmed by detecting another GW signal from the mergers of PBHs, which leads to high-frequency GWs with $f_\text{peak} = 2 \times 10^{27}\, (M_\text{PBH, ini}/(10^{10}\, \mathrm{g}))^{-1} \, \mathrm{Hz} $. On the other hand, the induced GW signals stronger than expected would contradict the dark matter abundance and exclude the memory burden effect.</p>

<p>We explore the co-evolution of dark matter halos, their central galaxies, and central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) using the IllustrisTNG (TNG) simulation. We find that the evolutionary histories of individual galaxies in the $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ plane can be decomposed into four distinct phases, separated by three transition points. We identify the driving processes of galaxy evolution within each phase and derive the conditions necessary and sufficient for transitions to subsequent phases. The first phase is dominated by star formation, with its duration primarily determined by the mass of the SMBH seed and the surrounding gas environment. The second phase is characterized by rapid SMBH growth, and the transition to the next phase occurs when the thermal-mode feedback of active galactic nucleus (AGN) can unbind gas from the galaxy. The third phase involves self-regulation of the SMBH, and the transition to the quenched phase occurs when the kinetic-mode feedback of AGN counterbalances gas cooling within the subhalo. The final phase is dominated by mergers. We investigate the use of scaling relations among different mass components and evolutionary phases to understand processes implemented in TNG and other simulations, and discuss how current and forthcoming observations can be used to constrain models.</p>

<p>We update and extend a previous model by Higdon and Lingenfelter for the longitudinal profile of the N\,II intensity in the Galactic plane. The model is based on four logarithmic spiral arms, to which features like the Local Arm and local sources are added. Connecting then the N\,II to the H\,II emission, we use this model to determine the average spatial distribution of OBassociations in the Milky Way. Combined with a stellar mass and cluster distribution function, the model predicts the average spatial and temporal distribution of core-collapse supernovae in the Milky Way. In addition to this average population, we account for supernovae from observed OB associations, providing thereby a more accurate description of the nearby Galaxy. The complete model is made publicly available in the python code SNOB.</p>

<p>The compact object with a mass of $2.50-2.67~M_\odot$ observed by LIGO Scientific and Virgo collaborations in GW190814, as well as the recent report of a light compact object with a mass and radius of $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}M_{\odot}$ and $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, have posed a great challenge to the investigations into the supranuclear matter. In the inner core region of the neutron star, the strangeness degrees of freedom, such as the hyperons, can be present, which is also named as a hyperonic star. In this work, the neutron star consisting of nucleons and leptons, and the hyperonic star including the hyperons will be studied in the framework of the density-dependent relativistic mean-field (DDRMF) model. Some popular DDRMF parameterizations will be adopted to investigate the properties of nuclear matter and the mass, radius, tidal deformability, and other properties of neutron star and hyperonic stars. We find that the maximum masses of neutron star calculated by DD-MEX, DD-MEX1, DD-MEX2, DD-MEXY and DD-LZ1 sets can be around $2.5-2.6~M_\odot$ with quite stiff equations of state (EOSs) generated by their strong repulsive contributions from vector potentials at high densities. Moreover, by investigating the influence of the crust EOS and core EOS on the neutron stars, we find that the observational data from HESS J1731-347 suggest the requirement of a crust EOS with a higher $L$ parameter and a core EOS with a lower $L$ parameter, and the $M-R$ relations from the constructed EOSs can also be consistent with the observables of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451 from NICER and the GW170817 event. With the inclusion of hyperons, the hyperonic star matter becomes softer compared to the neutron star matter. But the massive hyperonic star can also be obtained with DDRMF parameter sets if the vector coupling constants are strong.</p>

<p>2024-09-10, <strong>Discovery of young, oxygen-rich supernova remnants in PHANGS-MUSE galaxies</strong>, Timo Kravtsov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06504v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.06504v1</a></p>

<p>Context. Supernova remnants (SNRs) are the late stages of supernovae before their merging into the surrounding medium. Oxygen-rich supernova remnants represent a rare subtype with strong visible light oxygen emission. Aims. We present a new method to detect SNRs exploiting the capabilities of modern visible-light integral-field units based on the shapes of the SNR emission lines. Methods. We search for unresolved shocked regions with broadened emission lines using the medium-resolution integral-field spectrograph MUSE on the Very Large Telescope. The spectral resolving power allows shocked emission sources to be differentiated from photoionised sources based on the linewidths. Results. We find 307 supernova remnants, including seven O-rich SNRs. For all O-rich SNRs, we observe the [O III]{\lambda}{\lambda}4959,5007 emission doublet. In addition, we observe emissions from [O I]{\lambda}{\lambda}6300,6364, [O II]{\lambda}{\lambda}7320,7330, H{\alpha}+[N II]{\lambda}6583 and [S II]{\lambda}{\lambda}6717,6731 to varying degrees. The linewidths for the O-rich SNRs are generally broader than the rest of the SNRs in the sample of this article. The oxygen emission complexes are reminiscient of SNR 4449-1 and some long-lasting SNe. For the O-rich SNRs, we also search for counterparts in archival data of other telescopes; we detect X-ray and mid-IR counterparts for a number of remnants. Conclusions. We have shown efficacy of the method to detect SNRs presented in this article. In addition, the method is also effective in detecting the rare O-rich SNRs, doubling the sample size in the literature. The origin of O-rich SNRs and their link to specific SN types or environments is still unclear, but further work into this new sample will unquestionably help us shed light on these rare remnants.</p>

<p>2024-09-10, <strong>Sifting the debris: Patterns in the SNR population with unsupervised ML methods</strong>, F. Bufano et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06383v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.06383v1</a></p>

<p>Supernova remnants (SNRs) carry vast amounts of mechanical and radiative energy that heavily influence the structural, dynamical, and chemical evolution of galaxies. To this day, more than 300 SNRs have been discovered in the Milky Way, exhibiting a wide variety of observational features. However, existing classification schemes are mainly based on their radio morphology. In this work, we introduce a novel unsupervised deep learning pipeline to analyse a representative subsample of the Galactic SNR population ($\sim$ 50% of the total) with the aim of finding a connection between their multi-wavelength features and their physical properties. The pipeline involves two stages: (1) a representation learning stage, consisting of a convolutional autoencoder that feeds on imagery from infrared and radio continuum surveys (WISE 22$\mu$m, Hi-GAL 70 $\mu$m and SMGPS 30 cm) and produces a compact representation in a lower-dimensionality latent space; and (2) a clustering stage that seeks meaningful clusters in the latent space that can be linked to the physical properties of the SNRs and their surroundings. Our results suggest that this approach, when combined with an intermediate uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) reprojection of the autoencoded embeddings into a more clusterable manifold, enables us to find reliable clusters. Despite a large number of sources being classified as outliers, most clusters relate to the presence of distinctive features, such as the distribution of infrared emission, the presence of radio shells and pulsar wind nebulae, and the existence of dust filaments.</p>

<p>2024-09-10, <strong>A potential mass-gap black hole in a wide binary with a circular orbit</strong>, Wang Song et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06352v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2409.06352v1</a></p>

<p>Mass distribution of black holes identified through X-ray emission suggests a paucity of black holes in the mass range of 3 to 5 solar masses. Modified theories have been devised to explain this mass gap, and it is suggested that natal kicks during supernova explosion can more easily disrupt binaries with lower mass black holes. Although recent LIGO observations reveal the existence of compact remnants within this mass gap, the question of whether low-mass black holes can exist in binaries remains a matter of debate. Such a system is expected to be noninteracting without X-ray emission, and can be searched for using radial velocity and astrometric methods. Here we report Gaia DR3 3425577610762832384, a wide binary system including a red giant star and an unseen object, exhibiting an orbital period of approximately 880 days and near-zero eccentricity. Through the combination of radial velocity measurements from LAMOST and astrometric data from Gaia DR2 and DR3 catalogs, we determine a mass of $3.6^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$ $M_{\odot}$ of the unseen component. This places the unseen companion within the mass gap, strongly suggesting the existence of binary systems containing low-mass black holes. More notably, the formation of its surprisingly wide circular orbit challenges current binary evolution and supernova explosion theories.</p>
