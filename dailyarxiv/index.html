<p>2023-05-31, <strong>New Physics in Neutrino Oscillation: Nonunitarity or Nonorthogonality?</strong>, Chee Sheng Fong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19755v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19755v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino oscillation phenomenon is a definite evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) and high precision measurement of neutrino properties will certainly give us clue about what lies beyond the SM. In particular, precise measurements of the mixing matrix elements $U_{\alpha i}$ which relate the neutrino flavor $\alpha$ and mass $i$ eigenstates are crucial since new physics at scale beyond experimental reach can lead to a nonunitary $U$. This in turns results in nonorthogonal neutrino flavor states. How to calculate the oscillation probability in this scenario is an important theoretical issue that will be treated here. We show that probability constructed using theory of projection probability will ensure that the theory remains unitary in time evolution and the probabilities of neutrino of certain flavor being detected as all possible flavor states always sum up to unity. This result is crucial for discovery of new physics through neutrino oscillation phenomena.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>Measurement of the inclusive electron-neutrino charged-current cross section on ${}^{127}$I with the COHERENT NaI$ν$E detector</strong>, P. An et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19594v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19594v1</a></p>

<p>Using an 185-kg NaI[Tl] array, COHERENT has measured the inclusive electron-neutrino charged-current cross section on ${}^{127}$I with neutrinos produced by the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Iodine is one the heaviest targets for which low-energy ($\leq 50$ MeV) inelastic neutrino-nucleus processes have been measured, and this is the first measurement of its inclusive cross section. After a five-year detector exposure, COHERENT reports a flux-averaged cross section for electron neutrinos produced at a pion decay-at-rest source of $9.2^{+2.1}_{-1.8}\times10^{-40}$ cm$^2$. This corresponds to a value that is $\sim$41% lower than predicted using the MARLEY event generator with a measured Gamow-Teller strength distribution. In addition, the observed visible spectrum from charged-current scattering on ${}^{127}$I has been measured between 10 and 55 MeV, and the exclusive zero-neutron and one-or-more-neutron emission cross sections are measured to be $5.12_{-3.1}^{+3.4} \times 10^{-40}\mbox{ cm}^2$ and $2.2_{-0.5}^{+0.4} \times 10^{-40}\mbox{ cm}^2$, respectively.</p>

<p>It is shown that the solution for $B-L$ gauge symmetry with $B-L=-4,-4,+5$ assigned for three right-handed neutrinos respectively, reveals a novel scotogenic mechanism with implied matter parity for neutrino mass generation and dark matter stability. Additionally, the world with two-component dark matter is hinted.</p>

<p>2023-05-30, <strong>A neural network emulator for the Lyman-$α$ 1D flux power spectrum</strong>, Laura Cabayol-Garcia et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19064v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19064v1</a></p>

<p>The Lyman-$\alpha$ offers a unique avenue for studying the distribution of matter in the high redshift universe and extracting precise constraints on the nature of dark matter, neutrino masses, and other $\Lambda$CDM extensions. However, interpreting this observable requires accurate modelling of the thermal and ionisation state of the intergalactic medium, and therefore resorting to computationally expensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this work, we build a neural network that serves as a surrogate model for rapid predictions of the one-dimensional \lya flux power spectrum ($P_{\rm 1D}$), thereby making Bayesian inference feasible for this observable. Our emulation technique is based on modelling $P_{\rm 1D}$ as a function of the slope and amplitude of the linear matter power spectrum rather than as a function of cosmological parameters. We show that our emulator achieves sub-percent precision across the full range of scales ($k_{\parallel }=0.1$ to 4Mpc$^{-1}$) and redshifts ($z=2$ to 4.5) considered, and also for three $\Lambda$CDM extensions not included in the training set: massive neutrinos, running of the spectral index, and curvature. Furthermore, we show that it performs at the 1% level for ionisation and thermal histories not present in the training set and performs at the percent level when emulating down to $k_{\parallel}$=8Mpc$^{-1}$. These results affirm the efficacy of our emulation strategy in providing accurate predictions even for cosmologies and reionisation histories that were not explicitly incorporated during the training phase, and we expect it to play a critical role in the cosmological analysis of the DESI survey.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures of a Fuzzy Dark Matter Universe</strong>, Hamed Manouchehri Kousha et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20075v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.20075v1</a></p>

<p>Ultra-light scalar fields and their non-interacting class, the so-called fuzzy dark matter (FDM), are candidates for dark matter, introduced to solve the small-scale problems of the standard cold dark matter. In this paper, we address whether the small-scale effects, specifically the quantum pressure, could leave sizable imprints on the large-scale statistics of the matter. For this purpose, We utilize the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFT of LSS) wherein small-scale physics is integrated and represented on large scales by only a set of free parameters. These parameters can be determined by fitting to the cosmological simulations. We use the \textit{Gadget-2} code to study the evolution of $512^3$ particles in a box of side length $250\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. Fitting EFT predictions to the simulation data, we determine the value of the speed of sound. We use the suppressed FDM initial conditions for the FDM case, sufficient to produce accurate – enough for our purpose – results on large scales. We perform three FDM simulations with different masses and compare their sound speed with the standard cold dark matter (CDM) simulation. We found that the FDM sound speed is slightly higher than CDM’s. The deviation of the sound speed for FDM from CDM is larger for lower FDM masses. We conclude that the impact of the FDM is not limited to the small scales alone, and we can search for them by studying the matter on large scales. Though it is beyond the observations’ scope today, it is possible to discriminate it with upcoming observations.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>Dark Matter Detection with Strongly Correlated Topological Materials: Flatband Effect</strong>, Zhao Huang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19967v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19967v1</a></p>

<p>Dirac materials have been proposed as a new class of electron-based detectors for light dark-matter (DM) scattering or absorption, with predicted sensitivities far exceeding superconductors and superfluid helium. The superiority of Dirac materials originates from a significantly reduced in-medium dielectric response winning over the suppression of DM scattering owing to the limited phase space at the point-like Fermi surface. Here we propose a new route to enhance significantly the DM detection efficiency via strongly correlated topological semimetals. Specifically, by considering a strongly correlated Weyl semimetal model system, we demonstrate that the strong correlation-induced flatband effects can amplify the coupling and detection sensitivity to light DM particles by expanding the scattering phase space, while maintaining a weak dielectric in-medium response.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>Too small to fail: assessing the measurability of sub-solar mass compact object mergers</strong>, Noah E. Wolfe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19907v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19907v1</a></p>

<p>The detection of a sub-solar mass black hole could yield dramatic new insights into the nature of dark matter and early-Universe physics, as such objects lack a traditional astrophysical formation mechanism. Gravitational waves allow for the direct measurement of compact object masses during binary mergers, and we expect the gravitational-wave signal from a low-mass coalescence to remain within the LIGO frequency band for thousands of seconds. However, it is unclear whether one can confidently measure the properties of a sub-solar mass compact object and distinguish between a sub-solar mass black hole or other exotic objects. To this end, we perform Bayesian parameter estimation on simulated gravitational-wave signals from sub-solar mass black hole mergers to explore the measurability of their source properties. We find that the LIGO/Virgo detectors during the O4 observing run would be able to confidently identify sub-solar component masses at the threshold of detectability; these events would also be well-localized on the sky and may reveal some information on their binary spin geometry. Further, next-generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope will allow for precision measurement of the properties of sub-solar mass mergers and tighter constraints on their compact-object nature.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>Axion Topology in Photonic Crystal Domain Walls</strong>, Chiara Devescovi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19805v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19805v1</a></p>

<p>Axion insulators are 3D magnetic higher-order topological insulators protected by inversion-symmetry that exhibit hinge-localized chiral channels and induce quantized topological magnetoelectric effects. Recent research has suggested that axion insulators may be capable of detecting dark-matter axion-like particles by coupling to their axionic excitations. Beyond its fundamental theoretical interest, designing a photonic AXI offers the potential to enable the development of magnetically-tunable photonic switch devices through the manipulation of the axionic modes and their chiral propagation using external magnetic fields. Motivated by these facts, in this work, we propose a novel approach to induce axionic band topology in gyrotropic 3D Weyl photonic crystals gapped by supercell modulation. To quantize an axionic angle, we create domain-walls across inversion-symmetric photonic crystals, incorporating a phase-obstruction in the supercell modulation of their dielectric elements. This allows us to bind chiral channels on inversion-related hinges, ultimately leading to the realization of an axionic chiral channel of light. Moreover, by controlling the material gyrotropic response, we demonstrate a physically accessible way of manipulating the axionic modes through a small external magnetic bias, which provides an effective topological switch between different 1D chiral photonic fiber configurations. Remarkably, the unidirectional axionic hinge states supported by the photonic axion insulator are buried in a fully connected 3D dielectric structure, thereby being protected from radiation through the electromagnetic continuum. As a result, they are highly suitable for applications in guided-light communication, where the preservation and non-reciprocal propagation of photonic signals are of paramount importance.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>Determination of time-dependent electric dipole moments conditioned by axion-photon coupling</strong>, Alexander J. Silenko et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19703v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19703v1</a></p>

<p>It is shown that the axion-photon coupling leads to an appearance of time-dependent electric dipole moments of leptons and contributes to electric dipole moments of hadrons. The relation between these moments and the axion-photon coupling constant is rigorously determined. The results obtained open a possibility to compare a sensitivity of search for dark matter axions (and axion-like particles) in optical experiments and experiments with massive particles.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>Quasars: standard candles up to z=7.5 with the precision of Supernovae Ia</strong>, Maria Giovanna Dainotti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19668v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19668v1</a></p>

<p>Currently, the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model, which relies on the existence of cold dark matter and a cosmological constant $\Lambda$, best describes the Universe. However, we lack information in the high-redshift ($z$) region between Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) (up to $z=2.26$) and the Cosmic Microwave Background ($z=1100$), an interval crucial to test cosmological models and their possible evolution. We have defined a sample of 983 Quasars up to $z=7.54$ with reduced intrinsic dispersion $\delta=0.007$ which determines the matter density parameter $\Omega_M$ with the same precision of SNe Ia. Although previous analysis have been used Quasars as cosmological tools (e.g. Risaliti and Lusso 2019), this is the first time that high-redshift sources, in this case Quasars, as standalone cosmological probes yield such tight constraints on $\Omega_M$. Our results show the importance of correcting cosmological relationships for selection biases and redshift evolution and how the choice of a golden sample reduces considerably the intrinsic scatter. This proves the reliability of Quasars as standard cosmological candles.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>On the origin of the evolution of the halo occupation distribution</strong>, Sergio Contreras et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19628v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19628v1</a></p>

<p>We use the TNG300 magneto-hydrodynamic simulation and mock catalogues built using subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) to study the origin of the redshift evolution of the halo occupation distribution (HOD). We analyse stellar-mass selected galaxy samples with fixed number densities, spanning the redshift range $0 \le z \le 3$. We measure their halo occupation functions and fit the HOD parameters to study their evolution over cosmic time. The TNG300 galaxy population strongly depends on the baryonic physics implemented in the simulation. In contrast, the galaxy population predicted by a basic SHAM model without scatter is a direct result of the cosmology of the dark matter simulation. We find that the HOD evolution is similar for both models and is consistent with a previous study of the HOD evolution in semi-analytical models. Specifically, this is the case for the ratio between the characteristic halo masses for hosting central and satellite galaxies. The only HOD parameter whose evolution varies across models is $\sigma_{\rm logM}$, which contains information about the stellar mass-halo mass relation of the galaxies and does not strongly impact galaxy clustering. We also demonstrate that the dependence on the specific values of the cosmological parameters is small. We conclude that the cosmology of the galaxy sample, i.e. the cosmological hierarchical growth of structure, and not the baryonic physics prescriptions, governs the evolution of the HOD for stellar mass-selected samples. These results have important implications for populating simulated lightcones with galaxies and can facilitate the interpretation of clustering data at different redshifts.</p>

<p>2023-05-30, <strong>Investigation of Higgs Boson Decaying to Di-muon, Dark Matter Produced in Association with a Higgs Boson Decaying to $b$-quarks and Unbinned Profiled Unfolding</strong>, Jay Chan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19436v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19436v1</a></p>

<p>The discovery of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson by ATLAS and CMS at the LHC in 2012 marked a major milestone in particle physics. However, many questions remain unanswered, which has led to an active research program to search for either rare SM phenomena or Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics that involve the Higgs boson. In this dissertation, I present two example searches involving the Higgs boson, using proton-proton ($pp$) collision data collected by the ATLAS detector. The first search tackles the problem of how the SM Higgs couples to the second-generation fermions. It searches for the dimuon decay of the SM Higgs boson using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the ATLAS detector in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13\ \mathrm{TeV}$ at the LHC. In the second search, we look for Dark Matter produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to $b$-quarks. This search uses the same dataset as the $H\to\mu\mu$ search and targets events that contain large missing transverse momentum and either two $b$-tagged small-radius jets or a single large-radius jet associated with two $b$-tagged subjets. In addition to the two physics analyses, unfolding is a key procedure in the high energy experiments, which corrects data for the detector effect. I present a new unfolding method that allows to unfold data without having any artificial binning and is also able to profile nuisance parameters simultaneously. This new method provides much higher flexibility and increases the reusability for different downstream tasks compared to the traditional approach. It will benifit any future analyses including Higgs physics and Dark Matter searches.</p>

<p>2023-05-30, <strong>The Merian Survey: Design, Construction, and Characterization of a Filter Set Optimized to Find Dwarf Galaxies and Measure their Dark Matter Halo Properties with Weak Lensing</strong>, Yifei Luo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19310v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19310v1</a></p>

<p>The Merian survey is mapping $\sim$ 850 degrees$^2$ of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program (HSC-SSP) wide layer with two medium-band filters on the 4-meter Victor M. Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, with the goal of carrying the first high signal-to-noise (S/N) measurements of weak gravitational lensing around dwarf galaxies. This paper presents the design of the Merian filter set: N708 ($\lambda_c = 7080 \unicode{x212B}$, $\Delta\lambda = 275\unicode{x212B}$) and N540 ($\lambda_c = 5400\unicode{x212B}$, $\Delta\lambda = 210\unicode{x212B}$). The central wavelengths and filter widths of N708 and N540 were designed to detect the $\rm H\alpha$ and $\rm [OIII]$ emission lines of galaxies in the mass range $8&lt;\rm \log M_*/M_\odot&lt;9$ by comparing Merian fluxes with HSC broad-band fluxes. Our filter design takes into account the weak lensing S/N and photometric redshift performance. Our simulations predict that Merian will yield a sample of $\sim$ 85,000 star-forming dwarf galaxies with a photometric redshift accuracy of $\sigma_{\Delta z/(1+z)}\sim 0.01$ and an outlier fraction of $\eta=2.8\%$ over the redshift range $0.058&lt;z&lt;0.10$. With 60 full nights on the Blanco/Dark Energy Camera (DECam), the Merian survey is predicted to measure the average weak lensing profile around dwarf galaxies with lensing $\rm S/N \sim 32$ within $r&lt;0.5$ Mpc and lensing $\rm S/N \sim 90$ within $r&lt;1.0$ Mpc. This unprecedented sample of star-forming dwarf galaxies will allow for studies of the interplay between dark matter and stellar feedback and their roles in the evolution of dwarf galaxies.</p>

<p>2023-05-30, <strong>Unitarity, real-intermediate states, and fixed-order approach to resonant dark matter annihilation</strong>, Peter Maták et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19238v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19238v1</a></p>

<p>We study the role of perturbative unitarity in the resonant annihilation of two dark matter particles into the standard model bath. Systematically including all kinematically allowed holomorphic cuts of the corresponding forward-scattering diagram, cancellation of the singularities occurs, resulting in a fixed-order correction to the narrow-width approximation for the annihilation cross section. Unlike the standard approach based on including the finite width of the mediator, no double-counting of intermediate states occurs.</p>

<p>This work explores the dynamical stability of cosmological models where dark matter and dark energy can non-minimally couple to spacetime (scalar) curvature. Two different scenarios are presented here. In the initial case, only dark matter sector is coupled to curvature in the presence of a quintessence scalar field. In the second case both dark matter and the quintessence field are coupled to curvature. It is shown that one can get an accelerating expansion phase of the universe in both the cases. The nature of the fixed points show that there can be stable or unstable phases where the curvature coupling vanishes and dark energy and dark matter evolve independently. On the other hand there can be stable accelerating expansion phases where both the components are coupled to curvature.</p>

<p>The non-linear dynamics of scalar fields coupled to matter and gravity can lead to remarkable density-dependent screening effects. In this short review we present the main classes of screening mechanisms, and discuss their tests in laboratory and astrophysical systems. We particularly focus on reviewing numerical and technical aspects involved in modeling the non-linear dynamics of screening. In this review, we focus on tests using laboratory experiments and astrophysical systems, such as stars, galaxies and dark matter halos.</p>

<p>We study constraints on the hidden sector model mediated by an additional SU(2) Higgs doublet from the phenomenology of Higgs bosons. The hidden sector is assumed to contain a hidden U(1) gauge symmetry and the hidden U(1) gauge boson gets the mass by the electroweak symmetry breaking to be a dark Z boson. The Higgs sector of the model is similar to that of the two Higgs doublet model of type I except for the absence of the CP-odd scalar boson. Using the programs of HiggsBounds and HiggsSignals, we incorporate current experimental limits from LEP, Tevatron and LHC to examine the Higgs sector in our model and derive constraints on model parameters. We also discuss the implications of the model on the dark matter phenomenology.</p>

<p>In an axiverse with numerous axions, the cosmological moduli problem poses a significant challenge because the abundance of axions can easily exceed that of dark matter. The well-established stochastic axion scenario offers a simple solution, relying on relatively low-scale inflation. However, axions are typically subject to mixing due to mass and kinetic terms, which can influence the solution using stochastic dynamics. Focusing on the fact that the QCD axion has a temperature-dependent mass, unlike other axions, we investigate the dynamics of the QCD axion and another axion with mixing. We find that the QCD axion abundance is significantly enhanced and becomes larger than that of the other axion for a certain range of parameters. This enhancement widens the parameter regions accounting for dark matter. In addition, we also find a parameter region in which both axions have enhanced abundances of the same order, which result in multi-component dark matter.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>A standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant using GW170817 and the latest observations of the electromagnetic counterpart afterglow</strong>, A. Palmese et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19914v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19914v1</a></p>

<p>We present a new constraint on the Hubble constant $H_0$ using the latest measurements of the electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational wave (GW) event GW170817. We use the latest optical, X-ray and radio observations of the afterglow up to $\sim 3.5$ years after the GW detection, and properly take into account the impact of the host galaxy peculiar velocity. We find $75.46^{+5.34}_{-5.39}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (68\% Credible Interval), a $\sim7\%$ precision measurement, which is a significant improvement compared to the $14\%$ precision of the first standard siren measurement. Our result is consistent within $1\sigma$ with the Cepheid-anchored Supernova and within $1.5 \sigma$ with the Cosmic Microwave Background measurements of the Hubble constant. We also explore the impact of the various assumptions made when fitting for the afterglow on the Hubble constant estimate.</p>

<p>Currently, the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model, which relies on the existence of cold dark matter and a cosmological constant $\Lambda$, best describes the Universe. However, we lack information in the high-redshift ($z$) region between Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) (up to $z=2.26$) and the Cosmic Microwave Background ($z=1100$), an interval crucial to test cosmological models and their possible evolution. We have defined a sample of 983 Quasars up to $z=7.54$ with reduced intrinsic dispersion $\delta=0.007$ which determines the matter density parameter $\Omega_M$ with the same precision of SNe Ia. Although previous analysis have been used Quasars as cosmological tools (e.g. Risaliti and Lusso 2019), this is the first time that high-redshift sources, in this case Quasars, as standalone cosmological probes yield such tight constraints on $\Omega_M$. Our results show the importance of correcting cosmological relationships for selection biases and redshift evolution and how the choice of a golden sample reduces considerably the intrinsic scatter. This proves the reliability of Quasars as standard cosmological candles.</p>

<p>We establish a new and cosmological-model-independent method to explore the cosmic background dynamics in this work. Utilizing the latest Pantheon+ type Ia supernova sample and the Hubble parameter measurements, we obtain the values of the Hubble parameter and the deceleration parameter at five different redshift points ranging from 0.2 to 0.6, and find that they can deviate from the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model at more than $2\sigma$. We further probe the equation of state of dark energy and obtain that a slightly oscillating equation of state of dark energy around the $-1$ line is favored.</p>

<p>2023-05-30, <strong>Reversing the verdict: cataclysmic variables could be the dominant progenitors of AM CVn binaries after all</strong>, Diogo Belloni et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19312v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19312v1</a></p>

<p>Context. AM CVn binaries, that is, systems in which a white dwarf accretes matter from a helium-rich (semi-)degenerate object, are potential progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae and strong sources of persistent gravitational wave radiation. For a long time, it has been believed that these systems cannot descend from cataclysmic variables (CVs), at least not in large numbers, because the initial conditions need to be fine-tuned and, even worse, the resulting surface hydrogen abundance would be high enough to be detected which contradicts a defining feature of AM CVn binaries.   Aims. Here we show that both claimed weaknesses of the CV formation channel for AM CVn binaries are model-dependent and rely on poorly constrained assumptions for magnetic braking.   Methods. We performed binary evolution simulations with the MESA code for different combinations of post-common-envelope white dwarf and companion masses as well as orbital periods assuming strong magnetic braking.   Results. We found that AM CVn binaries with extremely-low surface hydrogen abundances are one natural outcome of CV evolution if the donor star has developed a non-negligible helium core prior to the onset of mass transfer. In this case, after hydrogen envelope exhaustion during CV evolution, the donor becomes degenerate and its surface hydrogen abundance substantially drops and becomes undetectable. Our simulations also show that the CV formation channel is able to explain the observed AM CVn binaries with very low mass and bloated donor stars (Gaia14aae and ZTF J1637+49) which has not been demonstrated for any alternative formation channel.   Conclusions. CVs with evolved donors are likely the progenitors of at least a fraction of AM CVn binaries.</p>

<p>2023-05-30, <strong>Sources of primary cosmic rays</strong>, S. E. Pyatovsky et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18792v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.18792v1</a></p>

<p>In the paper, a comparative primary cosmic rays (PCR) comparative analysis by $E_0$ and the spectra of variable stars by periods is carried out in order to establish the causes of irregularities in the spectrum of PCR by $E_0$. The study was performed using the public database of the KASCADE-Grande experiment and GCVS and ZTF variable star catalogues. It has been suggested that the acceleration of PCR to high and super-high energies occurs not only on the shock waves of supernovae, but also in bursts of giants and super-giants. The relationship between the periods of variable stars and the maximum energy $E_0$ of the nuclei of PCRs generated by these types of stars is shown. Irregularities in the PCR spectrum by $E_0$ are associated with the transition from one dominant stars type to another as $E_0$ increases. The knee in the PCR spectrum at $E_0~=~3-5~PeV$ is associated with a decrease in the contribution of SRB variability stars and a further increase in the contribution of Mira variable stars to the PCR flux. The bump in the PCR spectrum with a maximum at $E_0~=~80~PeV$, established in the KASCADE-Grande experiment, is formed by giant stars and super-giants of the Mira and SRC variability.</p>
