<p>2025-05-01, <strong>It’s All ${\tt Ok}$: Curvature in Light of BAO from DESI DR2</strong>, Shi-Fan Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00659v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.00659v1</a></p>

<p>Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) show hints of tension with data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) when interpreted within the standard model of cosmology. In this short note we discuss the consequences of one solution to this tension, a small but negative spatial curvature with $R_k = 21 H_0^{-1}$, which DESI measures at $2\sigma$. We describe the physical role of curvature in cosmological distance measures tied to recombination, i.e. the CMB and BAO, and the relation to neutrino mass constraints which are relaxed to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.10$ eV when curvature is allowed to deviate from zero. A robust detection of negative curvature would have significant implications for inflationary models: improved BAO measurements, particularly from future high-redshift spectroscopic surveys, will be able to distinguish curvature from other solutions to the DESI-CMB tension like phantom dark energy at high significance.</p>

<p>2025-05-01, <strong>First Measurement of the Electron Neutrino Charged-Current Pion Production Cross Section on Carbon with the T2K Near Detector</strong>, K. Abe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00516v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.00516v1</a></p>

<p>The T2K Collaboration presents the first measurement of electron neutrino-induced charged-current pion production on carbon in a restricted kinematical phase space. This is performed using data from the 2.5$^{\deg}$ off-axis near detector, ND280. The differential cross sections with respect to the outgoing electron and pion kinematics, in addition to the total flux-integrated cross section, are obtained. Comparisons between the measured and predicted cross section results using the Neut, Genie and NuWro Monte Carlo event generators are presented. The measured total flux-integrated cross section is [2.52 $\pm$ 0.52 (stat) $\pm$ 0.30 (sys)] x $10^{-39}$ cm$^2$ nucleon$^{-1}$, which is lower than the event generator predictions.</p>

<p>2025-05-01, <strong>Magnetized Accretion onto Neutron Stars: from Photon-trapped to Neutrino-cooled Flows</strong>, Luciano Combi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00300v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.00300v1</a></p>

<p>When a neutron star (NS) intercepts gas from a non-degenerate star, e.g., in a tidal disruption event, a common-envelope phase, or the collapsing core of a massive star, photons become trapped in the hot flow around the NS. This gas forms a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) until the density and temperature close to the NS surface grow large enough for binding energy to be converted to neutrinos. Here we present three-dimensional, general-relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion onto a non-rotating, unmagnetized NS. These connect, for the first time, an extended accretion disk with a self-consistent hydrostatic atmosphere around the star. The impact of different seed magnetic fields and accretion rates is studied by approximating the radiation-pressure dominated flow as an ideal gas with an adiabatic index of $4/3$, coupled to a variable neutrino emissivity. At low accretion rates, the hydrostatic atmosphere shows slow rotation and weak magnetization, transitioning to an outer RIAF structure. A toroidal magnetic field mediates the inward flow of energy and angular momentum through the atmosphere, which reaches a steady state when neutrino emission balances the accretion power. We develop a one-dimensional analytical model connecting these results with more general initial conditions and describing the main features of the flow. Our results have implications for the spin and mass evolution of hypercritically accreting NSs.</p>

<p>2025-04-30, <strong>Electroweak Observables in Neutrino-Electron Scattering from a Muon Storage Ring</strong>, André de Gouvêa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00152v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.00152v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the sensitivity of a companion neutrino detector situated in the plane of a high-energy, high-intensity muon storage ring to elastic $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu_e$ scattering on electrons (E$\nu$ES). Assuming a muon collider with center-of-mass energies of up to 10 TeV, we report sensitivity to the weak couplings $g_V$ and $g_A$ up to around 0.05% relative error, and sensitivity to the weak mixing angle in the momentum transfer $Q \in [10^{-2}, 2]$ GeV range up to around 0.03% relative error. E$\nu$ES measurements with high-energy muon storage rings allow one to directly interrogate the momentum transfer regime associated with the NuTeV anomaly. This level of precision allows unique sensitivity to the momentum-dependence of $\sin^2\theta_W$. We estimate that with the neutrinos from a $E_\mu = 1.5$ TeV (or higher) muon collider, the hypothesis that $\sin^2\theta_W$ does not “run” can be safely ruled out.</p>

<p>2025-04-30, <strong>Neutrino masses and mixed dark matter from doublet and singlet scalars</strong>, Jongkuk Kim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00121v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.00121v1</a></p>

<p>We consider the extension of the Standard Model with an inert scalar doublet, three right-handed neutrinos, and singlet scalar fields, $\varphi$ and $S$. In this model, neutrino masses are zero in the limit of the unbroken $Z_4$ discrete symmetry. We show that when the singlet scalar field $\varphi$ gets a VEV, the $Z_4$ symmetry is broken to $Z_2$, and neutrino masses are generated at one-loops due to the mixings between the neutral components of the inert scalar doublet and the singlet scalar field $S$. There is a dark matter candidate from the lightest neutral scalar field, which is a mixture of the inert scalar doublet and the singlet scalar field $S$, in general. The $Z_4$ breaking mass terms are constrained by electroweak precision data and direct detection (DD) bounds for dark matter, favoring small mixings or almost degenerate masses for the DM scalars. As a result, we discuss the implications of the results for small neutrino masses and DD-safe dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-04-30, <strong>On the difficulty of capturing the distribution function of neutrinos in neutron star merger simulations</strong>, Francois Foucart et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21822v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.21822v1</a></p>

<p>The collision of two neutron stars is a rich source of information about nuclear physics. In particular, the kilonova signal following a merger can help us elucidate the role of neutron stars in nucleosynthesis, and informs us about the properties of matter above nuclear saturation. Approximate modeling of neutrinos remains an important limitation to our ability to make predictions for these observables. Part of the problem is the fermionic nature of neutrinos. By the exclusion principle, the expected value $f_\nu$ for the number of neutrinos in a quantum state is at most 1. Any process producing neutrinos is suppressed by a blocking factor $(1-f_\nu)$. Recent simulations focused on neutrino physics mostly use a gray two-moment scheme to evolve neutrinos. This evolves integrals of $f_\nu$ over momentum space, preventing direct calculations of blocking factors. Monte Carlo methods may be an attractive alternative, providing access to the full distribution of neutrinos. Their current implementation is however inadequate to estimate $f_\nu$: in our most recent simulations, a single Monte Carlo packet causes, in the worst cases, estimates of $f_\nu$ to jump from $f_\nu=0$ to $f_\nu\sim 10^5$. While this is concerning, this brazen violation of the fermionic nature of neutrinos has been largely inconsequential as the interactions used in simulations avoid direct calculations of $f_\nu$. We are however reaching a level of modeling at which this problem can no longer be ignored. Here, we discuss the relatively simple origin of this issue. We then show that very rough estimates of $f_\nu$ can in theory be obtained in merger simulations, but that they will require a combination of unintuitive weighting schemes for Monte Carlo packets and smoothing of the neutrino distribution at coarser resolution than what the merger simulation uses.</p>

<p>2025-04-30, <strong>Turning a negative neutrino mass into a positive optical depth</strong>, Tanisha Jhaveri et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21813v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.21813v1</a></p>

<p>Under $\Lambda$CDM, recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measures from DESI, which favor a low matter density $\Omega_m$, are in moderate $2-3\sigma$ tension with cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. This tension appears alternately as a preference for the sum of neutrino masses dropping below the $\sum m_\nu = 0.06$eV value required by neutrino oscillation measurements to formally negative values; a discrepant value of $\Omega_m$ at 0.06eV; or preference for dynamical dark energy beyond $\Lambda$CDM. We show that this tension largely arises from the CMB lensing constraints on the calibration of the sound horizon for geometric measurements and relies on the measurement of the reionization optical depth $\tau$ from large-angle CMB polarization to set the lensing amplitude. Dropping these constraints removes the neutrino tension at $\sum m_\nu=0.06$eV entirely, favoring $\tau = 0.091\pm 0.011$ in $\Lambda$CDM. Beyond $\Lambda$CDM, it brings the preference for $w_0-w_a$ dynamical dark energy to below $95\%$ CL. We explore the freedom in interpreting the low-$\ell$ EE polarization constraint due to analysis choices and reionization modeling beyond the standard step-function assumption and find that this drops the neutrino tension in $\Lambda$CDM to below $95\%$ CL. Alternately, this raising of $\tau$ can also be achieved by the same reduction in large-scale curvature fluctuations that also ameliorates the low-$\ell$ temperature anomaly.</p>

<p>2025-04-30, <strong>Leptogenesis, $0νββ$ and lepton flavor violation in modular left-right asymmetric model with polyharmonic $Maaβ$ forms</strong>, Bhabana Kumar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21701v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.21701v1</a></p>

<p>In the absence of supersymmetry, modular forms need not be holomorphic functions of the modulus $\tau$. Using this idea, we construct a non-supersymmetric framework using polyharmonic $Maa\beta$ forms. In this approach, the Yukawa coupling is no longer strictly holomorphic in $\tau$ but instead incorporates both holomorphic and non-holomorphic components. We realize a non-supersymmetric, left-right asymmetric model based on the $\Gamma_3$ modular group, where the active neutrino masses are generated via an extended inverse seesaw mechanism. The model successfully predicts the sum of neutrino masses below the current experimental bound and accommodates neutrino mixing angles within the $3\sigma$ range. Given its strong predictive power in neutrino oscillation parameters, we further explore its implications for beyond Standard Model (BSM) phenomena, including neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay, lepton flavor violation (LFV), and baryogenesis via leptogenesis (BAU). Our findings indicate that the model predicts an effective Majorana mass and LFV branching ratios consistent with experimental constraints while also providing a viable explanation for the observed baryon asymmetry through resonant leptogenesis.</p>

<p>2025-04-30, <strong>Plausible Indication of Gamma-Ray Absorption by Dark Matter in NGC 1068</strong>, Gonzalo Herrera et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21560v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.21560v1</a></p>

<p>NGC 1068 is the brightest extragalactic source in high-energy neutrinos as seen by IceCube, yet the accompanying gamma-ray flux is orders of magnitude weaker. It has been argued that this indicates that the bulk of neutrinos and gamma rays are emitted in the innermost vicinity of the central supermassive black hole, which is transparent to neutrinos, but opaque to gamma rays. Even in such extreme scenarios for the acceleration of cosmic rays, astrophysical models typically overestimate the low-energy gamma-ray flux and/or require some fine-tuning in the physical parameters. Here we suggest instead that the dark matter surrounding the supermassive black hole may absorb the gamma rays, inducing the observed deficit. We show that for a dark matter-photon scattering cross section in the range $\sigma_{\rm DM-\gamma}/m_{\rm DM} \simeq 10^{-28}-10^{-30}$ cm$^2$/GeV, Fermi-LAT measurements can be well reconciled with IceCube data. We also present some simple particle physics examples that achieve the correct spectral energy dependence while respecting complementary constraints.</p>

<p>2025-04-30, <strong>A radiative neutrino mass model with leptoquarks under non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry</strong>, Takaaki Nomura et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21404v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.21404v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate a radiative seesaw model with two leptoquarks under non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry. The leptons and quarks belong to non-trivial representations of the modular $A_4$ and the structures of their mass matrices are restricted. Neutrino masses are generated at one-loop level via leptoquark inside loop diagram where structures of relevant Yukawa interactions are determined by the modular $A_4$ symmetry. We scan the free parameters in the model and try to fit all the observed data for both lepton and quark sectors. For allowed parameters, we show some predictions regarding neutrino observables such as sum of neutrino mass and neutrinoless double beta decay.</p>

<p>2025-05-01, <strong>Dark matter as a vector field: an action principle for the Einstein cluster</strong>, Pedro G. S. Fernandes et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00563v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.00563v1</a></p>

<p>We show that a vector field non-minimally coupled to gravity reproduces the dynamics of an Einstein cluster. Our results suggest a vectorial nature for dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-05-01, <strong>The Jackknife method as a new approach to validate strong lens mass models</strong>, Shun Nishida et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00553v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.00553v1</a></p>

<p>The accuracy of a mass model in the strong lensing analysis is crucial for unbiased predictions of physical quantities such as magnifications and time delays. While the mass model is optimized by changing parameters of the mass model to match predicted positions of multiple images with observations, positional uncertainties of multiple images often need to be boosted to take account of the complex structure of dark matter in lens objects, making the interpretation of the chi-square value difficult. We introduce the Jackknife method as a new method to validate strong lens mass models, specifically focusing on cluster-scale mass modeling. In this approach, we remove multiple images of a source from the fitting and optimize the mass model using multiple images of the remaining sources. We then calculate the multiple images of the removed source and quantitatively evaluate how well they match the observed positions. We find that the Jackknife method performs effectively in simulations using a simple model. We also demonstrate our method with mass modeling of the galaxy cluster MACS J0647.7+7015. We discuss the potential of using the Jackknife method to validate the error estimation of the physical quantities by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>2025-05-01, <strong>Probing ALP-portal Fermionic Dark Matter at the $e^+e^-$ Colliders</strong>, Subhaditya Bhattacharya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00478v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.00478v1</a></p>

<p>Axion-like particles (ALPs) are promising candidates for mediating interactions between a dark sector and the Standard Model (SM). In this work, considering the effective interactions of ALPs with the SM gauge bosons and a fermion dark matter (DM), we explore the DM relic satisfied parameter space and assess its testability through indirect searches. The potential of probing such ALP-portal fermionic DM at electron-positron colliders is investigated with the mono-photon + missing energy final states. We show that a spectacular distinction between the signal and SM background is possible via missing energy variable, the seed of which lies in the ALP-photon interaction, which also governs the relic density of DM. We further discuss the sensitivity of ALP-photon coupling using the $\chi^2$ analysis at the future electron-positron collider specifications.</p>

<p>2025-05-01, <strong>Interactions of the scalaron dark matter in $f (R)$ gravity</strong>, Yuri Shtanov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00324v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.00324v1</a></p>

<p>In $f(R)$ gravity, the scalaron$\unicode{x2014}$a scalar degree of freedom arising from modification of General Relativity$\unicode{x2014}$could account for all dark matter if its mass lies in the meV$\unicode{x2013}$MeV range. In this work, we revisit the scalaron’s interactions with Standard Model particles, assuming their minimal coupling to gravity. In particular, we refine the scalaron decay rate into photons. Assuming the scalaron constitutes all of dark matter, we calculate the average cosmological background radiation produced by these decays. We also estimate the contribution of primordial thermal scalarons to the present dark matter density and find it to be negligible. This supports the original scenario in which the scalaron dark matter behaves as a coherently oscillating field.</p>

<p>2025-04-30, <strong>Axion searches at colliders</strong>, Michele Tammaro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00124v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.00124v1</a></p>

<p>We provide an introduction to searches for axions and Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) at colliders. After covering the basics of collider physics, with a focus on production and detection of new particles, we give a rather broad introduction into searches for dark sectors at colliders. While our focus is on searches for light dark sectors, with the special emphasis on ALPs, we also contrast these with searches for heavy dark matter. In the final part of the notes we provide a ``tutorial’’, a worked out example of a search for a photo-philic ALP in $e^+e^-$ collisions, reflecting the actual analysis that was performed at Belle-II with early data.</p>

<p>2025-04-30, <strong>Accretion inside astrophysical objects : Effects of rotation and viscosity</strong>, H. A. Adarsha et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21843v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.21843v1</a></p>

<p>Sub-solar mass black holes could show up in gravitational observations in future and near-solar mass black holes might have been involved in the events GW190425 and GW190814. Since they cannot form from the stellar evolution, their creation requires exotic mechanisms. One such mechanism involves the capture of dark matter particles by stellar objects and their thermalization. When the criterion for the collapse of these dark matter particles is satisfied, a tiny endoparasitic black hole (EBH) forms and then it accretes matter from the host. The EBH may transmute the host into a black hole of nearly the same mass as the host or lesser, depending on the type of accretion. We examine this complex and poorly explored accretion mechanism, considering the effects of rotation and viscosity but ignoring some other effects, such as those of pressure and magnetic field, as the first step. Using a general framework to assess the effects of rotation and viscosity on accretion, we show that the accretion could be stalled in some white dwarfs, but not in neutron stars. The stalled accretion should cause an opening in the host’s polar regions, the extent of which depends on the mass and spin of the host.</p>

<p>By employing the extended most attractive channel hypothesis, we show that QCD-like gauge dynamics is possible in the dark-technicolour paradigm. The dark-technicolour paradigm can produce the mass of the Higgs boson, and at the same time, the $S$-parameter is also satisfied. Moreover, the dark-technicolour paradigm can provide a solution of the flavour problem by accommodating the standard HVM or the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism within its framework. We present the inclusive collider signatures, such as $t\bar{t}$ and $\gamma \gamma$, of the lowest lying scalars and pseudoscalars of the dark-technicolour paradigm, for the scenarios, when the standard HVM or the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism are implemented within its framework. The collider signatures are investigated at the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider, the high-energy Large Hadron Collider, and a 100 TeV future hadron collider. Several signatures are within the reach of the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider. Additionally, one of the dark-Higgs of the model can address $95.4$ GeV excess reported by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. Furthermore, one of the dark-Higgs can act like a new class of chirality-dependent dark-matter particles.</p>

<p>The nature of dark matter is one of the most fundamental questions in cosmology. Using the cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN) and DESI’s new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), we find the robust $\sim2\,\sigma$ evidences of the evolution of dark matter in the dynamical dark matter (DDM) model, $\omega_{dm}(a)=\omega_{dm0}+\omega_{dma}(1-a)$. Based on CMB data, we find a very strong linear relation $\omega_{dma}=-\omega_{dm0}$, inducing the single-parameter DDM model, $\omega_{dm}(a)=\omega_{dm}a$, where the $\sim2\,\sigma$ DDM evidences is well captured and even strengthened. We demonstrate that there are beyond $2\,\sigma$ evidences of the coexistence of DDM and dynamical dark energy using the combinations of CMB, DESI BAO and Pantheon+ SN data. In such models, at a beyond $5\,\sigma$ confidence level, we verify that the universe remains in a matter-dominated state for a substantial period in the past, accelerate in the distant future and finally becomes completely dominated by dark matter. We propose that the ultimate fate of the universe is the ``Super Rip’’ induced by dark matter with an extremely negative pressure. Our findings fundamentally challenge the prevailing understanding of cosmic acceleration and deepen our insight into the universe’s evolution.</p>

<p>Observations of microlensed gravitational waves (GWs) emanated by compact binary coalescences (CBCs) are essential for studying the mass density distribution in the universe, including black holes and dark matter halos. However, no confident detection of microlensed GWs have been reported to date. There are two important challenges in the identification of microlensed GWs. The first is that the source waveform and lens structure models are not known a-priori. The second is that certain classes of unlensed GWs could mimic microlensed GWs, resulting in undesirable false alarms. In this work, we propose to use the Kramers-Kronig relation for gravitational lensing systems. We argue that such systems are essentially linear response systems obeying causality, where KK relation must hold. The power of this method lies in the fact that microlensed GWs, regardless of the lens structure, must obey KK relation, while unlensed GW events are not in general expected to obey it. This, in principle, allows us to identify microlensed GWs while dismissing microlensing mimickers. We provide the first important steps towards a methodology that exploits KK relation, and test its usefulness under idealized conditions.</p>

<p>Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 (UMa3/U1) is the faintest Milky Way satellite discovered to date, exhibiting a half-light radius of 3 $\pm$ 1 pc and an absolute V-band magnitude of +2.2 $\pm$ 0.4. Previous studies suggest UMa3/U1 is a dwarf galaxy, based on its large internal velocity dispersion and the improbability (indicated by dynamical cluster simulations) of its long-term survival if it were a dark-matter-free star cluster. In this paper, we model the evolution of UMa3/U1 as a star cluster using collisional N-body simulations that include a description of stellar evolution and the external tidal field of the Milky Way, with some simulations including primordial binaries. We find that UMa3/U1 has a substantial remaining lifetime of 2.7 $\pm$ 0.4 Gyr, primarily due to the retention of compact stellar remnants within the cluster. This retention is facilitated by mass segregation and the preferential loss of low-mass stars. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the observed large velocity dispersion of UMa3/U1 can be successfully reproduced. These results support the possibility that UMa3/U1 is a self-gravitating star cluster. Our simulations reveal that modelling UMa3/U1 as a dark matter free star cluster produces a markedly altered present-day mass function, driven by a strong depletion of low-mass stars. However, the degree of mass segregation among the visible stars is not statistically significant. We therefore recommend that future observations of UMa3/U1 and other very small Milky Way satellites focus on measuring their present-day mass functions to determine their nature.</p>

<p>2025-04-30, <strong>Interplay of $95$ GeV Diphoton Excess and Dark Matter in Supersymmetric Triplet Model</strong>, Zetian Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21273v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.21273v1</a></p>

<p>The decay of the Higgs boson and the nature of dark matter remain fundamental challenges in particle physics. We investigate the $95$ GeV diphoton excess and dark matter within the framework of the triplet-extended Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (TMSSM). In this model, an additional Hypercharge $Y=0$, $SU(2)_L$ triplet superfield is introduced. Mixing between the triplet and doublet Higgs states enhances the diphoton signal strength of the $95$ GeV Higgs boson, resulting in $\mu_{\gamma\gamma}^{\text{CMS+ATLAS}} = 0.24_{-0.08}^{+0.09}$, which is consistent with experimental observations. This enhancement arises primarily from charged Higgs loop contributions. Additionally, the model accommodates viable dark matter candidates in the form of a bino-dominated neutralino. The relic density is reduced to the observed value through resonance-enhanced annihilation via the Higgs portal or co-annihilation with the triplino or higgsino. This reduction remains consistent with constraints from direct and indirect detection experiments. A comprehensive parameter scan demonstrates that the TMSSM can simultaneously explain the $95$ GeV diphoton excess, the observed $125$ GeV Higgs mass, and the dark matter relic density, establishing a compelling and theoretically consistent framework.</p>

<p>We present an analysis of the young stellar moving group ASCC 127 using Gaia DR3 data, significantly expanding its membership to 3,971 stars – double the number identified in previous studies. Using kinematic and distance criteria, ASCC 127 is divided into five subgroups (Groups 1-5) with ages spanning from 15 to 32 Myr. Groups 1-5 are spatially linked to the Cepheus Flare star-forming region, revealing potential evidence of four sequential star formation episodes at approximately 32 Myr, 20 Myr, 15 Myr, and 7 Myr. Through dust and gas mapping, we identify a spatial cavity extending several tens of parsecs, which may have resulted from feedback processes such as supernovae associated with earlier generations of stars in the region. This structure, along with the larger Loop III feature, indicates that feedback from massive stars likely influenced the interstellar medium (ISM). By integrating young stellar populations with ISM studies, we provide a detailed picture of the feedback-driven star formation history in the Cepheus Flare region.</p>

<p>In numerical simulations of core-collapse supernova and binary neutron stars mergers information about the energetics and composition of matter is implemented via external tables covering the huge ranges of thermodynamic conditions explored during the astrophysical evolution. More than 120 general purpose equation of state tables have been contributed so far. Not all of them comply with current constraints from theoretical and experimental nuclear physics and astrophysical observations of neutron stars. Systematic investigations of the role that dense matter properties play in the evolution of these astrophysical phenomena require that more equation of state tables are provided. We build a set of general purpose equation of state tables. At zero temperature, they comply with all currently accepted constraints, including ab initio chiral effective field theory calculations of pure neutron and symmetric nuclear matter. This set is designed to explore a wide variety of the behaviors of the effective masses as functions of density, which is reflected into a wide range of thermal behaviors. We employ Brussels extended Skyrme interactions generated by means of Bayesian inference techniques. An extended nuclear statistical equilibrium model is developed for modeling sub-saturated inhomogeneous nuclear matter. We study the properties of sub-saturated inhomogeneous nuclear matter over wide ranges of density, temperature and proton fraction. We analyze the mechanisms of transition to homogeneous matter and estimate the transition density. Our key results include the presence of a think $^{14}$He layer in the inner crusts of (neo-)neutron stars, significant abundance of other exotic isotopes of H and He in warm and neutron rich matter and a detailed study of the thermodynamic stability of cold stellar matter. The equation of state tables will be publicly available in the Compose online database.</p>

<p>2025-04-30, <strong>The maximum mass and rotational kinetic energy of rapidly rotating neutron stars</strong>, Shao-Peng Tang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21408v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.21408v1</a></p>

<p>Rapid uniformly-rotating neutron stars are expected to be formed for instance in the collapse of some massive stars, the accretion of some compact object binaries, and some double neutron star mergers. The huge amount of the rotational energy has been widely believed to be the source of some cosmic gamma-ray bursts and superluminous supernovae. Benefited from the tight constraints on the equation of state of the neutron star matter set by the latest multi-messenger data, the chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), here we present the maximum gravitational mass as well as the kinetic rotational energy for a neutron star at a given spin period. Our nonparametric EOS analysis reveals that the critical Keplerian configurations ($\Omega_{\rm kep}^{\rm crit}=1.00\pm0.07\times 10^{4}~ {\rm rad/s}$) can sustain maximum gravitational masses of $M_{\rm kep}^{\rm crit}=2.76^{+0.11}_{-0.09} M_\odot$ with corresponding rotational energy reaching $E_{\rm rot,kep}^{\rm crit}=2.38^{+0.25}_{-0.24}\times 10^{53}$. However, the maximum rotational energy that can be feasibly extracted from a neutron star is limited to $1.40^{+0.15}_{-0.13}\times 10^{53}$ erg, which holds for a baryon mass of $2.68^{+0.10}_{-0.09}M_\odot$. All these parameters, obtained via the nonparametric reconstruction of the equation of state, are at the $68.3\%$ confidence level and the adoption of a quarkonic model yields rather similar results. These findings are found to have already set some intriguing constraints on the millisecond magnetar interpretation of some exciting data.</p>

<p>2025-04-30, <strong>Dynamical Dark Energy in the Crosshairs: A Joint Analysis with DESI, Pantheon plus, and TDCOSMO Constraints</strong>, Tonghua Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21373v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.21373v1</a></p>

<p>The cosmological tensions between early- and late-Universe probes, particularly the Hubble tension ($H_0$) and $S_8$ discrepancy, challenge the validity of the standard ${\rm{\Lambda}CDM}$ model. Motivated by these tensions, we perform a comprehensive joint analysis of three representative dark energy models - ${\rm{\Lambda}CDM}$, the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, and the Phenomenologically Emergent Dark Energy (PEDE) model - using the latest observational datasets: baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI Data Releases 1 and 2 (DR1/DR2), the Pantheon Plus sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and time-delay cosmography from TDCOSMO lensing. Our multi-probe approach breaks key degeneracies among cosmological parameters ($H_0$, $r_d$, and $M_B$) and provides robust constraints on dark energy dynamics. The CPL model yields a statistically significant improvement over ${\rm{\Lambda}CDM}$, with $\Delta \chi^2 \approx -3.6$ for DESI DR2+Pantheon Plus+TDCOSMO, favoring a quintessence-like behavior ($w_0=-0.87^{+0.045 }_{-0.045} $, $w_a=-0.41^{+ 0.28}_{-0.28}$ at 1$\sigma$ confidence level). In contrast, the PEDE model exhibits severe tension with observations, yielding $\Delta \chi^2 \approx +53.1$ (DR1) and $\Delta \chi^2 \approx +132.3$ (DR2), despite its potential to marginally alleviate the $H_0$ tension. DESI DR2 tightens constraints on dynamical dark energy by $\sim$40\%, reinforcing evidence for redshift-evolving $w(z)$. Remarkably, our results demonstrate that such data combination can achieve precision comparable to Planck CMB measurements for dynamical dark energy studies, while offering complementary advantages in probing the late-time universe. This synergy between different observational data significantly enhances our ability to constrain dark energy properties.</p>
