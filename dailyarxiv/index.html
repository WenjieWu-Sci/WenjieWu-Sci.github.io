<p>2024-01-29, <strong>Three-band extension for the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model</strong>, Konstantin V. Grigorishin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16346v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.16346v1</a></p>

<p>By analogy with the Ginzburg-Landau theory of multi-band superconductors with inner (interband) Josephson couplings we formulate the three-band Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model with weak Josephson couplings between strongly asymmetrical condensates of scalar (Higgs) fields. Unlike usual single-band model, we found three Higgs bosons corresponding to three generations of particles, moreover the heaviest of them corresponds to the already discovered H-boson from the single-band theory and decay into fermions of only the third generation. The other two decay into fermions of the first and second generations accordingly, but they are difficult to observe due to very poor conditions for production. We found two sterile ultra-light Leggett bosons, the Bose condensates of which form the dark halos of galaxies and their clusters (i.e so called “dark matter”). The masses of the Leggett bosons are determined by the coefficient of the interband coupling and can be arbitrarily small ($\sim 10^{-20}\mathrm{eV}$) due to non-perturbativeness of the interband coupling. Since propagation of Leggett bosons is not accompanied by current, these bosons are not absorbed by gauge fields unlike the common-mode Goldstone bosons. Three coupled condensates of the scalar fields causes the existence of three generations of leptons, where each generation interacts with the corresponding condensate getting mass. The interflavour mixing between the generations of active neutrinos and sterile right-handed neutrinos in the three-band system causes the existence of mass states of neutrino without interaction with the Higgs condensates.</p>

<p>2024-01-29, <strong>Neutrino Masses and Higher Degree Siegel Modular Forms</strong>, Maibam Ricky Devi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16257v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.16257v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we have analyzed a neutrino model within the distinct framework of modular forms with degree, $ g&gt;1 $ . This offers a more generalized scenario of modular forms which is popularly known as Siegel modular forms. We explore the implications of this special case of automorphic forms for physics beyond the standard model (BSM) within the lepton sector. In our model, we explicitly treat the Yukawa couplings as Siegel modular forms with both degree and level being equivalent to 2. We restrict our modulus parameter for $ \tau_{1}=\tau_{2} $ spanning within the finite modular $ S_{4}\times Z_{2} $ space. This helps us for a broader understanding of the multiplets at higher degree and simplifies the process of model building of the fermion masses. At the end, we compute the unknown neutrino oscillation parameters and find the optimal values of the modulus parameters $ \tau_{1} $ and $ \tau_{3} $ for which the values of the Yukawa couplings are consistent at $ 3\sigma $ for the input parameters of neutrinos as given in NuFIT 5.2 and discuss its underlying physics.</p>

<p>2024-01-29, <strong>Simultaneous Measurement of Half-Life and Spectral Shape of $^{115}$In $β$-decay with an Indium Iodide Cryogenic Calorimeter</strong>, L. Pagnanini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16059v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.16059v1</a></p>

<p>Current bounds on neutrino Majorana mass are affected by significant uncertainties in the nuclear calculations for neutrinoless double-beta decay. A key issue for a data-driven improvement of the nuclear theory is the actual value of the axial coupling constant $g_A$, which can be investigated through forbidden $\beta$-decays. We present the first measurement of 4$^{th}$-forbidden $\beta$-decay of $^{115}$In with a cryogenic calorimeter based on Indium Iodide. Exploiting the enhanced spectral shape method for the first time to this isotope, our study accurately determines simultaneously spectral shape, $g_A$, and half-life. The Interacting Shell Model, which best fits our data, indicates a half-life for this decay at $T_{1/2}=(5.26\pm0.06) \times 10^{14}$,yr.</p>

<p>2024-01-29, <strong>SN1987A constraints to BSM models with extra neutral bosons near the trapping regime: $U(1)_{L_μ-L_τ}$ model as an illustrative example</strong>, Kwang-Chang Lai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16023v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.16023v1</a></p>

<p>New physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) with an extra neutral boson can be constrained from the observation of SN1987A, since the production of this neutral boson in a supernova (SN) could accelerate the SN cooling and potentially lead to a period of the neutrino burst incompatible with the observation. The constraint to the model is formulated by the condition $L_{\rm NB}\leq 3\times 10^{52}$ erg/s according to G. Raffelt with $L_{\rm NB}$ the luminosity of BSM neutral boson. Computing the above luminosity in the large coupling case, the so-called trapping regime, is non-trivial since the luminosity is a competition between the large production rate and the efficient absorption or decay rate of the neutral boson. We illustrate such a subtlety using $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model as an example where the $Z^{\prime}$ luminosity, $L_{Z^{\prime}}$, from the neutrinosphere is calculated.   We calculate $Z’$ production, absorption, and decay rates through pair-coalescence, semi-Compton, loop-bremsstrahlung from proton-neutron scattering, and their inverse processes in a benchmark SN simulation with muons. We point out that, as the coupling constant $g_{Z’}$ increases, $L_{Z^{\prime}}$ shall be approaching a constant plateau value for a given $m_{Z’}$ instead of monotonically decreasing down to zero as obtained in the previous literature. We demonstrate that this plateau phenomenon can be understood by physical arguments and justified by numerical calculations. With a different result on $L_{Z^{\prime}}$ from the previous one, we discuss impacts on the constraints to $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ parameter space by SN1987A. The implication of our result to the similar constraint on a generic BSM model with an extra neutral boson is also discussed.</p>

<p>2024-01-29, <strong>Primordial black holes and scalar-induced gravitational waves from the polynomial attractor model</strong>, Zhongkai Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16069v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.16069v1</a></p>

<p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) generated in the early universe are considered as one of the candidates for dark matter. To produce PBHs with sufficient abundance, the primordial scalar power spectrum needs to be enhanced to the order of 0.01. Considering the third-order polynomial potential with polynomial $\alpha$ attractors, we show that PBHs with the mass about $10^{17}$g can be produced while satisfying the constraints from the cosmic microwave background observations at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level. The mass of PBHs produced in the polynomial $\alpha$ attractors can be much bigger than that in the exponential $\alpha$ attractors. By adding a negative power-law term to the polynomials, abundant PBHs with different masses and the accompany scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) with different peak frequency are easily generated. The PBHs with masses around $10^{-15}-10^{-12}$ $M_\odot$ can account for almost all dark matter. The SIGWs generated in the nanohertz band can explain the recent detection of stochastic gravitational wave background by the pulsar timing array observations. The non-Gaussianity of the primordial curvature perturbations in the squeezed and equilateral limits are calculated numerically. We find that the non-Gaussianity correction greatly enhances the PBH abundance which makes the production of PBHs much easier, but the effect of non-Gaussianity on the generation of SIGWs is negligible.</p>

<p>2024-01-29, <strong>The phase-space distribution of the M81 satellite system</strong>, Oliver Müller et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16002v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.16002v1</a></p>

<p>The spatial distribution of dwarf galaxies around their host galaxies is a critical test for the standard model of cosmology because it probes the dynamics of dark matter halos and is independent of the internal baryonic processes of galaxies. Co-moving planes-of-satellites have been found around the Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy, and the nearby CenA galaxy, which seem to be at odds with the standard model of galaxy formation. Another nearby galaxy group, with a putative flattened distribution of dwarfs, is the M81 group. We present a quantitative analysis of the distribution of the M81 satellites using a Hough transform to detect linear structures. We confirm a flattened distribution of dwarf galaxies. Depending on the morphological type, we find a minor-to-major axis ratio of the satellite distribution to be 0.5 (all types) or 0.3 (dSph), which is in line with previous results for the M81 group. Comparing the orientation of this flattened structure in 3D with the surrounding large-scale matter distribution, we find a strong alignment with the local sheet and the planes-of-satellites around the Andromeda galaxy and Cen A. Employing velocities for a sub-sample of the dwarfs, we find no signal of co-rotation. Comparing the flattening and motion of the M81 dwarf galaxy system with IllustrisTNG50 we find good agreement between observations and simulations, but caution that i) velocity information of half of the satellites is missing, ii) velocities are coming mainly from dwarf irregulars clustered around NGC3077, which may hint towards an infall of a dwarf galaxy group and iii) some of the dwarfs may actually be tidal dwarf galaxies. From the missing velocities, we predict that the observed frequency within TNG may range between 2 to 29 per cent. Any conclusions about the agreement/disagreement with cosmological models needs to wait for a more complete picture of the dwarf galaxy system.</p>

<p>2024-01-29, <strong>The sizes of bright Lyman-break galaxies at $z\simeq3-5$ with JWST PRIMER</strong>, R. G. Varadaraj et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15971v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.15971v1</a></p>

<p>We use data from the JWST Public Release IMaging for Extragalactic Research (PRIMER) survey to measure the size scaling relations of 1668 rest-frame UV-bright Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at $z=3-5$ with stellar masses $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) &gt; 9$. The sample was selected from seeing-dominated ground-based data, presenting an unbiased sampling of the morphology and size distributions of luminous sources. We fit S'ersic profiles to eight NIRCam bands and also measure a non-parametric half-light radius. We find that the size distributions with both measurements are well-fit by a log-normal distribution at all redshifts, consistent with disk formation models where size is governed by host dark-matter halo angular momentum. We find a size-redshift evolution of $R_{e} = 3.51(1+z)^{-0.60\pm0.22}$ kpc, in agreement with JWST studies. When considering the typical (modal) size over $z=3-5$, we find little evolution with bright LBGs remaining compact at $R_{e}\simeq0.7-0.9$ kpc. Simultaneously, we find evidence for a build-up of large ($R_{e} &gt; 2$ kpc) galaxies by $z=3$. We find some evidence for a negatively sloped size-mass relation at $z=5$ when S'ersic profiles are used to fit the data in F200W. The intrinsic scatter in our size-mass relations increases at higher redshifts. Additionally, measurements probing the rest-UV (F200W) show larger intrinsic scatter than those probing the rest-optical (F356W). Finally, we leverage rest-UV and rest-optical photometry to show that disky galaxies are well established by $z=5$, but are beginning to undergo dissipative processes, such as mergers, by $z=3$. The agreement of our size-mass and size-luminosity relations with simulations provides tentative evidence for centrally concentrated star formation at high-redshift.</p>

<p>2024-01-29, <strong>Wormholes inside stars and black holes</strong>, Shin’ichi Nojiri et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15868v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.15868v1</a></p>

<p>We construct models of two exotic objects: (i) a wormhole whose throat is hidden by a stellar object like a neutron star; and (ii) a wormhole inside a black hole. We work within Einstein’s gravity coupled to two scalar fields with a specific choice of the scalar field Lagrangian. In general, the model contains ghosts, but they are eliminated using the constraints given by the Lagrange multiplier fields. The constraints are a generalization of the mimetic constraint, where non-dynamical dark matter effectively appears. As a result, in our model, instead of the non-dynamical dark matter, non-dynamical exotic matter like a phantom effectively arises. For the mixed wormhole-plus-star system, we find the corresponding mass-radius relations and show that it is possible to get characteristics comparable to those of ordinary neutron stars. For the wormhole inside the black hole, we find an extremal limit where the radius of the throat coincides with the radius of the event horizon and demonstrate that the Hawking temperature vanishes in this limit.</p>

<p>2024-01-29, <strong>Galactic Structure From Binary Pulsar Accelerations: Beyond Smooth Models</strong>, Thomas Donlon II et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15808v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.15808v1</a></p>

<p>We measure the line-of-sight accelerations of 26 binary pulsars due to the Milky Way’s gravitational potential, and produce a 3-dimensional map of the acceleration field of the Galaxy. Acceleration measurements directly give us the change in the line-of-sight velocity at present day, without requiring any assumptions inherent to kinematic modeling. We measure the Oort limit ($\rho_0=0.062\pm0.017$ \msun/pc$^3$) and the dark matter density in the midplane ($\rho_{0,\textrm{DM}}=-0.010\pm0.018$ \msun/pc$^3$); these values are similar to, but have smaller uncertainties than previous pulsar timing measurements of these quantities. Here, we provide for the first time, values for the Oort constants and the slope of the rotation curve from direct acceleration measurements. We find that $A=15.4\pm2.6$ km/s/kpc and $B=-13.1\pm2.6$ km/s/kpc (consistent with results from \textit{Gaia}), and the slope of the rotation curve near the Sun is $-2\pm5$ km/s/kpc. We show that the Galactic acceleration field is clearly asymmetric, but due to data limitations it is not yet clear which physical processes drive this asymmetry. We provide updated models of the Galactic potential that account for various sources of disequilibrium; these models are incompatible with commonly used kinematic potentials. This indicates that use of kinematically derived Galactic potentials in precision tests (e.g., in tests of general relativity with pulsar timing) may be subject to larger uncertainties than reported. The acceleration data indicates that the mass of the Galaxy within the Solar circle is $2.3 \times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, roughly twice as large as currently accepted models. Additionally, the residuals of the acceleration data compared to existing Galactic models have a dependence on radial position; this trend can be explained if the Sun has an additional acceleration away from the Galactic center.</p>

<p>2024-01-29, <strong>Detection of metal enrichment by SN 2011jm in NGC 4809</strong>, Yulong Gao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16172v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.16172v1</a></p>

<p>The cosmic metals are believed to originate from stellar and supernovae (SNe) nucleosynthesis, dispersed into the interstellar medium (ISM) through stellar winds and supernova explosions. In this paper, we present the clear evidence of metal enrichment by a type Ic SN 2011jm in the galaxy NGC 4809, utilizing high spatial resolution Integral Field Units (IFU) observations obtained from the Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). Despite SN 2011jm being surrounded by metal-deficient ISM ($\sim 0.25 \ Z_\odot$) at a scale about 100 pc, we clearly detect enriched oxygen abundance ($\sim 0.35 \ Z_\odot$) and a noteworthy nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio at the SN site. Remarkably, the metal pollution is confined to a smaller scale ( $\leq$ 13 pc). We posit that the enhanced ionized metal stems from stellar winds emitted by massive stars or previous SNe explosions. This observation may represent the first direct detection of chemical pollution by stellar feedback in star-forming galaxies beyond the Local Volume.</p>

<p>2024-01-29, <strong>Discovery of an old supernova remnant candidate through carbon monoxide line emission</strong>, Xin Zhou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16038v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.16038v1</a></p>

<p>Most old supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Milky Way have not yet been identified. Considering their large potential number and the sufficient momentum-energy transfer to the interstellar medium (ISM), they are a key part of our understanding of the overall role of SNRs in the ISM. Here we report our discovery of an expanding molecular shell identified by CO line observations, namely G16.11-0.51. It covers a known SNR, specifically G16.0-0.5, and is larger in size, i.e. 0.56 deg over 0.20 deg. Based on its spatial and kinematic structures, weak nonthermal radio-continuum emission, and derived physical properties, we suggest that it is an old SNR. At a systemic velocity of +41.3 km s^-1, the best estimated kinematic distance of G16.11-0.51 is ~3.2 kpc, implying its radius of about 15.6 pc. The age of G16.11-0.51 is estimated to be greater than ~10^5 yr, and, in a dense molecular environment, it has formed dense and thin shell layers. The kinetic energy of the expanding molecular gas of G16.11-0.51 is about 6.4x10^49 erg, accounting for approximately six percent of the initial SN explosion energy. Although old SNRs have essentially become cold and hard to detect, our discovery suggests that they can be found by searching for CO line emissions.</p>

<p>2024-01-29, <strong>Physical Parameters of 11,100 Short-Period ASAS-SN Eclipsing Contact Binaries</strong>, Xu-Zhi Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15986v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.15986v1</a></p>

<p>Starting from more than 11,200 short-period (less than 0.5 days) EW-type eclipsing binary candidates with the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) V-band light curves, we use MCMC and neural networks (NNs) to obtain the mass ratio ($q$), orbital inclination ($incl$), fill-out factor ($f$) and temperature ratio ($T_s/T_p$). After cross-matching with the Gaia DR3 database, the final sample contains parameters of 2,399 A-type and 8,712 W-type contact binaries (CBs). We present the distributions of parameters of these 11,111 short-period CBs. The mass ratio ($q$) and fill-out factor ($f$) are found to obey log-normal distributions, and the remaining parameters obey normal distributions. There is a significant period-temperature correlation of these CBs. Additionally, the temperature ratio (${T_s}$/${T_p}$) tends to increase as the orbital period decreases for W-type CBs. There is no significant correlation between them for A-type CBs. The mass ratio and fill-out factor ($q-f$) diagram suggest there is no significant correlation between these two parameters. A clear correlation exists between the mass ratio and radius ratio. The radius ratio increases with the mass ratio. Moreover, the deep fill-out CBs tend to fall on the upper boundary of the $q\(-\){R_s}$/${R_p}$ distribution, while the shallow fill-out CBs fall on the lower boundary.</p>

<p>The precise definition of the lower mass limit of red supergiant stars (RSGs) is an open question in astrophysics and does not attract too much attention. Here we assemble a spectroscopic evolved cool star sample with 6,602 targets, including RSGs, asymptotic giant branch stars, and red giant branch stars, in the Large Magellanic Cloud based on \textit{Gaia} DR3 and SDSS-IV/APOGEE-2. The reference spectrum of each stellar population is built according to the quantile range of relative intensity ($1\%\sim99\%$). Five different methods, e.g., chi-square ($\chi^2$), cosine similarity (CS), machine learning (ML), equivalent width (EW), and line ratio (LR), are used in order to separate different stellar populations. The ML and $\chi^2$ provide the best and relatively consistent prediction of certain population. The derived lower limit of the RSG population is able to reach to the $\rm K_S$-band tip of red giant branch ($\rm K_S~$$\approx12.0$ mag), indicating a luminosity as low as about $10^{3.5}~L_{\sun}$, which corresponds to a stellar radius only about $100~R_{\sun}$. Given the mass-luminosity relation of $L/L_\sun =f(M/M_\sun)^3$ with $f\approx15.5\pm3$ and taking into account of the mass loss of faint RSGs up to now, the minimal initial mass of the RSG population would be about $6.1\pm0.4~M_\sun$, which is much lower than the traditional threshold of $8~M_\sun$ for the massive stars. This is the first spectroscopic evidence, indicating that the lower mass limit of RSG population is around $6~M_\sun$. However, the destinies of such faint RSGs are still elusive and may have large impact on the stellar evolutionary and supernova models.</p>
