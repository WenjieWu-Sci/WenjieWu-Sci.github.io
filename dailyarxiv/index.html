<p>2023-06-01, <strong>Hard X-ray emission from blazars associated with high-energy neutrinos</strong>, A. V. Plavin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00960v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.00960v1</a></p>

<p>Bright blazars were found to be prominent neutrino sources, and a number of IceCube events were associated with them. Evaluating high-energy photon emission of such blazars is crucial for better understanding of the processes and regions where neutrinos are produced. Here, we focus on hard X-ray emission observed by the SRG/ART-XC telescope, by the Swift/BAT imager, and by the INTEGRAL/IBIS telescope. Their energy range ~10 keV and above is well-suited for probing photons that potentially participate in neutrino production by interacting with ultrarelativistic protons. We find that neutrino-associated blazars tend to demonstrate remarkably strong X-ray emission compared to other VLBI blazars in the sky, chance coincidence probability is p=0.5%. Both neutrinos and hard X-rays are found to come from blazars at cosmological distances z ~ 1, and are boosted by relativistic beaming that makes it possible to detect them on Earth. Our results suggest that neutrinos are produced within compact blazar jets, with target X-ray photons emitted from accelerated jet regions.</p>

<p>2023-06-01, <strong>Neutrino mass and nature through its mediation in atomic clock interference</strong>, José Bernabeu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00767v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.00767v1</a></p>

<p>The absolute mass of neutrinos and their nature are presently unknown. Aggregate matter has a coherent weak charge leading to a repulsive interaction mediated by a neutrino pair. Near its range at micron distances the virtual neutrinos are non-relativistic, giving a distinct behavior for Dirac versus Majorana mass terms. The magnitude and the distance dependence of the effective potential disentangle these fundamental properties of neutrinos. We propose an experiment to search for this potential based on the concept that the density dependent interaction of an atomic probe with a material source in one arm of an atomic clock interferometer generates a differential phase. The appropriate geometry of the device is selected using the saturation of the weak potential as a guide. The proposed experiment has the added benefit of being sensitive to gravity at micron distances. A strategy to suppress the competing Casimir-Polder interaction, depending on the electronic structure of the material source, as well as a way to compensate the gravitational interaction in the two arms of the interferometer is discussed.</p>

<p>2023-06-01, <strong>Associated Production of Fermionic Dark Matter and Neutrino at the Future Lepton Colliders</strong>, Shao-Feng Ge et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00657v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.00657v1</a></p>

<p>In light of the fermionic dark matter absorption on electron target that can be observed by direct detection experiments, we study its complementary searches at the future $e^+ e^-$ colliders such as CEPC, FCC-ee, ILC, and CLIC. Two typical processes, the mono-photon and electron-positron pair production associated with missing energy, can serve the purpose. While the mono-photon search prevails at CEPC, FCC-ee, and ILC, the $e^+ e^-E_{T}^{\rm miss}$ channel has more significant contributions at CLIC with much higher collision energy $\sqrt s$. The beam polarizations can help further suppressing the SM backgrounds to enhance the signal significance while differential cross sections can distinguish the Lorentz structure of various effective operators. The combined sensitivity can reach well above 1 TeV at CEPC/FCC-ee and ILC while it further touches 30 TeV at CLIC. Comparing with the updated results from the dark matter direct detection experiments (XENON1T, PandaX-II, PandaX-4T, LZ, and XENONnT), astrophysical $X/\gamma$ observations, and cosmological constraints, the collider searches can not just provide better sensitivity for light dark matter mass but also scan much wider mass range.</p>

<p>2023-06-01, <strong>Exploring the dark sectors via the cooling of white dwarfs</strong>, Jaime Hoefken Zink et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00517v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.00517v1</a></p>

<p>As dense and hot bodies with a well-understood equation of state, white dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to investigate new physics. In this paper, we examine the role of dark sectors, which are extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics that are not directly observable, in the cooling process of white dwarfs. Specifically, we examine the role of a dark photon, within the framework of a three-portal Model, in enhancing the neutrino emission during the cooling process of white dwarfs. We compare this scenario to the energy release predicted by the Standard Model. By analyzing the parameter space of dark sectors, our study aims to identify regions that could lead to significant deviations from the expected energy release of white dwarfs.</p>

<p>2023-06-01, <strong>Dynamical Inflation Stimulated Cogenesis</strong>, Debasish Borah et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00368v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.00368v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a minimal setup that realises dynamical inflection point inflation, and, using the same field content, generates neutrino masses, a baryon asymmetry of the universe, and dark matter. A dark $SU(2)_D$ gauge sector with a dark scalar doublet playing the role of inflaton is considered along with several doublet and singlet fermions sufficient to realise multiple inflection points in the inflaton potential. The singlet fermions couple to SM leptons and generate neutrino masses via the inverse seesaw mechanism. Those fermions also decay asymmetrically and out of equilibrium, generating a baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis. Some of the fermion doublets are dark matter, and they are produced via freeze-in annihilation of the same fermions that generate the lepton asymmetry. Reheating, leptogenesis, and dark matter are all at the TeV scale.</p>

<p>2023-06-01, <strong>Gravitational Wave Signatures of Gauged Baryon and Lepton Number</strong>, Jessica Bosch et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00332v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.00332v1</a></p>

<p>We demonstrate that novel types of gravitational wave signatures arise in theories with new gauge symmetries broken at high energy scales. For concreteness, we focus on models with gauged baryon number and lepton number, in which neutrino masses are generated via the type I seesaw mechanism, leptogenesis occurs through the decay of a heavy right-handed neutrino, and one of the new baryonic fields is a good dark matter candidate. Depending on the scalar content of the theory, the gravitational wave spectrum consists of contributions from cosmic strings, domain walls, and first order phase transitions. We show that a characteristic double-peaked signal from domain walls or a sharp domain wall peak over a flat cosmic string background may be generated. Those new signatures are within the reach of future experiments, such as Cosmic Explorer, Einstein Telescope, DECIGO, Big Bang Observer, and LISA.</p>

<p>2023-06-01, <strong>Neutrino-induced reactions on 18O and implications of 18O mixture in water Cherenkov detectors on supernova neutrino events</strong>, Toshio Suzuki et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00277v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.00277v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino-nucleus reaction cross sections on 18O are evaluated by shell-model calculations and compared with those on 16O. Important contributions from Gamow-Teller transitions are noticed for 18O (\nu_e, e^{-})18F in contrary to the case for 16O, where spin-dipole transitions are dominant contributions. Calculated cross sections for 18O(\nu_e, e^{-})18F are shown to be larger than for 16O at low neutrino energies below 20 MeV in natural water with the 0.205% admixture of 18O due to the lower threshold energy (1.66 MeV) for 18O than that for 16O (15.42 MeV). The resulting electron spectra, that is, the cross sections as functions of emitted electron energy Te, are also shown to be quite different, reflecting the different threshold energies. The electron spectra from (\nu_e, e^{-}) reactions on 18O and 16O in water Cherenkov detectors for supernova neutrino detection are investigated for both the cases with and without the neutrino oscillation and compared with those of the neutrino-electron scattering. It has been shown that the contribution from 18O (0.205% mixture) enhances the rates from 16O by 60% for the case without the oscillation and by 20-30% for the case with the oscillation below Te =20 MeV. For the case with the neutrino oscillation, the event rates for 18O and 16O become comparable to those of the neutrino-electron scattering. However, their rates at low energy (Te &lt; 20 MeV) are much smaller than those of the neutrino-electron scattering, which is important for the pointing accuracy to the supernova direction.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>Holographic neutrino transport in dense strongly-coupled matter</strong>, M. Järvinen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00192v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.00192v1</a></p>

<p>A (toy) model for cold and luke-warm strongly-coupled nuclear matter at finite baryon density and isospin chemical potential is used to study neutrino transport. The complete charged current two-point correlators are computed in the strongly-coupled medium and their impact on neutrino transport is analyzed. The full result is compared with various approximations for the current correlators and the distributions, including the degenerate approximation, the hydrodynamic approximation as well as the diffusive approximation and we comment on their successes. Further improvements are discussed.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>First demonstration of 30 eVee ionization energy resolution with Ricochet germanium cryogenic bolometers</strong>, C. Augier et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00166v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.00166v1</a></p>

<p>The future Ricochet experiment aims to search for new physics in the electroweak sector by measuring the Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering process from reactor antineutrinos with high precision down to the sub-100 eV nuclear recoil energy range. While the Ricochet collaboration is currently building the experimental setup at the reactor site, it is also finalizing the cryogenic detector arrays that will be integrated into the cryostat at the Institut Laue Langevin in early 2024. In this paper, we report on recent progress from the Ge cryogenic detector technology, called the CryoCube. More specifically, we present the first demonstration of a 30~eVee (electron equivalent) baseline ionization resolution (RMS) achieved with an early design of the detector assembly and its dedicated High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) based front-end electronics. This represents an order of magnitude improvement over the best ionization resolutions obtained on similar heat-and-ionization germanium cryogenic detectors from the EDELWEISS and SuperCDMS dark matter experiments, and a factor of three improvement compared to the first fully-cryogenic HEMT-based preamplifier coupled to a CDMS-II germanium detector. Additionally, we discuss the implications of these results in the context of the future Ricochet experiment and its expected background mitigation performance.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>Axion Helioscopes as Solar Thermometers</strong>, Sebastian Hoof et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00077v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.00077v1</a></p>

<p>Axions, if discovered, could serve as a powerful new messenger for studying astrophysical objects. In this study we show how the Sun’s spatial and spectral “axion image” can be inverted to infer the radial dependence of solar properties in a model-independent way. In particular, the future helioscope IAXO may allow us to accurately reconstruct the Sun’s temperature profile $T(r)$ in the region up to about 80% (40%) of the solar radius for an axion-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ of $6 \times 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ ($10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$). The statistical fluctuations in the photon data lead to a median precision of better than 10% (16%) in this region, and the corresponding median accuracy was better than 4% (7%). While our approach can simultaneously infer the radial profile of the Debye scale $\kappa_\text{s}(r)$, its weaker connection to the axion production rate leads to median accuracy and precision of worse than 30% and 50%, respectively. We discuss possible challenges and improvements for realistic setups, as well as extensions to more general axion models. We also highlight advantages of helioscopes over neutrino detectors.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>New Physics in Neutrino Oscillation: Nonunitarity or Nonorthogonality?</strong>, Chee Sheng Fong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19755v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19755v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino oscillation phenomenon is a definite evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) and high precision measurement of neutrino properties will certainly give us clue about what lies beyond the SM. In particular, precise measurements of the mixing matrix elements $U_{\alpha i}$ which relate the neutrino flavor $\alpha$ and mass $i$ eigenstates are crucial since new physics at scale beyond experimental reach can lead to a nonunitary $U$. This in turns results in nonorthogonal neutrino flavor states. How to calculate the oscillation probability in this scenario is an important theoretical issue that will be treated here. We show that probability constructed using theory of projection probability will ensure that the theory remains unitary in time evolution and the probabilities of neutrino of certain flavor being detected as all possible flavor states always sum up to unity. This result is crucial for discovery of new physics through neutrino oscillation phenomena.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>Measurement of the inclusive electron-neutrino charged-current cross section on ${}^{127}$I with the COHERENT NaI$ν$E detector</strong>, P. An et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19594v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19594v1</a></p>

<p>Using an 185-kg NaI[Tl] array, COHERENT has measured the inclusive electron-neutrino charged-current cross section on ${}^{127}$I with neutrinos produced by the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Iodine is one the heaviest targets for which low-energy ($\leq 50$ MeV) inelastic neutrino-nucleus processes have been measured, and this is the first measurement of its inclusive cross section. After a five-year detector exposure, COHERENT reports a flux-averaged cross section for electron neutrinos produced at a pion decay-at-rest source of $9.2^{+2.1}_{-1.8}\times10^{-40}$ cm$^2$. This corresponds to a value that is $\sim$41% lower than predicted using the MARLEY event generator with a measured Gamow-Teller strength distribution. In addition, the observed visible spectrum from charged-current scattering on ${}^{127}$I has been measured between 10 and 55 MeV, and the exclusive zero-neutron and one-or-more-neutron emission cross sections are measured to be $5.12_{-3.1}^{+3.4} \times 10^{-40}\mbox{ cm}^2$ and $2.2_{-0.5}^{+0.4} \times 10^{-40}\mbox{ cm}^2$, respectively.</p>

<p>2023-06-01, <strong>Gravitational collapse of matter in the presence of Quintessence and Phantom-like scalar fields</strong>, Priyanka Saha et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00805v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.00805v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we propose a model of the gravitational collapse of dark matter in the presence of quintessence or phantom-like scalar fields. Our treatment is based on the principles of general relativity up to virialization. We have chosen a spherical patch that starts to collapse gravitationally as it happens in top-hat collapse. It is seen that although the dark matter sector collapses the dark energy sector does keep a profile that is almost similar to the dark energy profile for the background expanding Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe for suitable model parameters. It is observed that in order to formulate the problem in the general relativistic setting one has to abandon the idea of a closed FLRW isolated collapsing patch. General relativity requires an external generalized Vaidya spacetime to be matched with the internal spherical patch whose dynamics is guided by the FLRW metric. It is shown that almost all collapses are accompanied by some flux of matter and radiation in the generalized Vaidya spacetime. Some of the spherical regions of the universe are seen not to collapse but expand eternally, producing void-like structures. Whether a spherical region will collapse or expand depends upon the initial values of the system and other model parameters. As this work shows that collapsing structures must emit some form of radiation, this may be taken as an observational signature of our proposal.</p>

<p>2023-06-01, <strong>Stability, quasinormal modes in a charged black hole in perfect fluid dark matter</strong>, Anish Das et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00646v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.00646v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we study time-like and null geodesics in a charged black hole background immersed in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM). Using the condition for circular geodesics, we evaluate the energy ($E$) and angular momentum ($L$) in terms of the radius ($r_c$) of the circular orbits. The existence and finite-ness of $E$ and $L$ constrain the possible range of PFDM parameter ($\chi$) and the radius of the circular orbit ($r_c$). We then use the Lyapunov exponent ($\lambda$) to study the stability of the geodesics. Then we analyze the critical exponent ($\gamma$) useful for determining the possibility of detection of gravitational wave signals. After that, we study the perturbation due to a massless scalar field in such a background and calculate the quasinrmal mode (QNM) frequencies and their dependence on PFDM parameter $\chi$ and black hole charge $Q$. Also, we compare the obtained QNM frequencies both in the exact case and in the eikonal limit. We also calculate the quality factor of the oscillating system and study its dependence on $\chi$ and $Q$. Finally, we evaluate the black hole shadow radius $R_s$ and graphically observe the effect of $\chi$ and $Q$ on it.</p>

<p>2023-06-01, <strong>Combination and summary of ATLAS dark matter searches interpreted in a 2HDM with a pseudo-scalar mediator using 139 fb$^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV $pp$ collision data</strong>, ATLAS Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00641v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.00641v1</a></p>

<p>Results from a wide range of searches targeting different experimental signatures with and without missing transverse momentum ($E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}$) are used to constrain a Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) with an additional pseudo-scalar mediating the interaction between ordinary and dark matter (2HDM+$a$). The analyses use up to 139 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider between 2015-2018. The results from three of the most sensitive searches are combined statistically. These searches target signatures with large $E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}$ and a leptonically decaying $Z$ boson; large $E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}$ and a Higgs boson decaying to bottom quarks; and production of charged Higgs bosons in final states with top and bottom quarks, respectively. Constraints are derived for several common as well as new benchmark scenarios within the 2HDM+$a$.</p>

<p>2023-06-01, <strong>Search for Boosted Dark Matter in COSINE-100</strong>, G. Adhikari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00322v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.00322v1</a></p>

<p>We search for energetic electron recoil signals induced by boosted dark matter (BDM) from the galactic center using the COSINE-100 array of NaI(Tl) crystal detectors at the Yangyang Underground Laboratory. The signal would be an excess of events with energies above 4MeV over the well-understood background. Because no excess of events are observed in a 97.7 kg$\cdot$years exposure, we set limits on BDM interactions under a variety of hypotheses. Notably, we explored the dark photon parameter space, leading to competitive limits compared to direct dark photon search experiments, particularly for dark photon masses below 4MeV and considering the invisible decay mode. Furthermore, by comparing our results with a previous BDM search conducted by the Super- Kamionkande experiment, we found that the COSINE-100 detector has advantages in searching for low-mass dark matter. This analysis demonstrates the potential of the COSINE-100 detector to search for MeV electron recoil signals produced by the dark sector particle interactions.</p>

<p>It is important to understand the implications of current observational constraints and potential signatures on the thermal history of dark matter. In this paper, we build the connection between the present-day velocities and the production mechanism of dark matter and find that the current observation on structure formation can be imposed to constrain the decoupling temperatures and the phase-space distribution of dark matter. We further explore the potential of distinguishing different possible thermal histories of dark matter with hypothetical future observational data. Using the freeze-in/-out scenarios as templates, we find that future precision data may uniquely identify the allowed parameter spaces for freeze-in and freeze-out, or even completely rule out one of the scenarios. This method can be more generally applied to other scenarios.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>A new source for light dark matter isocurvature in low scale inflation</strong>, Andrea Caputo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00056v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.00056v1</a></p>

<p>Light scalar and pseudoscalar particles are compelling dark matter candidates, with a vast running experimental program to discover them. Previous studies have shown that these light fields can generate sizable isocurvature perturbations in high scale inflationary models. Thereby, dark matter existence and cosmic microwave background measurements impose an upper bound on the inflationary scale. In this work, focusing on the axion case, we point out that light fields present during inflation can generate important isocurvature perturbations also in scenarios of low-scale inflation. In our mechanism, the axion field starts with some non-zero field value during inflation and rolls along its potential. Since inflation has a different duration in different patches of the universe, different regions will then have different values of the axion field, generating cold dark matter isocurvature modes. These modes are fully correlated with the adiabatic ones and share the same spectral index. In this scenario, the axion mass determines a lower bound on the Hubble parameter during inflation.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures of a Fuzzy Dark Matter Universe</strong>, Hamed Manouchehri Kousha et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20075v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.20075v1</a></p>

<p>Ultra-light scalar fields and their non-interacting class, the so-called fuzzy dark matter (FDM), are candidates for dark matter, introduced to solve the small-scale problems of the standard cold dark matter. In this paper, we address whether the small-scale effects, specifically the quantum pressure, could leave sizable imprints on the large-scale statistics of the matter. For this purpose, We utilize the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFT of LSS) wherein small-scale physics is integrated and represented on large scales by only a set of free parameters. These parameters can be determined by fitting to the cosmological simulations. We use the \textit{Gadget-2} code to study the evolution of $512^3$ particles in a box of side length $250\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. Fitting EFT predictions to the simulation data, we determine the value of the speed of sound. We use the suppressed FDM initial conditions for the FDM case, sufficient to produce accurate – enough for our purpose – results on large scales. We perform three FDM simulations with different masses and compare their sound speed with the standard cold dark matter (CDM) simulation. We found that the FDM sound speed is slightly higher than CDM’s. The deviation of the sound speed for FDM from CDM is larger for lower FDM masses. We conclude that the impact of the FDM is not limited to the small scales alone, and we can search for them by studying the matter on large scales. Though it is beyond the observations’ scope today, it is possible to discriminate it with upcoming observations.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>Dark Matter Detection with Strongly Correlated Topological Materials: Flatband Effect</strong>, Zhao Huang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19967v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19967v1</a></p>

<p>Dirac materials have been proposed as a new class of electron-based detectors for light dark-matter (DM) scattering or absorption, with predicted sensitivities far exceeding superconductors and superfluid helium. The superiority of Dirac materials originates from a significantly reduced in-medium dielectric response winning over the suppression of DM scattering owing to the limited phase space at the point-like Fermi surface. Here we propose a new route to enhance significantly the DM detection efficiency via strongly correlated topological semimetals. Specifically, by considering a strongly correlated Weyl semimetal model system, we demonstrate that the strong correlation-induced flatband effects can amplify the coupling and detection sensitivity to light DM particles by expanding the scattering phase space, while maintaining a weak dielectric in-medium response.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>Too small to fail: assessing the measurability of sub-solar mass compact object mergers</strong>, Noah E. Wolfe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19907v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19907v1</a></p>

<p>The detection of a sub-solar mass black hole could yield dramatic new insights into the nature of dark matter and early-Universe physics, as such objects lack a traditional astrophysical formation mechanism. Gravitational waves allow for the direct measurement of compact object masses during binary mergers, and we expect the gravitational-wave signal from a low-mass coalescence to remain within the LIGO frequency band for thousands of seconds. However, it is unclear whether one can confidently measure the properties of a sub-solar mass compact object and distinguish between a sub-solar mass black hole or other exotic objects. To this end, we perform Bayesian parameter estimation on simulated gravitational-wave signals from sub-solar mass black hole mergers to explore the measurability of their source properties. We find that the LIGO/Virgo detectors during the O4 observing run would be able to confidently identify sub-solar component masses at the threshold of detectability; these events would also be well-localized on the sky and may reveal some information on their binary spin geometry. Further, next-generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope will allow for precision measurement of the properties of sub-solar mass mergers and tighter constraints on their compact-object nature.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>Axion Topology in Photonic Crystal Domain Walls</strong>, Chiara Devescovi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19805v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19805v1</a></p>

<p>Axion insulators are 3D magnetic higher-order topological insulators protected by inversion-symmetry that exhibit hinge-localized chiral channels and induce quantized topological magnetoelectric effects. Recent research has suggested that axion insulators may be capable of detecting dark-matter axion-like particles by coupling to their axionic excitations. Beyond its fundamental theoretical interest, designing a photonic AXI offers the potential to enable the development of magnetically-tunable photonic switch devices through the manipulation of the axionic modes and their chiral propagation using external magnetic fields. Motivated by these facts, in this work, we propose a novel approach to induce axionic band topology in gyrotropic 3D Weyl photonic crystals gapped by supercell modulation. To quantize an axionic angle, we create domain-walls across inversion-symmetric photonic crystals, incorporating a phase-obstruction in the supercell modulation of their dielectric elements. This allows us to bind chiral channels on inversion-related hinges, ultimately leading to the realization of an axionic chiral channel of light. Moreover, by controlling the material gyrotropic response, we demonstrate a physically accessible way of manipulating the axionic modes through a small external magnetic bias, which provides an effective topological switch between different 1D chiral photonic fiber configurations. Remarkably, the unidirectional axionic hinge states supported by the photonic axion insulator are buried in a fully connected 3D dielectric structure, thereby being protected from radiation through the electromagnetic continuum. As a result, they are highly suitable for applications in guided-light communication, where the preservation and non-reciprocal propagation of photonic signals are of paramount importance.</p>

<p>It is shown that the axion-photon coupling leads to an appearance of time-dependent electric dipole moments of leptons and contributes to electric dipole moments of hadrons. The relation between these moments and the axion-photon coupling constant is rigorously determined. The results obtained open a possibility to compare a sensitivity of search for dark matter axions (and axion-like particles) in optical experiments and experiments with massive particles.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>Quasars: standard candles up to z=7.5 with the precision of Supernovae Ia</strong>, Maria Giovanna Dainotti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19668v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19668v1</a></p>

<p>Currently, the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model, which relies on the existence of cold dark matter and a cosmological constant $\Lambda$, best describes the Universe. However, we lack information in the high-redshift ($z$) region between Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) (up to $z=2.26$) and the Cosmic Microwave Background ($z=1100$), an interval crucial to test cosmological models and their possible evolution. We have defined a sample of 983 Quasars up to $z=7.54$ with reduced intrinsic dispersion $\delta=0.007$ which determines the matter density parameter $\Omega_M$ with the same precision of SNe Ia. Although previous analysis have been used Quasars as cosmological tools (e.g. Risaliti and Lusso 2019), this is the first time that high-redshift sources, in this case Quasars, as standalone cosmological probes yield such tight constraints on $\Omega_M$. Our results show the importance of correcting cosmological relationships for selection biases and redshift evolution and how the choice of a golden sample reduces considerably the intrinsic scatter. This proves the reliability of Quasars as standard cosmological candles.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>On the origin of the evolution of the halo occupation distribution</strong>, Sergio Contreras et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19628v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19628v1</a></p>

<p>We use the TNG300 magneto-hydrodynamic simulation and mock catalogues built using subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) to study the origin of the redshift evolution of the halo occupation distribution (HOD). We analyse stellar-mass selected galaxy samples with fixed number densities, spanning the redshift range $0 \le z \le 3$. We measure their halo occupation functions and fit the HOD parameters to study their evolution over cosmic time. The TNG300 galaxy population strongly depends on the baryonic physics implemented in the simulation. In contrast, the galaxy population predicted by a basic SHAM model without scatter is a direct result of the cosmology of the dark matter simulation. We find that the HOD evolution is similar for both models and is consistent with a previous study of the HOD evolution in semi-analytical models. Specifically, this is the case for the ratio between the characteristic halo masses for hosting central and satellite galaxies. The only HOD parameter whose evolution varies across models is $\sigma_{\rm logM}$, which contains information about the stellar mass-halo mass relation of the galaxies and does not strongly impact galaxy clustering. We also demonstrate that the dependence on the specific values of the cosmological parameters is small. We conclude that the cosmology of the galaxy sample, i.e. the cosmological hierarchical growth of structure, and not the baryonic physics prescriptions, governs the evolution of the HOD for stellar mass-selected samples. These results have important implications for populating simulated lightcones with galaxies and can facilitate the interpretation of clustering data at different redshifts.</p>

<p>Betelgeuse is a well known bright red supergiant that shows semi-regular variations with four approximate periods of 2200, 420, 230, and 185 days. While the longest period was customarily regarded as LSP (long secondary period) of unknown origin, we identify the ~2200-d period as the radial fundamental mode, and the three shorter periods as the radial first, second, and third overtones. From a nonadiabatic pulsation analysis including the pulsation/convection coupling, we have found that these radial pulsation modes are all excited in the envelope of a model in a late stage of the core-carbon burning. Models with similar pulsation property have masses around 11M_\odot (19M_\odot at ZAMS) with luminosities (log L/L_\odot =5.27~5.28) and effective temperatures (log T_{eff}\approx 3.53) that are consistent with the range of the observational determinations. We also find that a synthetic light curve obtained by adding the fundamental and the first-overtone mode qualitatively agrees with the light curve of Betelgeuse up to the Great Dimming. We conclude that Betelgeuse is in the late stage of core carbon burning, and a good candidate for the next Galactic supernova.</p>

<p>We present the early-stage analysis of the low-resolution ($R=1000$) optical spectra and the near-infrared light curves of the bright Type II supernova (SN II) 2023ixf in the notable nearby face-on spiral galaxy M101, which are obtained since $t=1.7$ until $8.0$ d. Our first spectrum shows remarkable emission features of Balmer series, He~{\sc ii}, N~{\sc iv}, and C~{\sc iv} with a strong blue continuum. Compared with SNe II showing the flash-ionized features, we suggest that this SN could be categorized into high-luminosity SNe II with a nitrogen/helium-rich circumstellar material (CSM), e.g., SNe 2014G, 2017ahn, and 2020pni. The H~{$\alpha$} emission line is composed of broad (~2800 km~s$^{-1}$), intermediate (520 km~s$^{-1}$), and narrow ($&lt;200$ km~s$^{-1}$) components. The near-infrared light curves are well consistent with those of another luminous SN II 2017ahn, and the absolute magnitudes locate on the bright end in the lumosity distribution of SNe II. These observational facts support that SN 2023ixf is well consistent with a high-luminosity SN II with the dense nitrogen/helium-rich CSM.</p>

<p>2023-05-31, <strong>Leveraging SN Ia spectroscopic similarity to improve the measurement of $H_0$</strong>, Yukei S. Murakami et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00070v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.00070v1</a></p>

<p>Recent studies suggest spectroscopic differences explain a fraction of the variation in Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities after light-curve/color standardization. In this work, (i) we empirically characterize the variations of standardized SN Ia luminosities, and (ii) we use a spectroscopically inferred parameter, SIP, to improve the precision of SNe Ia along the distance ladder and the determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$). First, we show that the \texttt{Pantheon+} covariance model modestly overestimates the uncertainty of standardized magnitudes by $\sim 7$%, in the parameter space used by the $\texttt{SH0ES}$ Team to measure $H_0$; accounting for this alone yields $H_0 = 73.01 \pm 0.92$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Furthermore, accounting for spectroscopic similarity between SNe~Ia on the distance ladder reduces their relative scatter to $\sim0.12$ mag per object (compared to $\sim 0.14$ mag previously). Combining these two findings in the model of SN covariance, we find an overall 14% reduction (to $\pm 0.85$km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$) of the uncertainty in the Hubble constant and a modest increase in its value. Including a budget for systematic uncertainties itemized by Riess et al. (2022a), we report an updated local Hubble constant with $\sim1.2$% uncertainty, $H_0 = 73.29 \pm 0.90$km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We conclude that spectroscopic differences among photometrically standardized SNe Ia do not explain the ``Hubble tension.” Rather, accounting for such differences increases its significance, as the discrepancy against $\Lambda$CDM calibrated by the ${\it Planck}$ 2018 measurement rises to 5.7$\sigma$.</p>

Palmese et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19914v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.19914v1</a></p>

<p>We present a new constraint on the Hubble constant $H_0$ using the latest measurements of the electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational wave (GW) event GW170817. We use the latest optical, X-ray and radio observations of the afterglow up to $\sim 3.5$ years after the GW detection, and properly take into account the impact of the host galaxy peculiar velocity. We find $75.46^{+5.34}_{-5.39}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (68\% Credible Interval), a $\sim7\%$ precision measurement, which is a significant improvement compared to the $14\%$ precision of the first standard siren measurement. Our result is consistent within $1\sigma$ with the Cepheid-anchored Supernova and within $1.5 \sigma$ with the Cosmic Microwave Background measurements of the Hubble constant. We also explore the impact of the various assumptions made when fitting for the afterglow on the Hubble constant estimate.</p>

<p>We establish a new and cosmological-model-independent method to explore the cosmic background dynamics in this work. Utilizing the latest Pantheon+ type Ia supernova sample and the Hubble parameter measurements, we obtain the values of the Hubble parameter and the deceleration parameter at five different redshift points ranging from 0.2 to 0.6, and find that they can deviate from the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model at more than $2\sigma$. We further probe the equation of state of dark energy and obtain that a slightly oscillating equation of state of dark energy around the $-1$ line is favored.</p>
