<p>2023-06-29, <strong>Cross section for supernova axion observation in neutrino water Cherenkov detectors</strong>, Pierluca Carenza et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17055v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.17055v1</a></p>

<p>Axions coupled to nucleons might be copiously emitted from core-collapse supernovae (SNe). If the axion-nucleon coupling is strong enough, axions would be emitted from the SN as a burst and, reaching Earth, may excite the oxygen nuclei in water Cherenkov detectors (${}^{16}{\rm O} + a \to {}^{16}{\rm O}^{<em>}$). This process will be followed by radiative decay(s) of the excited state (${}^{16}{\rm O}^</em> \rightarrow {}^{16}{\rm O}+\gamma $) providing a strategy for a direct detection of axions from a Galactic SN in large underground neutrino Cherenkov detectors. Motivated by this possibility, we present an updated calculation of axion-oxygen cross section obtained by using self-consistent continuum Random Phase Approximation. We calculate the branching ratio of the oxygen nucleus de-excitation into gamma-rays, neutrons, protons and $\alpha$-particles. These results are used to revisit the detectability of axions from SN 1987A in Kamiokande-II.</p>

<p>2023-06-29, <strong>Astrophysical neutrino oscillations after pulsar timing array analyses</strong>, Gaetano Lambiase et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16977v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16977v1</a></p>

<p>The pattern of neutrino flavor oscillations could be altered by the influence of noisy perturbations such as those arising from a gravitational wave background (GWB). A stochastic process that is consistent with a GWB has been recently reported by the independent analyses of pulsar timing array (PTA) data sets collected over a decadal timescale by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), and the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) collaborations. We investigate the modifications in the neutrino flavor oscillations under the influence of the GWB reported by the PTA collaborations and we discuss how such effects could be potentially revealed in near-future neutrino detectors, possibly helping the discrimination of different models for the GWB below the nHz frequency range.</p>

<p>2023-06-29, <strong>LIME – a gas TPC prototype for directional Dark Matter search for the CYGNO experiment</strong>, Fernando Domingues Amaro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16856v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16856v1</a></p>

<p>The CYGNO experiment aims at the development of a large gaseous TPC with GEM-based amplification and an optical readout by means of PMTs and scientific CMOS cameras for 3D tracking down to O(keV) energies, for the directional detection of rare events such as low mass Dark Matter and solar neutrino interactions. The largest prototype built so far towards the realisation of the CYGNO experiment demonstrator is the 50 L active volume LIME, with 4 PMTs and a single sCMOS imaging a 33$\times$33 cm\textsuperscript{2} area for 50 cm drift, that has been installed in underground Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in February 2022. We will illustrate LIME performances as evaluated overground in Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati by means of radioactive X-ray sources, and in particular the detector stability, energy response and energy resolution. We will discuss the MC simulation developed to reproduce the detector response and show the comparison with actual data. We will furthermore examine the background simulation worked out for LIME underground data taking and illustrate the foreseen expected measurement and results in terms of natural and materials intrinsic radioactivity characterisation and measurement of the LNGS underground natural neutron flux. The results that will be obtained by underground LIME installation will be paramount in the optimisation of the CYGNO demonstrator, since this is foreseen to be composed by multiple modules with the same LIME dimensions and characteristics.</p>

<p>2023-06-29, <strong>Neutrino flares of radio blazars observed from TeV to PeV</strong>, Alisa Suray et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16797v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16797v1</a></p>

<p>Radio blazars have been linked both to individual high-energy neutrino events and to excesses in likelihood sky maps constructed from lower-energy neutrino data. However, the exact mechanism by which neutrinos are produced in these sources is still unknown. Here, we demonstrate that IceCube neutrinos with energies over 200 TeV, which were previously associated with bright radio blazars, are significantly more likely to be accompanied by flares of lower-energy events, compared to those lacking blazar counterparts. The parsec-scale core radio flux of blazars positioned within the error regions of energetic events is strongly correlated with the likelihood of a coincident day-scale lower-energy neutrino flare reported by IceCube. The probability of a chance correlation is 3.6*10^{-4}. This confirms the neutrino-blazar connection in a new and independent way, and provides valuable clues to understanding the origin of astrophysical neutrinos.</p>

<p>2023-06-28, <strong>Exploring resonantly produced mixed sterile neutrino dark matter models</strong>, Emma L. Horner et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16532v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16532v1</a></p>

<p>An unidentified 3.55 keV X-ray line in stacked spectra of galaxies and clusters raises the interesting possibility that it originates from the decay of sterile neutrino dark matter. In this work, we explore mixed sterile neutrino dark matter models that combine cold dark matter and warmer sterile neutrino dark matter produced through lepton number-driven active-to-sterile neutrino transformation. We analyze the sensitivity of the sterile neutrino spectra on active-sterile mixing and on initial neutrino lepton numbers. Furthermore, we assess the viability of these models with estimates of the number of subhalos formed as the host sites of satellite galaxies.</p>

<p>2023-06-28, <strong>New energy spectra in neutrino and photon detectors to reveal hidden dark matter signals</strong>, Wim Beenakker et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16523v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16523v1</a></p>

<p>Neutral particles capable of travelling cosmic distances from a source to detectors on Earth are limited to photons and neutrinos. Examination of the Dark Matter annihilation/decay spectra for these particles reveals the presence of continuum spectra (e.g. due to fragmentation and W or Z decay) and peaks (due to direct annihilations/decays). However, when one explores extensions of the Standard Model (BSM), unexplored spectra emerge that differ significantly from those of the Standard Model (SM) for both neutrinos and photons. In this paper, we argue for the inclusion of important spectra that include peaks as well as previously unexplored entities such as boxes and combinations of box, peak and continuum decay spectra.</p>

<p>2023-06-28, <strong>The Dark Dimension and the Standard Model Landscape</strong>, Luis A. Anchordoqui et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16491v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16491v1</a></p>

<p>We study the landscape of lower-dimensional vacua of the SM coupled to gravity in the presence of the ``dark dimension’’ of size $R_\perp$ in the micron range, focusing on the validity of the swampland conjecture forbidding the presence of non-SUSY AdS vacua in a consistent quantum gravity theory. We first adopt the working assumption that right-handed neutrinos propagate in the bulk, so that neutrino Yukawa couplings become tiny due to a volume suppression, leading to naturally light Dirac neutrinos. We show that the neutrino KK towers compensate for the graviton tower to maintain stable dS vacua found in the past, but neutrino oscillation data set restrictive bounds on $R_\perp$ and therefore the first KK neutrino mode is too heavy to alter the shape of the radon potential or the required maximum mass for the lightest neutrino to carry dS rather than AdS vacua found in the absence of the dark dimension, $m_{1,{\rm max}}\lesssim 7.63~{\rm meV}$. We also show that a very light gravitino (with mass in the meV range) could help relax the neutrino mass constraint $m_{1,{\rm max}} \lesssim 50~{\rm meV}$. The differences for the predicted total neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$ among these two scenarios are within reach of next-generation cosmological probes that may measure the total neutrino mass with an uncertainty $\sigma (\sum m_\nu) = 0.014~{\rm eV}$. We also demonstrate that the KK tower of a very light gravitino can compensate for the graviton tower to sustain stable dS vacua and thus right-handed neutrinos can (in principle) be locked on the brane. For this scenario, Majorana neutrinos could develop dS vacua, which is not possible in the SM coupled to gravity. Finally, we investigate the effects of bulk neutrino masses in suppressing oscillations of the 0-modes into the first KK modes to relax the oscillation bound on $R_\perp$.</p>

<p>2023-06-28, <strong>Influence of local structure on relic neutrino abundances and anisotropies</strong>, Fabian Zimmer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16444v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16444v1</a></p>

<p>Gravitational potentials of the Milky Way and extragalactic structures can influence the propagation of the cosmic neutrino background (CNB). Of particular interest to future CNB observatories, such as PTOLEMY, is the CNB number density on Earth. In this study, we have developed a simulation framework that maps the trajectories of relic neutrinos as they move through the local gravitational environment. The potentials are based on the dark matter halos found in state-of-the-art cosmological N-body simulations, resulting in a more nuanced and realistic input than the previously employed analytical models. We find that the complex dark matter distributions, along with their dynamic evolution, influence the abundance and anisotropies of the CNB in ways unaccounted for by earlier analytical methods. Importantly, these cosmological simulations contain multiple instances of Milky Way-like halos that we employ to model a variety of gravitational landscapes. Consequently, we notice a variation in the CNB number densities that can be primarily attributed to the differences in the masses of these individual halos. For neutrino masses between $0.01$ and $0.3$ eV, we note clustering factors within the range of $1+\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ to $1+\mathcal{O}(1)$. Furthermore, the asymmetric nature of the underlying dark matter distributions within the halos results in not only overdense, but intriguingly, underdense regions within the full-sky anisotropy maps. Gravitational clustering appears to have a significant impact on the angular power spectra of these maps, leading to orders of magnitude more power on smaller scales beyond multipoles of $\ell = 3$ when juxtaposed against predictions by primordial fluctuations. We discuss how our results reshape our understanding of relic neutrino clustering and how this might affect observability of future CNB observatories such as PTOLEMY.</p>

<p>2023-06-28, <strong>Setting an upper limit for the total TeV neutrino flux from the disk of our Galaxy</strong>, Vittoria Vecchiotti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16305v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16305v1</a></p>

<p>We set an upper limit for the total TeV neutrino flux expected from the disk of our Galaxy in the region $|l|&lt;30^{\circ}$ and $|b|&lt;2^{\circ}$ probed by the ANTARES experiment. We include both the diffuse emission, due to the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium, and the possible contribution produced by gamma-ray Galactic sources. The neutrino diffuse emission is calculated under different assumptions for the cosmic ray spatial and energy distribution in our Galaxy. In particular, we assume that the total gamma-ray flux produced by all the sources, resolved and unresolved by H.E.S.S., is produced via hadronic interaction and, hence, is coupled with neutrino emission. We compare our total neutrino flux with the recent ANTARES measurement of the neutrino from the Galactic Ridge. We show that the ANTARES best-fit flux requires the existence of a large source component, close to or even larger than the most optimistic predictions obtained with our approach.</p>

<p>2023-06-28, <strong>A Pythagoras-like theorem for CP violation in neutrino oscillations</strong>, Shu Luo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16231v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16231v1</a></p>

<p>It is well known that the golden appearance channels of neutrino oscillations are $\nu^{}_{\mu} \to \nu^{}_{e}$ and $\overline{\nu}^{}_{\mu} \to \overline{\nu}^{}_{e}$, and their probabilities in vacuum are determined by three CP-conserving flavor mixing factors ${\cal R}^{}_{ij} \equiv {\rm Re} (U^{}_{\mu i} U^{}_{e j} U^{<em>}_{\mu j} U^{</em>}_{e i})$ and the universal Jarlskog invariant of CP violation ${\cal J}^{}_{\nu} \equiv (-1)^{i+j} {\rm Im} (U^{}_{\mu i} U^{}_{e j} U^{<em>}_{\mu j} U^{</em>}_{e i})$ (for $i, j = 1, 2, 3$ and $i &lt; j$) with $U$ being the $3 \times 3$ Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix. We show that the magnitude of ${\cal J}^{}_{\nu}$ can be calculated from ${\cal J}^{2}_{\nu} = {\cal R}^{}_{12} {\cal R}^{}_{13} + {\cal R}^{}_{12} {\cal R}^{}_{23} + {\cal R}^{}_{13} {\cal R}^{}_{23}$ which holds as a natural consequence of the unitarity of $U$, and this Pythagoras-like relation provides a novel cross-check of the result of ${\cal J}^{}_{\nu}$ that will be directly measured in the next-generation $\nu^{}_{\mu} \to \nu^{}_{e}$ and $\overline{\nu}^{}_{\mu} \to \overline{\nu}^{}_{e}$ oscillation experiments. Terrestrial matter effects on ${\cal J}^{}_{\nu}$ and ${\cal R}^{}_{ij}$ are also discussed.</p>

<p>2023-06-28, <strong>Diffuse neutrino background from past core-collapse supernovae</strong>, Shin’ichiro Ando et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16076v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16076v1</a></p>

<p>Core-collapse supernovae are among the most powerful explosions in the universe, emitting thermal neutrinos that carry away the majority of the gravitational binding energy released. These neutrinos create a diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB), one of the largest energy budgets among all radiation backgrounds. Detecting the DSNB is a crucial goal of modern high-energy astrophysics and particle physics, providing valuable insights in both core-collapse modeling, neutrino physics, and cosmic supernova rate history. In this review, we discuss the key ingredients of DSNB calculation and what we can learn from future detections, including black-hole formation and non-standard neutrino interactions. Additionally, we provide an overview of the latest updates in neutrino experiments, which could lead to the detection of the DSNB in the next decade. With the promise of this breakthrough discovery on the horizon, the study of DSNB holds enormous potential for advancing our understanding of the Universe.</p>

<p>2023-06-28, <strong>Neutrino spectrum and energy loss rates due to weak processes on hot $^{56}$Fe in pre-supernova environment</strong>, Alan A. Dzhioev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16055v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.16055v1</a></p>

<p>Applying TQRPA calculations of Gamow–Teller strength functions in hot nuclei, we compute the (anti)neutrino spectra and energy loss rates arising from weak processes on hot $^{56}$Fe under pre-supernova conditions. We use a realistic pre-supernova model calculated by the stellar evolution code MESA. Taking into account both charged and neutral current processes, we demonstrate that weak reactions with hot nuclei can produce high-energy (anti)neutrinos. We also show that, for hot nuclei, the energy loss via (anti)neutrino emission is significantly larger than that for nuclei in their ground state. It is found that the neutral current de-excitation via the $\nu\bar\nu$-pair emission is presumably a dominant source of antineutrinos. In accordance with other studies, we confirm that the so-called single-state approximation for neutrino spectra might fail under certain pre-supernova conditions. }</p>

<p>2023-06-28, <strong>Anomaly induced cooling of Neutron Stars: A Standard Model contribution</strong>, Sabyasachi Chakraborty et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15872v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.15872v1</a></p>

<p>Young neutron stars cool via the emission of neutrinos from their core. A precise understanding of all the different processes producing neutrinos in the hot and degenerate matter is essential for assessing the cooling rate of such stars. The main Standard Model processes contributing to this effect are $\nu$ bremsstrahlung, mURCA among others. In this paper, we investigate another Standard Model process initiated by the Wess-Zumino-Witten term, leading to the emission of neutrino pairs via $N\gamma\to N\nu\bar\nu$. We find that such processes, with degenerate neutrons, can be comparable and even dominate over the prototypical and well-known cooling mechanisms.</p>

<p>2023-06-28, <strong>Evaluating Portable Parallelization Strategies for Heterogeneous Architectures in High Energy Physics</strong>, Mohammad Atif et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15869v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.15869v1</a></p>

<p>High-energy physics (HEP) experiments have developed millions of lines of code over decades that are optimized to run on traditional x86 CPU systems. However, we are seeing a rapidly increasing fraction of floating point computing power in leadership-class computing facilities and traditional data centers coming from new accelerator architectures, such as GPUs. HEP experiments are now faced with the untenable prospect of rewriting millions of lines of x86 CPU code, for the increasingly dominant architectures found in these computational accelerators. This task is made more challenging by the architecture-specific languages and APIs promoted by manufacturers such as NVIDIA, Intel and AMD. Producing multiple, architecture-specific implementations is not a viable scenario, given the available person power and code maintenance issues.   The Portable Parallelization Strategies team of the HEP Center for Computational Excellence is investigating the use of Kokkos, SYCL, OpenMP, std::execution::parallel and alpaka as potential portability solutions that promise to execute on multiple architectures from the same source code, using representative use cases from major HEP experiments, including the DUNE experiment of the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility, and the ATLAS and CMS experiments of the Large Hadron Collider. This cross-cutting evaluation of portability solutions using real applications will help inform and guide the HEP community when choosing their software and hardware suites for the next generation of experimental frameworks. We present the outcomes of our studies, including performance metrics, porting challenges, API evaluations, and build system integration.</p>

<p>2023-06-29, <strong>Probing the Dark Matter density with gravitational waves from super-massive binary black holes</strong>, Anish Ghoshal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17158v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.17158v1</a></p>

<p>Supermassive black hole binaries source gravitational waves measured by Pulsar Timing Arrays. The frequency spectrum of this stochastic background is predicted more precisely than its amplitude. We argue that Dark Matter friction can suppress the spectrum around nHz frequencies, where it is measured, allowing to derive robust and significant bounds on the Dark Matter density, which, in turn, controls indirect detection signals from galactic centers. A precise spectrum of gravitational waves would translate in a tomography of the DM density profile, potentially probing DM particle-physics effects that induce a characteristic DM density profile, such as DM annihilations or de Broglie wavelength.</p>

<p>Recently, the NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA and CPTA collaborations reported compelling evidence of the existence of the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). The amplitude and spectrum of this inferred gravitational-wave background align closely with the astrophysical predictions for a signal originating from the population of supermassive black-hole binaries. In light of these findings, we explore the possibility to detect dark matter spikes surrounding massive black holes, which could potentially impact the gravitational-wave waveform and modulate the SGWB. We demonstrate that the SMBH binary evolution induced by the combined effects of GW radiation and the dynamical friction of the dark matter spike exhibits detectable manifestations within the nHz frequency range of the SGWB.</p>

<p>For the typical forbidden dark matter (DM), the correct relic density is determined exclusively by kinetically forbidden DM annihilations which vanish at zero temperature. We present a model that contains the DM and a heavier but unstable scalar mediator in the hidden sector. When the temperature drops below $\sim m_{\rm DM}$, this hidden sector, thermally decoupled from the visible sector, enters a cannibal phase (with zero chemical potential), during which the DM density is depleted with the out-of-equilibrium decay of the scalar mediator. As such, the freeze-out process, described by forbidden DM annihilations to mediators, evolves with a temperature different from the SM bath. The DM candidate of having a mass in the range of tens of MeV can result in the correct relic density and sizable 2-to-2 self-interactions, which fit small structure problems. The future sensitivity of the NA62 beam dump experiment can probe the parameter space of the related scalar mediator.</p>

<p>The NANOGrav Collaboration has recently announced evidence for nHz gravitational waves (GWs), in the form of a Hellings-Downs angular correlation in the common-spectrum process that had been observed previously by them and other Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). We analyze the possibility that these GWs originate from binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with total masses $\gtrsim 10^9\, M_{\odot}$. The spectral index of the GW signal differs at 95 % CL from that predicted for binary evolution by GW emission alone, and we find $&gt; 3 \sigma$ evidence that environmental effects such as dynamical friction with gas, stars, and dark matter may be affecting the binary evolution. We estimate the required magnitude and spectrum of such environmental effects and comment on their possible implications for measurements of GWs at higher frequencies.</p>

<p>The self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) paradigm provides a potential solution to the challenge faced by the cold dark matter model in explaining small-scale structure problems. This paradigm incorporates self-interactions among DM particles, typically mediated by a particle with a mass around MeV. The recent evidences of nano-Hertz gravitational waves from NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA, and CPTA collaborations indicate a first-order phase transition (FOPT) occurring at a temperature of the MeV scale. Considering the close proximity between these two scales, we postulate that the mediator mass in the SIDM model originates from the spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)’$ symmetry, which is driven by the FOPT indicated by pulsar time array data. Consequently, the alignment of these two scales is believed to be deeply connected by the same underlying physics. Through a comprehensive survey of the parameter space, we identify the viable region favored by SIDM and simultaneously provide an explanation for the pulsar timing array data.</p>

<p>We study the long-term evolution of the Milky Way (MW) over cosmic time by modeling the star formation, cosmic rays, metallicity, stellar dynamics, outflows and inflows of the galactic system to obtain various insights into the galactic evolution. The mass accretion is modeled by the results of cosmological $N$-body simulations for the cold dark matter. We find that the star formation rate is about half the mass accretion rate of the disk, given the consistency between observed Galactic Diffuse X-ray Emissions (GDXEs) and possible conditions driving the Galactic wind. Our model simultaneously reproduces the quantities of star formation rate, cosmic rays, metals, and the rotation curve of the current MW. The most important predictions of the model are that there is an unidentified accretion flow with a possible number density of $\sim10^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$ and the part of the GDXEs originates from a hot, diffuse plasma which is formed by consuming about 10 % of supernova explosion energy. The latter is the science case for future X-ray missions; XRISM, Athena, and so on. We also discuss further implications of our results for the planet formation and observations of externalgalaxies in terms of the multimessenger astronomy.</p>

<p>Theoretical and observational challenges to standard cosmology such as the cosmological constant problem and tensions between cosmological model parameters inferred from different observations motivate the development and search of new physics. A less radical approach to venturing beyond the standard model is the simple mathematical reformulation of our theoretical frameworks underlying it. While leaving physical measurements unaffected, this can offer a reinterpretation and even solutions of these problems. In this spirit, metric transformations are performed here that cast our Universe into different geometries. Of particular interest thereby is the formulation of cosmology in Minkowski space. Rather than an expansion of space, spatial curvature, and small-scale inhomogeneities and anisotropies, this frame exhibits a variation of mass, length and time scales across spacetime. Alternatively, this may be interpreted as an evolution of fundamental constants. As applications of this reframed cosmological picture, the naturalness of the cosmological constant is reinspected and promising candidates of geometric origin are explored for dark matter, dark energy, inflation and baryogenesis. An immediate observation thereby is the apparent absence of the cosmological constant problem in the Minkowski frame. The formalism is also applied to identify new observable signatures of conformal inhomogeneities, which have been proposed as simultaneous solution of the observational tensions in the Hubble constant, the amplitude of matter fluctuations, and the gravitational lensing amplitude of cosmic microwave background anisotropies. These are found to enhance redshifts to distant galaxy clusters and introduce a mass bias with cluster masses inferred from gravitational lensing exceeding those inferred kinematically or dynamically.</p>

<p>Recent independent announcements by several collaborations have shown strong evidence of a Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB) detected through Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). In this study, we investigate the implications of a first-order phase transition occurring within the early universe’s dark quantum chromodynamics (dQCD) epoch, specifically within the framework of the mirror twin Higgs dark sector model. Our analysis indicates a distinguishable SGWB signal originating from this phase transition, which can explain the measurements obtained by PTAs. Remarkably, a significant portion of the parameter space within the mirror twin Higgs model that accounts for the SGWB signal also effectively resolves the existing tensions in both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ measurements in Cosmology. This intriguing correlation suggests a possible common origin for these three phenomena. Furthermore, the parameter region, $0.2 &lt; \Delta N_{\rm eff} &lt; 0.5$, where the mirror dark matter component constitutes less than $30\%$ of the total dark matter abundance, can accommodate all current cosmological observations and PTA measurements.</p>

<p>In this work we study the autonomous dynamical system of different $F(R)$ models in the formalism of holographic dark energy using the generalized Nojiri-Odintsov cut-off. We explicitly give the expression of the fixed points as functions of the infrared cut-off for vacuum $F(R)$ gravity in flat and non-flat FRW background and for $F(R)$ coupling axion dark matter. Each fixed point component can be taken as a condition on the cut-off and on the expression of $F(R)$, leading to physically interesting constraints on these functions.</p>

<p>Atom gradiometers have emerged as compelling broadband probes of scalar ultralight dark matter (ULDM) candidates that oscillate with frequencies between approximately $10^{-2}$ Hz and $10^3$ Hz. ULDM signals with frequencies greater than $\sim 1$ Hz exceed the expected Nyquist frequency of atom gradiometers, and so are affected by aliasing and related phenomena, including signal folding and spectral distortion. To facilitate the discovery of super-Nyquist ULDM signals, in this work we investigate the impact of these effects on parameter reconstruction using a robust likelihood-based framework. We demonstrate that accurate reconstruction of ULDM parameters can be achieved as long as the experimental frequency resolution is larger than the ULDM signal linewidth. Notably, as ULDM candidates whose frequencies differ by integer multiples of the sampling frequency are identified at the same aliased frequency, our discovery analysis recovers discrete islands in parameter space. Our study represents the first comprehensive exploration of aliasing in the context of dark matter direct detection and paves the way for enhanced ULDM detection strategies with atom gradiometers.</p>

<p>In a broad class of theories, the accumulation of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) with particles of mass $10^{-22}~\textrm{eV} &lt; m_{\phi} &lt; 1~\textrm{eV}$ leads the to formation of long-lived bound states known as boson stars. When the ULDM exhibits self-interactions, prodigious bursts of energy carried by relativistic bosons are released from collapsing boson stars in bosenova explosions. We extensively explore the potential reach of terrestrial and space-based experiments for detecting transient signatures of emitted relativistic bursts of scalar particles, including ULDM coupled to photons, electrons, and gluons, capturing a wide range of motivated theories. For the scenario of relaxion ULDM, we demonstrate that upcoming experiments and technology such as nuclear clocks as well as space-based interferometers will be able to sensitively probe orders of magnitude in the ULDM coupling-mass parameter space, challenging to study otherwise, by detecting signatures of transient bosenova events. Our analysis can be readily extended to different scenarios of relativistic scalar particle emission.</p>

<p>Xenon dual-phase time projections chambers (TPCs) have proven to be a successful technology in studying physical phenomena that require low-background conditions. With 40t of liquid xenon (LXe) in the TPC baseline design, DARWIN will have a high sensitivity for the detection of particle dark matter, neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$), and axion-like particles (ALPs). Although cosmic muons are a source of background that cannot be entirely eliminated, they may be greatly diminished by placing the detector deep underground. In this study, we used Monte Carlo simulations to model the cosmogenic background expected for the DARWIN observatory at four underground laboratories: Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS), Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM) and SNOLAB. We determine the production rates of unstable xenon isotopes and tritium due to muon-included neutron fluxes and muon-induced spallation. These are expected to represent the dominant contributions to cosmogenic backgrounds and thus the most relevant for site selection.</p>

<p>Numerous observations have shown that almost all galaxies in our Universe host supermassive black holes (SMBHs), but there is still much debate about their formation and evolutionary processes. Recently, gravitational waves (GWs) have been expected to be a new and important informative observation, in particular, in the low-frequency region by making use of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). As an evolutionary process of the SMBHs, we revisit a dark matter (DM) halo-SMBH coevolution model based on the halo merger tree employing an ansatz for the mass relation between the DM halos and the SMBHs at $z=6$. In this model, the mass of SMBHs grows through their mergers associated with the halo mergers, and hence the evolutionary information must be stored in the GWs emitted at the mergers. We investigate the stochastic gravitational background from the coalescing SMBH binaries, which the PTAs can detect, and also the GW bursts emitted at the mergers, which can be detected by the mHz band observations such as LISA. We also discuss the possibility of probing the mass relation between the DM halos and the SMBHs at high redshift by future GW observations.</p>

<p>Pulsar Timing Array experiments probe the presence of possible scalar/pseudoscalar ultralight dark matter particles through decade-long timing of an ensemble of galactic millisecond radio pulsars. With the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array, we focus on the most robust scenario, in which dark matter interacts only gravitationally with ordinary baryonic matter. Our results show that ultralight particles with masses $10^{-24.0}~\text{eV} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-23.2}~\text{eV}$ cannot constitute $100\%$ of the measured local dark matter density, but can have at most local density $\rho\lesssim 0.15$ GeV/cm$^3$.</p>

<p>The European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) and Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) collaborations have measured a low-frequency common signal in the combination of their second and first data releases respectively, with the correlation properties of a gravitational wave background (GWB). Such signal may have its origin in a number of physical processes including a cosmic population of inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs); inflation, phase transitions, cosmic strings and tensor mode generation by non-linear evolution of scalar perturbations in the early Universe; oscillations of the Galactic potential in the presence of ultra-light dark matter (ULDM). At the current stage of emerging evidence, it is impossible to discriminate among the different origins. Therefore, in this paper, we consider each process separately, and investigate the implications of the signal under the hypothesis that it is generated by that specific process. We find that the signal is consistent with a cosmic population of inspiralling SMBHBs, and its relatively high amplitude can be used to place constraints on binary merger timescales and the SMBH-host galaxy scaling relations. If this origin is confirmed, this is the first direct evidence that SMBHBs merge in nature, adding an important observational piece to the puzzle of structure formation and galaxy evolution. As for early Universe processes, the measurement would place tight constraints on the cosmic string tension and on the level of turbulence developed by first-order phase transitions. Other processes would require non-standard scenarios, such as a blue-tilted inflationary spectrum or an excess in the primordial spectrum of scalar perturbations at large wavenumbers. Finally, a ULDM origin of the detected signal is disfavoured, which leads to direct constraints on the abundance of ULDM in our Galaxy.</p>

<p>The 15-year pulsar timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) shows positive evidence for the presence of a low-frequency gravitational-wave (GW) background. In this paper, we investigate potential cosmological interpretations of this signal, specifically cosmic inflation, scalar-induced GWs, first-order phase transitions, cosmic strings, and domain walls. We find that, with the exception of stable cosmic strings of field theory origin, all these models can reproduce the observed signal. When compared to the standard interpretation in terms of inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), many cosmological models seem to provide a better fit resulting in Bayes factors in the range from 10 to 100. However, these results strongly depend on modeling assumptions about the cosmic SMBHB population and, at this stage, should not be regarded as evidence for new physics. Furthermore, we identify excluded parameter regions where the predicted GW signal from cosmological sources significantly exceeds the NANOGrav signal. These parameter constraints are independent of the origin of the NANOGrav signal and illustrate how pulsar timing data provide a new way to constrain the parameter space of these models. Finally, we search for deterministic signals produced by models of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) and dark matter substructures in the Milky Way. We find no evidence for either of these signals and thus report updated constraints on these models. In the case of ULDM, these constraints outperform torsion balance and atomic clock constraints for ULDM coupled to electrons, muons, or gluons.</p>

<p>In the standard model of particle physics, the strong force is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamic (QCD). Based on QCD properties, it is commonly believed that at sufficiently high temperatures or densities, the hadrons are melted into their constituent quarks, i.e., undergo a deconfinement transition to a new phase of quarks and gluons. Such phase is frequently called quark matter or quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Although QGP has been observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, it is currently an open question about the onset of deconfinement. By comparing simulations from a reliable hadron and quark relativistic transport model and recent STAR experimental data, we infer that the onset of hadron-quark phase transition occurs at about fivefold nuclear compression corresponding temperature $T\sim$ 112 MeV and baryon chemical potential $\mu_{B}\sim$ 586 MeV in nuclear matter phase diagram. This finding has important implications for the studies of early and present universe, such as relevant to the fraction of dark matter formed in early universe and structure of neutron stars as well as the dynamics of neutron star mergers.</p>

<p>We quantify the differences between stellar accelerations in disk galaxies formed in a MONDian universe relative to galaxies with the identical baryonic matter distributions and a fitted cold dark matter halo. In a Milky Way-like galaxy the maximal transverse acceleration is ${\cal {O}}(10^{-9})$ arcseconds per year per decade, well beyond even the most optimistic extrapolations of current capabilities. Conversely, the maximum difference in the line-of-sight acceleration is ${\cal {O}}(1)$ centimetre per second per decade at solar distances from the galactic centre. This level of precision is within reach of plausible future instruments.</p>

<p>The Fermi-LAT observations of SN 2023ixf, a Type II supernova in the nearby Pinwheel Galaxy, Messier 101 (M101), presents us with an excellent opportunity to constrain MeV-scale Axion-Like Particles (ALPs). By examining the photon decay signature from heavy ALPs that could be produced in the explosion, we improve the existing constraints on the ALP-photon coupling by up to a factor of $ \sim 2 $ for masses $ m_a \lesssim 3 $ MeV, with the exact value depending mostly on plasma properties of the collapsing core. This study demonstrates the relevance of core-collapse supernovae, also beyond the Magellanic Clouds, as probes of fundamental physics.</p>

<p>Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) independent approaches are frequently used in the literature to provide estimates of Hubble constant ($H_0$). In this work, we report CMB independent constraints on $H_0$ in an anisotropic extension of $\Lambda$CDM model using the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic Chronometer (CC), and Pantheon+ compilation of Type Ia supernovae data. The analyses of the anisotropic model with different combinations of data sets reveal that anisotropy is strongly and positively correlated with $H_0$, and an anisotropy of the order $10^{-14}$ in the anisotropic model yields values of $H_0$ consistent with the direct local measurements.</p>

<p>We develop extreme data compression for use in Bayesian model comparison via the MOPED algorithm, as well as more general score compression. We find that Bayes factors from data compressed with the MOPED algorithm are identical to those from their uncompressed datasets when the models are linear and the errors Gaussian. In other nonlinear cases, whether nested or not, we find negligible differences in the Bayes factors, and show this explicitly for the Pantheon-SH0ES supernova dataset. We also investigate the sampling properties of the Bayesian Evidence as a frequentist statistic, and find that extreme data compression reduces the sampling variance of the Evidence, but has no impact on the sampling distribution of Bayes factors. Since model comparison can be a very computationally-intensive task, MOPED extreme data compression may present significant advantages in computational time.</p>

<p>We examine spatial variations of the C$^0$/CO abundance ratio ($X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$) in the vicinity of the $\gamma$-ray supernova remnant W51C, based on [CI] ($^3P_1$-$^3P_0$), $^{12}$CO(1-0), and $^{13}$CO(1-0) observations with the ASTE and Nobeyama 45-m telescopes. We find that $X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$ varies in a range of 0.02-0.16 (0.05 in median) inside the molecular clouds of $A_V&gt;$100 mag, where photodissociation of CO by the interstellar UV is negligible. Furthermore, $X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$ is locally enhanced up to by a factor of four near the W51C center, depending on the projected distance from the W51C center. In high-$A_V$ molecular clouds, $X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$ is determined by the ratio of the cosmic-ray (CR) ionization rate to the H$_2$ density, and we find no clear spatial variation of the H$_2$ density against the projected distance. Hence, the high CR ionization rate may locally enhance $X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$ near the W51C center. We also find that the observed spatial extent of the enhanced $X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$ ($\sim$17 pc) is consistent with the diffusion distance of CRs with the energy of 100 MeV. The fact suggests that the low-energy CRs accelerated in W51C enhance $X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$. The CR ionization rate at the $X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$-enhanced cloud is estimated to be 3$\times$10$^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ on the basis of time-dependent PDR simulations of $X_{\mathrm{C/CO}}$, the value of which is 30 times higher than that in the standard Galactic environment. These results demonstrate that [CI] is a powerful probe to investigate the interaction between CRs and the interstellar medium for a wide area in the vicinity of supernova remnants.</p>

<p>2023-06-28, <strong>The effects of rotation, metallicity and magnetic field on the islands of failed supernovae</strong>, Lei Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15879v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.15879v1</a></p>

<p>Failed supernovae (FSN) are a possible channel for the formation of heavy stellar-mass black holes ($M_{ BH}&gt;\sim 30$ M$_\odot$). However, the effects of metallicity, rotation and magnetic field on the islands of explodabilty of massive stars are not clear. Here, we simulate the stellar structure and evolution in the mass range between 6 and 55 $M_{\odot}$ with different initial rotational velocities, metallicities, and magnetic fields from zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) to pre-collapse. We find that the rapid rotating stars can remain lower $\rm ^{12}C$ mass fraction at the time of C ignition, which allows the transition, from convective carbon burning to radiative burning, to occur at lower $M_{\rm ZAMS}$ than those from stars without rotation. However, the rapid rotation is unfavorable for FSN occurring but is conducive to long gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs) because it results in the specific angular momentum in the CO core is greater than the last stable orbit at core collapse. The increasing metallicity does not affect FSN islands, but high metallicity inhibits rotational mixing and is unfavorable for producing lGRBs. A magnetic field can constrain the mass-loss rate even for rapid rotating stars, resulting in higher mass at pre-collapse. The magnetic braking triggered by the magnetic field can reduce the rotation velocity for high-metallicity models, which decreases the specific angular momentum in the CO core and is favorable for FSN occurring. We suggest that the heavy-mass black holes detected by LIGO may originate from rapidly rotating massive stars with strong magnetic fields, rather than those with very low metallicity.</p>
