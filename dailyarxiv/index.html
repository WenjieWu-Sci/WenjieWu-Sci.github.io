<p>2023-09-06, <strong>Demonstration of particle tracking with scintillating fibres read out by a SPAD array sensor and application as a neutrino active target</strong>, Matthew Franks et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03131v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03131v1</a></p>

<p>Scintillating fibre detectors combine sub-mm resolution particle tracking, precise measurements of the particle stopping power and sub-ns time resolution. Typically, fibres are read out with silicon photomultipliers (SiPM). Hence, if fibres with a few hundred mm diameter are used, either they are grouped together and coupled with a single SiPM, losing spatial resolution, or a very large number of electronic channels is required. In this article we propose and provide a first demonstration of a novel configuration which allows each individual scintillating fibre to be read out regardless of the size of its diameter, by imaging them with Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) array sensors. Differently from SiPMs, SPAD array sensors provide single-photon detection with single-pixel spatial resolution. In addition, O(us) or faster coincidence of detected photons allows to obtain noise-free images. Such a concept can be particularly advantageous if adopted as a neutrino active target, where scintillating fibres alternated along orthogonal directions can provide isotropic, high-resolution tracking in a dense material and reconstruct the kinematics of low-momentum protons (down to 150 MeV/c), crucial for an accurate characterisation of the neutrino nucleus cross section. In this work the tracking capabilities of a bundle of scintillating fibres coupled to SwissSPAD2 is demonstrated. The impact of such detector configuration in GeV-neutrino experiments is studied with simulations and reported. Finally, future plans, including the development of a new SPAD array sensor optimised for neutrino detection, are discussed.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>The Spectra of IceCube Neutrino (SIN) candidate sources – IV. Spectral energy distributions and multi-wavelength variability</strong>, Martina Karl et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03119v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03119v1</a></p>

<p>We present hybrid spectral energy distributions, combining photon and neutrino fluxes, for a sample of blazars, which are candidate IceCube neutrino sources. We furthermore check for differences in our sources’ variability in the near-infrared, optical, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands compared to a sample of non-neutrino source candidate blazars, and investigate the state of each blazar at the arrival time of high-energy neutrinos. We find no significant differences when comparing our sample with control sources, also in terms of their spectral energy distributions, and no correlation between flaring states and neutrino arrival times. Looking for signatures of hadronic production, we check for similar strengths of the $\gamma$-ray and neutrino fluxes and find a $2.2\,\sigma$ signal for our source candidates. The hybrid spectral energy distributions assembled here will form the basis of the next step of our project, namely lepto-hadronic modelling of these blazars to assess the physical likelihood of a neutrino connection.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>Correlating high-energy IceCube neutrinos with 5BZCAT blazars and RFC sources</strong>, Chiara Bellenghi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03115v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03115v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the possibility that blazars in the Roma-BZCAT Multifrequency Catalogue of Blazars (5BZCAT) are sources of the high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, as recently suggested by Buson et al. (2022a,b). Although we can reproduce their $\sim 4.6\, \sigma$ result, which applies to 7 years of neutrino data in the Southern sky, we find no significant correlation with 5BZCAT sources when extending the search to the Northern sky, where IceCube is most sensitive to astrophysical signals. To further test this scenario, we use a larger sample consisting of 10 years of neutrino data recently released by the IceCube collaboration, this time finding no significant correlation in either the Southern or the Northern sky. These results suggest that the strong correlation reported by Buson et al. (2022a,b) using 5BZCAT could be due to a statistical fluctuation and possibly the spatial and flux non-uniformities in the blazar sample. We perform some additional correlation tests using the more uniform, flux-limited, and blazar-dominated Radio Fundamental Catalogue (RFC) and find a $\sim 3.2\sigma$ equivalent p-value when correlating it with the 7-year Southern neutrino sky. However, this correlation disappears completely when extending the analysis to the Northern sky and when analyzing 10 years of all-sky neutrino data. Our findings support a scenario where the contribution of the whole blazar class to the IceCube signal is relevant but not dominant, in agreement with most previous studies.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>Prospects for combined analyses of hadronic emission from $γ$-ray sources in the Milky Way with CTA and KM3NeT</strong>, T. Unbehaun et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03007v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03007v1</a></p>

<p>The Cherenkov Telescope Array and the KM3NeT neutrino telescopes are major upcoming facilities in the fields of $\gamma$-ray and neutrino astronomy, respectively. Possible simultaneous production of $\gamma$ rays and neutrinos in astrophysical accelerators of cosmic-ray nuclei motivates a combination of their data. We assess the potential of a combined analysis of CTA and KM3NeT data to determine the contribution of hadronic emission processes in known Galactic $\gamma$-ray emitters, comparing this result to the cases of two separate analyses. In doing so, we demonstrate the capability of Gammapy, an open-source software package for the analysis of $\gamma$-ray data, to also process data from neutrino telescopes. For a selection of prototypical $\gamma$-ray sources within our Galaxy, we obtain models for primary proton and electron spectra in the hadronic and leptonic emission scenario, respectively, by fitting published $\gamma$-ray spectra. Using these models and instrument response functions for both detectors, we employ the Gammapy package to generate pseudo data sets, where we assume 200 hours of CTA observations and 10 years of KM3NeT detector operation. We then apply a three-dimensional binned likelihood analysis to these data sets, separately for each instrument and jointly for both. We find that the largest benefit of the combined analysis lies in the possibility of a consistent modelling of the $\gamma$-ray and neutrino emission. Assuming a purely leptonic scenario as input, we obtain, for the most favourable source, an average expected 68% credible interval that constrains the contribution of hadronic processes to the observed $\gamma$-ray emission to below 15%.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>Traceless Texture of Neutrino Mass Matrix</strong>, N. Chamoun et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03001v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03001v1</a></p>

<p>We study a neutrino mass matrix texture characterized by a vanishing trace. We highlight the role played by the phases, physical and non-physical, and undergo a thorough phenomenological analysis, first (second) when the non-physical (CP) phases are vanishing, then move on to the general case where all phases exist. Finally we present a theoretical realization of the texture based on $A_5$ non-abelian flavor symmetry.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>When Energy Goes Missing: New Physics in $b\to sνν$ with Sterile Neutrinos</strong>, Tobias Felkl et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02940v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.02940v1</a></p>

<p>Belle II recently reported the first measurement of $B^+\to K^++\mathrm{inv}$, which is $2.8\sigma$ above the Standard Model prediction. We explore the available parameter space of new physics within Standard Model effective field theory extended by sterile neutrinos ($\nu$SMEFT) and provide predictions for the other $B\to K^{(\star)}+\mathrm{inv}$ decay modes and invisible $B_s$ decays. We also briefly comment on charged current decays $B\to D^{(\star)}\ell\bar\nu$ and possible ultraviolet completions of the relevant $\nu$SMEFT operators.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>Stochastic modelling of cosmic ray sources for diffuse high-energy gamma-rays and neutrinos</strong>, Anton Stall et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02860v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.02860v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmic rays of energies up to a few PeV are believed to be of galactic origin, yet individual sources have still not been firmly identified. Due to inelastic collisions with the interstellar gas, cosmic-ray nuclei produce a diffuse flux of high-energy gamma-rays and neutrinos. Fermi-LAT has provided maps of galactic gamma-rays at GeV energies which can be produced by both hadronic and leptonic processes. Neutrinos, on the other hand, are exclusively produced by the sought-after hadronic processes, yet they can be detected above backgrounds only at hundreds of TeV. Oftentimes, diffuse emission maps are extrapolated from GeV to PeV energies, but the sources contributing at either energies likely differ. We have modelled the production of diffuse emission from GeV through PeV energies in a Monte Carlo approach, taking into consideration the discrete nature of sources. We can generate realisations of the diffuse sky in a matter of seconds, thus allowing for characterising correlations in direction and energy. At hundreds of TeV, relevant for observations with LHAASO, Tibet AS-gamma, IceCube and the upcoming SWGO, variations between different realisations are sizeable. Specifically, we show that extrapolations of diffuse emission from GeV to PeV energies must fail and apply our results on the recent experimental findings.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>Atomic electron shell excitations in double-$β$ decay</strong>, M. I. Krivoruchenko et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02850v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.02850v1</a></p>

<p>The problem of the transition of electron shells of atoms to excited states in the process of neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay is investigated. This subject is crucial for modeling the energy spectrum of $\beta$-electrons, which is sensitive to the mass and Majorana nature of neutrinos. The dependence of the obtained results on the atomic number indicates the determining role of the Feinberg–Migdal effect in the electron shell excitations. We report the overlap amplitudes of the electron shells of the parent atom and the daughter ion for eleven atoms, the two-neutrino double-$\beta$ decay of which was observed experimentally. In around one-fourth of the cases where the structure of the electron shells is inherited from the parent atom, there is a transition to the ground state or the excited state with the lowest energy. The de-excitation of the daughter ion in the latter scenario is accompanied by the emission of photons in the ultraviolet range, which can serve as an auxiliary signature of double-$\beta$ decay. The average excitation energy of the electron shells ranges between 300 and 800 eV, with the variance ranging from $(1.7~\mathrm{keV})^2$ in calcium to $(14~\mathrm{keV})^2$ in uranium.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>General Heavy WIMP Nucleon Elastic Scattering</strong>, Qing Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02715v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.02715v1</a></p>

<p>Heavy WIMP (weakly-interacting-massive-particle) effective field theory is used to compute the WIMP-nucleon scattering rate for general heavy electroweak multiplets through order $m_W/M$, where $m_W$ and $M$ denote the electroweak and WIMP mass scales. The lightest neutral component of such an electroweak multiplet is a candidate dark matter particle, either elementary or composite. Existing computations for certain representations of electroweak $\mathrm{SU(2)}_W\times \mathrm{U(1)}_Y$ reveal a cancellation of amplitudes from different effective operators at leading and subleading orders in $1/M$, yielding small cross sections that are below current dark matter direct detection experimental sensitivities. We extend those computations and consider all low-spin (spin-0, spin-1/2, spin-1, spin-3/2) heavy electroweak multiplets with arbitrary $\mathrm{SU(2)}_W\times \mathrm{U(1)}_Y$ representations and provide benchmark cross section results for dark matter direct detection experiments. For most self-conjugate TeV WIMPs with isospin $\le 3$, the cross sections are below current experimental limits but within reach of next-generation experiments. An exception is the case of pure electroweak doublet, where WIMPs are hidden below the neutrino floor.</p>

<p>2023-09-05, <strong>Collisional flavor swap with neutrino self-interactions</strong>, Chinami Kato et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02619v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.02619v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinos play pivotal roles in determining fluid dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and their observables in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) and binary neutron star merger (BNSM). In this Letter, we present a novel phenomenon, collisional flavor swap, in which neutrino-matter interactions trigger the complete interchange of neutrino spectra between two different flavors, aided by neutrino self-interactions. We find a necessary condition to trigger the collisional swap is occurrences of resonance-like collisional flavor instability. After the collisional swap, spectral-swap like features emerge in neutrino spectra. Since flavor swaps correspond to the most extreme case in flavor conversions, they have a great potential to affect CCSN and BNSM phenomena.</p>

<p>2023-09-05, <strong>EUSO-OffLine: A Comprehensive Simulation and Analysis Framework</strong>, The JEM-EUSO collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02577v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.02577v1</a></p>

<p>The complexity of modern cosmic ray observatories and the rich data sets they capture often require a sophisticated software framework to support the simulation of physical processes, detector response, as well as reconstruction and analysis of real and simulated data. Here we present the EUSO-OffLine framework. The code base was originally developed by the Pierre Auger Collaboration, and portions of it have been adopted by other collaborations to suit their needs. We have extended this software to fulfill the requirements of UHECR detectors and VHE neutrino detectors developed for the JEM-EUSO. These path-finder instruments constitute a program to chart the path to a future space-based mission like POEMMA. For completeness, we describe the overall structure of the framework developed by the Pierre Auger collaboration and continue with a description of the JEM-EUSO simulation and reconstruction capabilities. The framework is written predominantly in modern C++ and incorporates third-party libraries chosen based on functionality and our best judgment regarding support and longevity. Modularity is a central notion in the framework design, a requirement for large collaborations in which many individuals contribute to a common code base and often want to compare different approaches to a given problem. For the same reason, the framework is designed to be highly configurable, which allows us to contend with a variety of JEM-EUSO missions and observation scenarios. We also discuss how we incorporate broad, industry-standard testing coverage which is necessary to ensure quality and maintainability of a relatively large code base, and the tools we employ to support a multitude of computing platforms and enable fast, reliable installation of external packages. Finally, we provide a few examples of simulation and reconstruction applications using EUSO-OffLine.</p>

<p>2023-09-05, <strong>Nucleon axial-vector radius and form factor from future neutrino experiments</strong>, Roberto Petti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02509v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.02509v1</a></p>

<p>Precision measurements of antineutrino elastic scattering on hydrogen from future neutrino experiments offer a unique opportunity to access the low-energy structure of protons and neutrons. We discuss the determination of the nucleon axial-vector form factor and radius from antineutrino interactions on hydrogen which can be collected at the future Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF), and study the sources of theoretical and experimental uncertainties. The projected accuracy would improve existing measurements by one order of magnitude and be competitive with contemporary lattice-QCD determinations, potentially helping to resolve the corresponding tension with measurements from (anti)neutrino elastic scattering on deuterium. We find that the current knowledge of the nucleon vector form factors could be one of the dominant sources of uncertainty. We also evaluate the constraints which can be simultaneously obtained on the absolute $\bar \nu_\mu$ flux normalization.</p>

<p>2023-09-05, <strong>Majorana neutrinos in the triple gauge boson coupling $ZZZ^*$</strong>, Héctor Novales-Sánchez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02400v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.02400v1</a></p>

<p>Confirmed by the measurement of neutrino oscillations, neutrino mass is recognized as a genuine manifestation of physics beyond the Standard Model, while its originating mechanism remains a mystery. Moreover, the proper field-theory description of neutrinos, whether they are Majorana or Dirac type, must be linked to such a mechanism. The present work addresses the calculation, estimation, and analysis of one-loop contributions from virtual Majorana neutrinos, light and heavy as well, to the neutral gauge boson coupling $ZZZ$, which participates in $Z$-boson pair production from $e^+e^-$ collisions. This task is carried out in the framework defined by a seesaw variant in which light neutrinos remain massless at tree level, then becoming massive radiatively. The $ZZZ^<em>$ coupling, with $Z^</em>$ an off-shell $Z$ boson, is defined by two form factors, namely, $f_4$, characterizing CP-odd effects, and $f_5$, which is CP-even. Constraints from the Large Hadron Collider on both these quantities are currently ${\cal O}(10^{-4})$. Our calculation yields CP-nonpreserving contributions to $ZZZ$, which are absent in the framework of the sole Standard Model. Our estimations show that the $f_4$ contribution might be as large as ${\cal O}(10^{-7})$ for heavy-neutrino masses $\sim1\,{\rm TeV}$. CP-even contributions $f_5$ are also generated, which are, in general, larger than their CP-odd counterparts. We estimate them to be as large as ${\cal O}(10^{-4})$ at a center-of-mass energy of $500\,{\rm GeV}$, in $e^+e^-$ collisions.</p>

<p>2023-09-05, <strong>Multi-messenger signatures of delayed choked jets in tidal disruption events</strong>, Mainak Mukhopadhyay et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02275v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.02275v1</a></p>

<p>Recent radio observations and coincident neutrino detections suggest that some tidal disruption events (TDEs) exhibit late-time activities, relative to the optical emission peak, and these may be due to delayed outflows launched from the central supermassive black hole. We investigate the possibility that jets launched with a time delay of days to months, interact with a debris that may expand outwards. We discuss the effects of the time delay and expansion velocity on the outcomes of jet breakout and collimation. We find that a jet with an isotropic-equivalent luminosity of $\lesssim 5 \times 10^{45}\,{\rm erg/s}$ is likely to be choked for a delay time of $\sim 3$ months. We also study the observational signatures of such delayed choked jets. The jet-debris interaction preceding the breakout would lead to particle acceleration and the resulting synchrotron emission can be detected by current and near-future radio, optical and X-ray telescopes, and the expanding jet-driven debris could explain late-time radio emission. We discuss high-energy neutrino production in delayed choked jets, and the time delay can significantly alleviate the difficulty of the hidden jet scenario in explaining neutrino coincidences.</p>

<p>2023-09-05, <strong>Testing Lorentz invariance violation using cosmogenic neutrinos</strong>, M. A. Reyes et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02103v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.02103v1</a></p>

<p>Secondary messengers such as neutrinos and photons are expected to be produced in interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with extragalactic background photons. Their propagation could be altered by the effects of Lorentz invariance violation. In this work, we have developed an extension of the SimProp code that includes some Lorentz-violating scenarios affecting the propagation of neutrinos. We present the corresponding expected cosmogenic neutrino fluxes for three different astrophysical scenarios for the production of UHECRs. These results can be used to put constraints on the scale of Lorentz violation in the neutrino sector.</p>

The experiment is currently at the stage of the second phase named JSNS$^{2}$-II with two detectors at near and far locations from the neutrino source. One of the key components of the experiment is an acrylic vessel, that is used for the target volume for the detection of the anti-neutrinos. The specifications, design, and measured properties of the acrylic vessel are described.</p>

<p>Line-intensity mapping (LIM) surveys will characterise the cosmological large-scale structure of emissivity in a range of atomic and molecular spectral lines, but existing literature rarely considers whether these surveys can recover excitation properties of the tracer gas species, such as the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule. Combining basic empirical and physical assumptions with the off-the-shelf Radex radiative transfer code or a Gaussian process emulator of Radex outputs, we devise a basic dark matter halo model for CO emission by tying bulk CO properties to halo properties, exposing physical variables governing CO excitation as free parameters. The CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) is working towards a multi-band survey programme to observe both CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) at $z\sim7$. We show that this programme, as well as a further ‘Triple Deluxe’ extension to higher frequencies covering CO(3-2), is fundamentally capable of successfully recovering the connection between halo mass and CO abundances, and constraining the molecular gas kinetic temperature and density within the star-forming interstellar medium in ways that single-transition CO LIM cannot. Given a fiducial thermal pressure of $\sim10^4$ K cm$^{-3}$ for molecular gas in halos of $\sim10^{10}\,M_\odot$, simulated multi-band COMAP surveys successfully recover the thermal pressure within 68% interval half-widths of 0.5–0.6 dex. Construction of multi-frequency LIM instrumentation to access multiple CO transitions is crucial in harnessing this capability, as part of a cosmic statistical probe of gas metallicity, dust chemistry, and other physical parameters in star-forming regions of the first galaxies and proto-galaxies out of reionisation.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>A Bayesian estimation of the Milky Way’s circular velocity curve using Gaia DR3</strong>, Sven Põder et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02895v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.02895v1</a></p>

<p>Our goal is to calculate the circular velocity curve of the Milky Way, along with corresponding uncertainties that quantify various sources of systematic uncertainty in a self-consistent manner. The observed rotational velocities are described as circular velocities minus the asymmetric drift. The latter is described by the radial axisymmetric Jeans equation. We thus reconstruct the circular velocity curve between Galactocentric distances from 5 kpc to 14 kpc using a Bayesian inference approach. The estimated error bars quantify uncertainties in the Sun’s Galactocentric distance and the spatial-kinematic morphology of the tracer stars. As tracers, we used a sample of roughly 0.6 million stars on the red giant branch stars with six-dimensional phase-space coordinates from Gaia data release 3 (DR3). More than 99% of the sample is confined to a quarter of the stellar disc with mean radial, rotational, and vertical velocity dispersions of $(35\pm 18)\,\rm km/s$, $(25\pm 13)\,\rm km/s$, and $(19\pm 9)\,\rm km/s$, respectively. We find a circular velocity curve with a slope of $0.4\pm 0.6\,\rm km/s/kpc$, which is consistent with a flat curve within the uncertainties. We further estimate a circular velocity at the Sun’s position of $v_c(R_0)=233\pm7\, \rm km/s$ and that a region in the Sun’s vicinity, characterised by a physical length scale of $\sim 1\,\rm kpc$, moves with a bulk motion of $V_{LSR} =7\pm 7\,\rm km/s$. Finally, we estimate that the dark matter (DM) mass within 14 kpc is $\log_{10}M_{\rm DM}(R&lt;14\, {\rm kpc})/{\rm M_{\odot}}= \left(11.2^{+2.0}_{-2.3}\right)$ and the local spherically averaged DM density is $\rho_{\rm DM}(R_0)=\left(0.41^{+0.10}_{-0.09}\right)\,{\rm GeV/cm^3}=\left(0.011^{+0.003}_{-0.002}\right)\,{\rm M_\odot/pc^3}$. In addition, the effect of biased distance estimates on our results is assessed.</p>

<p>Dark matter particles captured in neutron stars deposit their energy as heat. This DM heating effect can be observed only if it dominates over other internal heating effects in NSs. In this work, as an example of such an internal heating source, we consider the frictional heating caused by the creep motion of neutron superfluid vortex lines in the NS crust. The luminosity of this heating effect is controlled by the strength of the interaction between the vortex lines and nuclei in the crust, which can be estimated from the many-body calculation of a high-density nuclear system as well as through the temperature observation of old NSs. We show that both the temperature observation and theoretical calculation suggest that the vortex creep heating dominates over the DM heating. The vortex-nuclei interaction must be smaller than the estimated values by several orders of magnitude to overturn this.</p>

<p>2023-09-05, <strong>Complex AGN feedback in the Teacup galaxy. A powerful ionised galactic outflow, jet-ISM interaction, and evidence for AGN-triggered star formation in a giant bubble</strong>, G. Venturi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02498v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.02498v1</a></p>

<p>The $z$~0.1 type-2 QSO J1430+1339 (the ‘Teacup’) is a complex galaxy showing a loop of ionised gas ~10 kpc in diameter, co-spatial radio bubbles, a compact (~1 kpc) jet, and outflow activity. We used VLT/MUSE optical integral field spectroscopic observations to characterise the properties and effects of the galactic ionised outflow from kpc up to tens of kpc scales and compare them with those of the radio jet. We detect a velocity dispersion enhancement (&gt;300 km/s) elongated over several kpc perpendicular to the radio jet, the AGN ionisation lobes, and the fast outflow, similar to what is found in other galaxies hosting compact, low-power jets, indicating that the jet strongly perturbs the host ISM. The mass outflow rate decreases with distance from the nucleus, from around 100 $M_\odot$/yr in the inner 1-2 kpc to &lt;0.1 $M_\odot$/yr at 30 kpc. The ionised mass outflow rate is ~1-8 times higher than the molecular one, in contrast with what is often quoted in AGN. The driver of the multi-phase outflow is likely a combination of AGN radiation and the jet. The outflow mass-loading factor (~5-10) and the molecular gas depletion time (&lt;10$^8$ yr) indicate that the outflow can significantly affect the star formation and the gas reservoir in the galaxy. However, the fraction of the ionised outflow that is able to escape the dark matter halo potential is likely negligible. We detect blue-coloured continuum emission co-spatial with the ionised gas loop. Here, stellar populations are younger (&lt;100-150 Myr) than in the rest of the galaxy (~0.5-1 Gyr). This constitutes possible evidence for star formation triggered at the edge of the bubble due to the compressing action of the jet and outflow (‘positive feedback’), as predicted by theory. All in all, the Teacup constitutes a rich system in which AGN feedback from outflows and jets, in both its negative and positive flavours, co-exist.</p>

<p>We study the effect of dark matter annihilation on the formation of Jovian planets. We show that dark matter heat injections can slow or halt Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, preventing the accretion of hydrogen and helium onto the solid core. The existence of Jupiter in our solar system can therefore be used to infer constraints on dark matter with relatively strong interaction cross sections. In the case of spin-dependent dark matter, we derive novel constraints beyond the reach of current direct detection experiments. We highlight the possibility of a positive detection using future observations by JWST, which could reveal strongly varying planet morpholoiges close to our Galactic Center.</p>

<p>Timescales in astronomy comprise the largest range of any scientific discipline. In the construction of physical models, this circumstance may both be a blessing and a curse. For example, galaxy evolution occurs on typical timescales of hundreds of millions of years, but is affected by atomic processes on sub-second timescales, posing a challenge in analytical and, in particular, in numerical models. On the other hand, the vast dynamic range implies that we can often make meaningful predictions by simply comparing characteristic timescales of the physical processes involved. This review, aimed primarily at non-astronomer scientists, attempts to highlight some occasions in the context of galaxy formation and evolution in which comparing timescales can shed light on astrophysical phenomena, as well as some of the challenges that may be encountered. In particular we will explore the differences and similarities between theoretical predictions of dark matter halos, and the observed distribution of galaxies. The review concludes with an account of the most recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope, and how they purportedly seem to defy the timescales of the currently accepted concordance model of the structure and evolution of the Universe, the {\Lambda}CDM model.</p>

<p>The Kalb-Ramond field is an antisymmetric, rank-two tensor field which most notably appears in the context of string theory, but has largely been unexplored in the context of cosmology. In this work, motivated by the Kalb-Ramond field in string theory, and antisymmetric tensor fields that emerge in effective field theories ranging from particle physics to condensed matter, we study the primordial production of interacting massive Kalb-Ramond-like-particles (KRLPs). KRLPs contain features of both dark photon and axion models, which can be appreciated via their duality properties. While the massless non-interacting KRLP is dual to a pseudoscalar, and the massive non-interacting KRLP is dual to a pseudovector, the interacting massive KRLP can be distinguished from its scalar and vector counterparts. We study early-universe production of KRLPs via the freeze-in mechanism, considering a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dark photon-like' interaction, an </code>axion-like’ interaction, and a `Higgs portal’ interaction, as well as production via cosmological gravitational particle production. We find that as a dark matter candidate, KRLPs can be produced by all of the above mechanisms and account for the relic density of dark matter today for a wide range of masses. Finally, we comment on the potential to obtain both warm and cold dark matter subcomponents, and speculate on observational and experimental prospects.</p>

<p>Dark matter (DM) can consist of a scalar field so light that DM particles in the galactic halo are best described by classical waves. We investigate how these classical solutions are influenced by the presence of a non-rotating supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, using an analytical, albeit approximate, approach.   Relying on this analytic control, we examine the consequences of imposing causal boundary conditions at the horizon, which are typically overlooked. First, we examine the scenario where the backreaction of dark matter can be neglected. The scalar field decays like a power law at large distances, thus endowing the black hole with “hair”. We derive solutions for the field profile over a wide range of parameters, including cases with rotating dark matter. As a by-product, we extract the dynamical Love numbers for scalar perturbations. Next, we determine the spectrum of bound states and their behaviour.   Finally, we incorporate the self-gravity of the scalar field, with a focus on the situation where dark matter forms a soliton (boson star) at the center of the galaxy. We derive an analytical expression for the soliton at every distance from the center. With a solution that remains applicable even at horizon scales, we can reliably compute the accretion rate of the black hole.</p>

<p>In this work, we investigate the discovery potential of low-mass Galactic dark matter (DM) subhaloes for indirect searches of DM. We use data from the Via Lactea II (VL-II) N-body cosmological simulation, which resolves subhaloes down to $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ solar masses and it is thus ideal for this purpose. First, we characterize the abundance, distribution and structural properties of the VL-II subhalo population in terms of both subhalo masses and maximum circular velocities. Then, we repopulate the original simulation with millions of subhaloes of masses down to about five orders of magnitude below the minimum VL-II subhalo mass (more than one order of magnitude in velocities). We compute subhalo DM annihilation astrophysical “J-factors” and angular sizes for the entire subhalo population, by placing the Earth at a random position but at the right galactocentric distance in the simulation. Thousands of these realizations are generated in order to obtain statistically meaningful results. We find that some nearby low-mass Galactic subhaloes, not massive enough to retain stars or gas, may indeed yield DM annihilation fluxes comparable to those expected from other, more massive and acknowledgeable DM targets like dwarf satellite galaxies. Typical angular sizes are of the order of the degree, thus subhaloes potentially appearing as extended sources in gamma-ray telescopes, depending on instrument angular resolution and sensitivity. Our work shows that low-mass Galactic subhaloes with no visible counterparts are expected to play a relevant role in current and future indirect DM search searches and should indeed be considered as excellent DM targets.</p>

<p>In this paper, we investigate the process in which axion dark matter undergoes thermal friction, resulting in energy injection into dark radiation, with the aim of mitigating the Hubble tension and large-scale structure tension. In the early universe, this scenario led to a rapid increase in the energy density of dark radiation; in the late universe, the evolution of axion dark matter is similar to that of cold dark matter, with this scenario resembling decaying dark matter and serving to ease the large-scale structure tension. We employ cosmological observational data, including cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), supernova data (SNIa), $H_0$ measurement from SH0ES, and $S_8$ from the Dark Energy Survey Year-3 (DES), to study and analyze this model. Our results indicate that the thermal friction model offers partial alleviation of the large-scale structure tension, while its contribution on alleviating Hubble tension can be ignored. The new model constrained by the complete dataset yields the value of $S_8$ is $0.795\pm 0.011$ at 68\% confidence level, while the $\Lambda$CDM model yields a result of $0.8023\pm 0.0085$. In addition, when constrained solely by CMB, BAO, and SNIa data, the $\Lambda$CDM model exhibits a smaller $\chi^2_\mathrm{tot}$ statistical value. However, upon incorporating SH0ES and DES data, the new model exhibits a lower $\chi^2_\mathrm{tot}$ value, with a difference of -2.60 compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</p>

<p>Temperature profiles of the hot galaxy cluster intracluster medium (ICM) have a complex non-linear structure that traditional parametric modelling may fail to fully approximate. For this study, we made use of neural networks, for the first time, to construct a data-driven non-parametric model of ICM temperature profiles. A new deconvolution algorithm was then introduced to uncover the true (3D) temperature profiles from the observed projected (2D) temperature profiles. An auto-encoder-inspired neural network was first trained by learning a non-linear interpolatory scheme to build the underlying model of 3D temperature profiles in the radial range of [0.02-2] R$_{500}$, using a sparse set of hydrodynamical simulations from the THREE HUNDRED PROJECT. A deconvolution algorithm using a learning-based regularisation scheme was then developed. The model was tested using high and low resolution input temperature profiles, such as those expected from simulations and observations, respectively. We find that the proposed deconvolution and deprojection algorithm is robust with respect to the quality of the data, the morphology of the cluster, and the deprojection scheme used. The algorithm can recover unbiased 3D radial temperature profiles with a precision of around 5\% over most of the fitting range. We apply the method to the first sample of temperature profiles obtained with XMM{\it -Newton} for the CHEX-MATE project and compared it to parametric deprojection and deconvolution techniques. Our work sets the stage for future studies that focus on the deconvolution of the thermal profiles (temperature, density, pressure) of the ICM and the dark matter profiles in galaxy clusters, using deep learning techniques in conjunction with X-ray, Sunyaev Zel’Dovich (SZ) and optical datasets.</p>

<p>Single-photon transitions are one of the key technologies for designing and operating very-long-baseline atom interferometers tailored for terrestrial gravitational-wave and dark-matter detection. Since such setups aim at the detection of relativistic and beyond-Standard-Model physics, the analysis of interferometric phases as well as of atomic diffraction must be performed to this precision and including these effects. In contrast, most treatments focused on idealized diffraction so far. Here, we study single-photon transitions, both magnetically-induced and direct ones, in gravity and Standard-Model extensions modeling dark matter as well as Einstein-equivalence-principle violations. We take into account relativistic effects like the coupling of internal to center-of-mass degrees of freedom, induced by the mass defect, as well as the gravitational redshift of the diffracting light pulse. To this end, we also include chirping of the light pulse required by terrestrial setups, as well as its associated modified momentum transfer for single-photon transitions.</p>

<p>We test the consistency of dark matter velocity distributions obtained from dark matter-only numerical simulations with analytic predictions, using the publicly available Via Lactea 2 dataset as an example. We find that, well inside the scale radius, the velocity distribution obtained from numerical simulation is consistent with a function of a single integral of motion – the energy – and moreover is consistent with the result obtained from Eddington inversion. This indicates that the assumptions underlying the analytic result, namely, spherical symmetry, isotropy, and a static potential, are sufficiently accurate to govern the coarse properties of the velocity distribution in the inner regions of the halo. We discuss implications for the behavior of the high-velocity tail of the distribution, which can dominate dark matter annihilation from a $p$- or $d$-wave state.</p>

<p>The lightest $Z_2$ odd particle in the scotogenic model, referred to as scotogenic dark matter (DM), is a widely studied candidate for DM. This scotogenic DM is generated through well-known thermal processes as well as via the evaporation of primordial black holes (PBHs). Recent reports suggested that the curvature fluctuations of PBHs during an epoch dominated by these entities in the early universe can serve as the source of so-called induced gravitational waves (GWs). In this study, we demonstrate that stringent constraints on the mass of scotogenic DM and PBHs can be obtained through the detection of induced GWs using future detectors.</p>

<p>The generation and evolution of dust in galaxies are important tracers for star formation, and can characterize the rest-frame ultraviolet to infrared emission from the galaxies. In particular understanding dust in high-redshift galaxies are important for observational cosmology, as they would be necessary to extract information on star formation in the early universe. We update the public semi-analytical model A-SLOTH (Ancient Stars and Local Observables by Tracing Halos) to model the evolution of dust, focusing on high-redshift star-forming galaxies with stellar masses of $\sim 10^8$–$10^{10}M_\odot$ observed by ALMA ($z\approx 7$) and JWST ($z\approx 11$). We find that these galaxies should qualitatively differ in their star formation properties; while the samples in ALMA are explained by dust growth in normal star-forming galaxies, the lack of dust in the samples by JWST requires dust ejection by radiation pressure due to recent highly efficient star-formation within a few 10 Myr, with order 100 times higher efficiency than normal galaxies calibrated by A-SLOTH. Depending on where the JWST galaxies locate on the luminosity function, their bursty star formation histories inferred from our model can have impacts for rates of star formation, supernova explosion, stellar feedback, and detectability of dusty, mature galaxies in the very early universe.</p>

<p>We present a phenomenological model to investigate the chiral phase transition characterized by parity doubling in dense, beta equilibrated, cold matter. Our model incorporates effective interactions constrained by SU(3) relations and considers baryonic degrees of freedom. By constraining the model with astrophysical data and nuclear matter properties, we find a first-order phase transition within realistic values of the slope parameter L. The inclusion of the baryon octet and negative parity partners, along with a chiral-invariant mass $m_{0}$, allows for a non-massless chiral symmetric phase. Through exploration of parameter space, we identify parameter sets satisfying mass and radius constraints without requiring a partonic phase. The appearance of the parity partner of the nucleon, the N(1535) resonance, suppresses strangeness, pushing hyperonization to higher densities. We observe a mild first-order phase transition to the chirally restored phase, governed by $m_{0}$. Our calculations of surface tension highlight its strong dependence on $m_{0}$. The existence of mixed phases is ruled out since they become energetically too costly. We compare stars with metastable and stable cores using both branches of the equation of state. Despite limited lifespans due to low surface tension values, phase conversion and star contraction could impact neutron stars with masses around 1.3 solar masses or more. We discuss some applications of this model in its non-zero temperatures generalization and scenarios beyond beta equilibrium that can provide insights into core-collapse supernovae, proto-neutron star evolution, and neutron star mergers. Core-collapse supernovae dynamics, influenced by chiral symmetry restoration and exotic hadronic states, affect explosion mechanisms and nucleosynthesis.</p>

<p>Based on the expected population of core collapse supernova remnants and the huge number of detected pulsars in the Galaxy, still representing only a fraction of the real population, pulsar wind nebulae are likely to constitute one of the largest classes of {extended} Galactic sources in many energy bands. For simple evolutionary reasons, the majority of the population is made of evolved systems, whose detection and identification are complicated by their reduced luminosity, the possible lack of X-ray emission (that fades progressively away with the age of the pulsar), and by their modified morphology with respect to young systems. Nevertheless they have gained renewed attention in recent years, following the detection of misaligned X-ray tails protruding from an increasing number of nebulae created by fast moving pulsars, and of extended TeV halos surrounding aged systems. Both these features are clear signs of an efficient escape of particles, with energy close to the maximum acceleration limit of the pulsar. Here we discuss the properties of those evolved systems and what we have understood about the process of particle escape, and the formation of observed features.</p>

<p>Jets of active galactic nuclei are potential accelerators of ultra high-energy cosmic rays. Supernovae can occur inside these jets and contribute to cosmic ray acceleration, particularly of heavy nuclei, but that contribution has been hardly investigated so far. We carried out a first dedicated exploration of the role of supernovae inside extragalactic jets in the production of ultra high-energy cosmic rays. We characterized the energy budget of supernova-jet interactions, and the maximum possible energies of the particles accelerated in those events, likely dominated by heavy nuclei. This allowed us to assess whether these interactions can be potential acceleration sites of ultra high-energy cosmic rays, or at least of their seeds. For that, we estimated the cosmic ray luminosity for different galaxy types, and compared the injection rate of cosmic ray seeds into the jet with that due to galactic cosmic ray entrainment. Since the supernova is fueled for a long time by the luminosity of the jet, the energy of a supernova-jet interaction can be several orders of magnitude greater than that of an isolated supernova. Thus, despite the low rate of supernovae expected to occur in the jet, they could still provide more seeds for accelerating ultra high-energy particles than cosmic ray entrainment from the host galaxy. Moreover, these interactions can create sufficiently efficient accelerators to be a source of cosmic rays with energies $\gtrsim 10$~EeV. Supernova-jet interactions can contribute significantly to the production of ultra high-energy cosmic rays, either directly by accelerating these particles themselves or indirectly by providing pre-accelerated seeds.</p>

In addition, when constrained solely by CMB, BAO, and SNIa data, the $\Lambda$CDM model exhibits a smaller $\chi^2_\mathrm{tot}$ statistical value. However, upon incorporating SH0ES and DES data, the new model exhibits a lower $\chi^2_\mathrm{tot}$ value, with a difference of -2.60 compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</p>

<p>We perform a new general-relativistic viscous-radiation hydrodynamics simulation for supernova-like explosion associated with stellar core collapse of rotating massive stars to a system of a black hole and a massive torus paying particular attention to large-mass progenitor stars with the zero-age main-sequence mass of $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=$20, 35, and 45$M_\odot$ of Ref.~\cite{Aguilera-Dena2020oct}. Assuming that a black hole is formed in a short timescale after the onset of the stellar collapse, the new simulations are started from initial data of a spinning black hole and infalling matter that self-consistently satisfy the constraint equations of general relativity. It is found that with a reasonable size of the viscous parameter, the supernova-like explosion is driven by the viscous heating effect in the torus around the black hole irrespective of the progenitor mass. The typical explosion energy and ejecta mass for the large-mass cases ($M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=35$ and $45M_\odot$) are $\sim 10^{52}$ erg and $\sim 5M_\odot$, respectively, with $^{56}$Ni mass larger than $0.15M_\odot$. These are consistent with the observational data of stripped-envelope and high-energy supernovae such as broad-lined type Ic supernovae. This indicates that rotating stellar collapses of massive stars to a black hole surrounded by a massive torus can be a central engine for high-energy supernovae. By artificially varying the angular velocity of the initial data, we explore the dependence of the explosion energy and ejecta mass on the initial angular momentum and find that the large explosion energy $\sim 10^{52}$ erg and large $^{56}$Ni mass $\geq 0.15M_\odot$ are possible only when a large-mass compact torus with mass $\gtrsim 1M_\odot$ is formed.</p>

<p>2023-09-05, <strong>Matched filtering for gravitational wave detection without template bank driven by deep learning template prediction model bank</strong>, CunLiang Ma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02030v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.02030v1</a></p>

<p>The existing matched filtering method for gravitational wave (GW) search relies on a template bank. The computational efficiency of this method scales with the size of the templates within the bank. Higher-order modes and eccentricity will play an important role when third-generation detectors operate in the future. In this case, traditional GW search methods will hit computational limits. To speed up the computational efficiency of GW search, we propose the utilization of a deep learning (DL) model bank as a substitute for the template bank. This model bank predicts the latent templates embedded in the strain data. Combining an envelope extraction network and an astrophysical origin discrimination network, we realize a novel GW search framework. The framework can predict the GW signal’s matched filtering signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Unlike the end-to-end DL-based GW search method, our statistical SNR holds greater physical interpretability than the $p_{score}$ metric. Moreover, the intermediate results generated by our approach, including the predicted template, offer valuable assistance in subsequent GW data processing tasks such as parameter estimation and source localization. Compared to the traditional matched filtering method, the proposed method can realize real-time analysis. The minor improvements in the future, the proposed method may expand to other scopes of GW search, such as GW emitted by the supernova explosion.</p>

<p>2023-09-05, <strong>Circumstellar Material Ejected Violently by A Massive Star Immediately before its Death</strong>, Jujia Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01998v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.01998v1</a></p>

<p>Type II supernovae represent the most common stellar explosions in the Universe, for which the final stage evolution of their hydrogen-rich massive progenitors towards core-collapse explosion are elusive. The recent explosion of SN 2023ixf in a very nearby galaxy, Messier 101, provides a rare opportunity to explore this longstanding issue. With the timely high-cadence flash spectra taken within 1-5 days after the explosion, we can put stringent constraints on the properties of the surrounding circumstellar material around this supernova. Based on the rapid fading of the narrow emission lines and luminosity/profile of $\rm H\alpha$ emission at very early times, we estimate that the progenitor of SN 2023ixf lost material at a mass-loss rate $\dot{\rm M} \approx 6 \times 10^{-4}\, \rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ over the last 2-3 years before explosion. This close-by material, moving at a velocity $v_{\rm w} \approx 55\rm \, km\,s^{-1}$, accumulates a compact CSM shell at the radius smaller than $7 \times 10^{14}$ cm from the progenitor. Given the high mass-loss rate and relatively large wind velocity presented here, together with the pre-explosion observations made about two decades ago, the progenitor of SN 2023ixf could be a short-lived yellow hypergiant that evolved from a red supergiant shortly before the explosion.</p>

<p>2023-09-05, <strong>Magnetic structures and turbulence in SN 1006 revealed with imaging X-ray polarimetry</strong>, Ping Zhou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01879v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.01879v1</a></p>

<p>Young supernova remnants (SNRs) strongly modify surrounding magnetic fields, which in turn play an essential role in accelerating cosmic rays (CRs). X-ray polarization measurements probe magnetic field morphology and turbulence at the immediate acceleration site. We report the X-ray polarization distribution in the northeastern shell of SN1006 from a 1 Ms observation with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). We found an average polarization degree of $22.4\pm 3.5\%$ and an average polarization angle of $-45.4\pm 4.5^\circ$ (measured on the plane of the sky from north to east). The X-ray polarization angle distribution reveals that the magnetic fields immediately behind the shock in the northeastern shell of SN 1006 are nearly parallel to the shock normal or radially distributed, similar to that in the radio observations, and consistent with the quasi-parallel CR acceleration scenario. The X-ray emission is marginally more polarized than that in the radio band. The X-ray polarization degree of SN 1006 is much larger than that in Cas A and Tycho, together with the relatively tenuous and smooth ambient medium of the remnant, favoring that CR-induced instabilities set the turbulence in SN 1006 and CR acceleration is environment-dependent.</p>
