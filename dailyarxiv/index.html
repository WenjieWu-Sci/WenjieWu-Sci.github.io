<p>2025-05-19, <strong>Probing the 3+1 neutrino model in the SHiP experiment</strong>, Ki-Young Choi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12785v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.12785v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, as an extension of our previous work, we estimate the sensitivity of the Search for Hidden Particles (SHiP) experiment to the 3+1 model using the charged-current deep inelastic scattering event spectrum. We employ the Feldman-Cousins method with a parametric bootstrap to account for nuisance parameters and systematic uncertainties. In the previous study, we proposed a dual baseline approach by suggesting Far SND (FSND) at 120 m with Near SND (NSND) at 27 m. We employ the same approach in this study. The NSND-only configuration can probe mixing parameters of $|U_{\alpha4}|^2 \gtrsim 0.1$ near $\Delta m_{41}^2 \sim 10^3\,\mathrm{eV}^2$, with a reduction of normalized systematic uncertainties from 20\% to 10\% improving sensitivity by roughly a factor of two. Moreover, the inclusion of FSND significantly enhances the sensitivity by a factor of 2 to 10 depending on the flavor and the systematic uncertainty. In two-flavor mixing scenarios, a cancellation between neutrino appearance and disappearance generates kinks in the sensitivity curves, that are vanished in the dual-baseline approach.</p>

<p>2025-05-19, <strong>Cluster optical depth and pairwise velocity estimation using machine learning</strong>, Yulin Gong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12720v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.12720v1</a></p>

<p>We apply two machine learning methods, a CNN deep-leaning model and a gradient-boosting decision tree, to estimate individual cluster optical depths from observed properties derived from multiple complementary datasets. The models are trained and tested with simulated N-body derived halo catalogs and synthetic full-sky CMB maps designed to mirror data from the DESI and Simons Observatory experiments. Specifically, the thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (tSZ) and CMB lensing convergence, along with cluster virial mass estimates are used as features to train the machine learning models. The predicted optical depths are combined with kinematic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (kSZ) measurements to estimate individual cluster radial peculiar velocities. The method is shown to recover an unbiased estimate of the pairwise velocity statistics of the simulated cluster sample. The model’s efficacy is demonstrated for halos with mass range $10^{13} M_{\odot} &lt; M_{200} &lt; 10^{15} M_{\odot}$ over a redshift range $0&lt;z&lt;1$, and validated in the presence of primary CMB, instrument noise, lensing convergence noise, and potential uncertainties in halo virial mass estimates. We apply the method to ACT CMB data, using ACT DR4 component-separated maps for tSZ and CMB lensing and ACT DR5 maps for kSZ, in conjunction with galaxy clusters observed in the SDSS DR15 spectroscopic survey. We demonstrate that the machine learning approach is an effective one to analyze data from current and upcoming CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory and CCAT, and galaxy surveys, such as DESI and Roman, for which the pairwise velocity statistics can provide valuable insights into the properties of neutrinos and gravity on cosmic scales.</p>

<p>2025-05-18, <strong>The role of non-metricity on neutrino behavior in bumblebee gravity</strong>, Yuxuan Shi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12551v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.12551v1</a></p>

<p>Within the context of bumblebee gravity, this work explores how non-metricity alters the behavior and propagation of neutrinos. Our analysis is based on the black hole configuration introduced in Ref. [1], focusing on how the spacetime deformation affects some neutrino-related processes. Three primary aspects are fundamentally taken into account: the modification in the energy deposition rate stemming from neutrino-antineutrino annihilation, the alterations in the oscillation phase caused by the background geometry, and the role of lensing effects on the transition probabilities among neutrino flavors. Complementing the analytical approach, numerical evaluations of oscillation probabilities are performed within a two-flavor scenario, accounting for both inverted and normal mass ordering configurations.</p>

<p>2025-05-19, <strong>HydroX, a light dark matter search with hydrogen-doped liquid xenon time projection chambers</strong>, W. H. Lippincott et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13402v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.13402v1</a></p>

<p>Experimental efforts searching for dark matter particles over the last few decades have ruled out many candidates led by the new generation of tonne-scale liquid xenon. For light dark matter, hydrogen could be a better target than xenon as it would offer a better kinematic match to the low mass particles. This article describes the HydroX concept, an idea to expand the dark matter sensitivity reach of large liquid xenon detectors by adding hydrogen to the liquid xenon. We discuss the nature of signal generation in liquid xenon to argue that the signal produced at the interaction site by a dark matter-hydrogen interaction could be significantly enhanced over the same interaction on xenon, increasing the sensitivity to the lightest particles. We discuss the technical implications of adding hydrogen to a xenon detector, as well as some background considerations. Finally, we make projections as to the potential sensitivity of a HydroX implementation and discuss next steps.</p>

<p>2025-05-19, <strong>Constraining Reheating Temperature, Inflaton-SM Coupling and Dark Matter Mass in Light of ACT DR6 Observations</strong>, Rajesh Mondal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13387v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.13387v1</a></p>

<p>We explore the phenomenological implications of the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 observations, in combination with Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, and DESI, on the physics of inflation and post-inflationary reheating. We focus on the $\alpha$-attractor class of inflationary models (both E- and T-models) and consider two reheating scenarios: perturbative inflaton ($\phi$) decay ($\phi \rightarrow bb$) and inflaton annihilation ($\phi \phi \rightarrow bb$) into Standard Model (SM) bosonic particles ($b$). By solving the Boltzmann equations, we derive bounds on key reheating parameters, including the reheating temperature, the inflaton equation of state (EoS), and the inflaton-SM coupling, in light of ACT data. To accurately constrain the coupling, we incorporate the Bose enhancement effect in the decay width. To ensure the validity of our perturbative approach, we also identify the regime where nonperturbative effects, such as parametric resonance, become significant. Additionally, we include indirect constraints from primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), which can impact the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. These constraints further bound the reheating temperature, particularly in scenarios with a stiff EoS. Finally, we analyze dark matter (DM) production through purely gravitational interactions during reheating and determine the allowed mass ranges consistent with the constrained reheating parameter space and recent ACT data. Our results highlight the constraining power of next-generation CMB datasets on inflationary dynamics, reheating, and the DM parameter space.</p>

<p>2025-05-19, <strong>Fermionic sub-GeV Dark Matter from evaporating Primordial Black Holes at DarkSide-50</strong>, The DarkSide-50 Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13093v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.13093v1</a></p>

<p>We present a search for boosted dark matter from Primordial Black Holes (PBH) evaporation using the DarkSide-50 ionization-signal-only dataset corresponding to the experiment’s ($12202\pm180$) ${\rm kg: d}$ exposure. We focus on evaporation of PBHs with masses in the range [$10^{14},\,10^{16}$] g producing Dirac fermionic dark matter particles with sub-GeV kinetic energy. These relativistic particles, with energies up to hundreds of MeV, can generate detectable signals for masses below $\mathcal{O}(100)$ MeV. The absence of a signal enables setting complementary limits to those derived from cosmological observations and direct detection searches for cosmic ray-boosted dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-05-19, <strong>Experimental Particle Physics Priorities 2025: A String Phenomenology Perspective</strong>, Jonathan DeMont et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12965v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.12965v1</a></p>

<p>With the SNOWMASS 2021 process in the US and the on–going European Strategy Report 2025, the field of elementary particle physics is undergoing detailed community evaluation, and the experimental particle physics program, which requires substantial public investment, is under scrutiny. We offer an assessment of the current experimental particle physics priorities from a string phenomenology point of view. String theory provides a perturbatively consistent framework for quantum gravity. String phenomenology aims to connect between string theory and observational data. String theory is a consistent theory of quantum gravity that contains the other fundamental constituents of matter and interactions. As all forms of energy couple to gravity, string theory provides a framework that reproduces the structures of the Standard Model of particle physics and gives rise to detailed physics scenarios beyond the Standard Model, {\it e.g.} dark matter candidates, axions, additional gauge symmetries, etc. Given this breadth, we propose that from a string phenomenology perspective, the experimental particle physics priority is the nature of the Higgs boson and the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. An ideal facility in the near future to study this sector is a hadron collider at 50–60 TeV that utilises contemporary magnet technology and can be built in 10–15 years from decision.</p>

<p>2025-05-19, <strong>Lecture Notes: WISPs in gamma-ray astrophysics</strong>, Francesca Calore et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12905v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.12905v1</a></p>

<p>These lecture notes provide an overview of high-energy astrophysical processes involving axions, axion-like particles (ALPs), and other weakly interacting slim particles (WISPs) focusing on their potential observational signatures in astrophysical environments. After introducing key concepts in high-energy astrophysics, we present the fundamental properties of WISPs, emphasizing their phenomenological implications. Particular attention is given to ALP-photon conversion in strong magnetic fields and the possible decay signatures of ALPs in sources such as active galactic nuclei, galaxy clusters, and cosmic-ray accelerators. These effects can lead to distinctive modifications in astrophysical spectra, spatial distributions, and polarization patterns, providing unique probes of physics beyond the Standard Model. We discuss their role in dark matter scenarios and their potential impact on high-energy observations. The lecture series is supplemented by hands-on tutorials, including exercises on axion electrodynamics and an analysis of gamma-ray data from NGC 1275 to search for ALP-photon conversion signatures.</p>

<p>2025-05-18, <strong>Comprehensive Constraints on ALP Couplings from future $e^+e^-$ Colliders, Muon $g-2$, Thermal Dark Matter and Higgs Measurements</strong>, Pramod Sharma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12466v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.12466v1</a></p>

<p>In this article, we present projected 95% C.L. limits on Axion-Like Particle (ALP) couplings from ALP production at a future $e^+e^-$ collider operating at $\sqrt{s} = 250~\text{GeV}$ with integrated luminosity $L = 0.5~\text{ab}^{-1}$. We constrain the effective couplings $g_{\gamma\gamma}$, $g_{Z\gamma}$, $g_{ZZ}$, and $g_{WW}$ over the ALP mass range $20~\text{GeV} \leq m_a \leq 100~\text{GeV}$, finding projected bounds at the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})~\text{TeV}^{-1}$ for $g_{\gamma\gamma}/f_a$. We then focus on the $4\sigma$-favored region of the muon anomalous magnetic moment $\Delta a_\mu$, deriving corresponding bounds on $g_{\gamma\gamma}$ and the ALP-muon coupling $C_{\mu\mu}$, and applying them to a fermionic dark matter scenario in which the relic density depends on both $m_\chi$ and $m_a$. The same parameter space is further constrained by Higgs signal strength measurements through $h \to \gamma\gamma$ and $h \to Z\gamma$. A comparative analysis with existing experimental and theoretical bounds highlights the complementarity of $\Delta a_\mu$, dark matter, and Higgs signal strengths observables in constraining ALP couplings.</p>

<p>2025-05-19, <strong>Type Ia supernova growth-rate measurement with LSST simulations: intrinsic scatter systematics</strong>, Bastien Carreres et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13290v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.13290v1</a></p>

<p>Measurement of the growth rate of structures ($\fsig$) with Type Ia supernovae (\sns) will improve our understanding of the nature of dark energy and enable tests of general relativity. In this paper, we generate simulations of the 10 year \sn\ dataset of the Rubin-LSST survey, including a correlated velocity field from a N-body simulation and realistic models of \sns\ properties and their correlations with host-galaxy properties. We find, similar to SN~Ia analyses that constrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameters $w_0w_a$, that constraints on $\fsig$ can be biased depending on the intrinsic scatter of \sns. While for the majority of intrinsic scatter models we recover $\fsig$ with a precision of $\sim13 - 14\%$, for the most realistic dust-based model, we find that the presence of non-Gaussianities in Hubble diagram residuals leads to a bias on $\fsig$ of about $\sim-20\%$. When trying to correct for the dust-based intrinsic scatter, we find that the propagation of the uncertainty on the model parameters does not significantly increase the error on $\fsig$. We also find that while the main component of the error budget of $\fsig$ is the statistical uncertainty ($&gt;75\%$ of the total error budget), the systematic error budget is dominated by the uncertainty on the damping parameter, $\sigma_u$, that gives an empirical description of the effect of redshift space distortions on the velocity power spectrum. Our results motivate a search for new methods to correct for the non-Gaussian distribution of the Hubble diagram residuals, as well as an improved modeling of the damping parameter.</p>

<p>2025-05-19, <strong>High-Velocity Molecular Clouds in M83</strong>, Maki Nagata et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12757v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.12757v1</a></p>

<p>High-velocity clouds (HVCs), which are gas clouds moving at high velocity relative to the galactic disk, may play a critical role in galaxy evolution, potentially supplying gas to the disk and triggering star formation. In this study, we focus on the nearby face-on barred spiral galaxy M83, where high spatial resolution, high-sensitivity CO (1-0) data are available. We identified molecular clouds and searched for clouds with velocities deviating by more than 50km/s from the disk velocity field as HVCs. A total of 10 HVCs were detected -nine redshifted and one blueshifted – clearly highlighting an asymmetry in their velocity distribution. These HVCs have radii of 30-80 pc, masses on the order of $10^5 M_\odot$, and velocity dispersions of 3-20 km/s, displaying a tendency toward higher velocity dispersion compared to disk molecular clouds in M83. Most of the HVCs do not overlap with the candidates of supernova remnants, and the energy needed to drive HVCs at such high velocities exceeds single supernova energy. Together with the asymmetry in their velocity distribution, we thus conclude that most of the HVCs found in this study are inflow from outside the M83’s disk.</p>
