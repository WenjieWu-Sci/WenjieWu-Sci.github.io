<p>2026-02-05, <strong>Poisson Log-Normal Process for Count Data Prediction</strong>, Anushka Saha et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05926v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.05926v1</a></p>

<p>Modeling count data is important in physics and other scientific disciplines, where measurements often involve discrete, non-negative quantities such as photon or neutrino detection events. Traditional parametric approaches can be trained to generate integer-count predictions but may struggle with capturing complex, non-linear dependencies often observed in the data. Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a robust non-parametric alternative to modeling continuous data; however, it cannot generate integer outputs. We propose the Poisson Log-Normal (PoLoN) process, a framework that employs GP to model Poisson log-rates. As in GP regression, our approach relies on the correlations between data points captured via GP kernel structure rather than explicit functional parameterizations. We demonstrate that the PoLoN predictive distribution is Poisson-LogNormal and provide an algorithm for optimizing kernel hyperparameters. Furthermore, we adapt the PoLoN approach to the problem of detecting weak localized signals superimposed on a smoothly varying background - a task of considerable interest in many areas of science and engineering. Our framework allows us to predict the strength, location and width of the detected signals. We evaluate PoLoN’s performance using both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the open dataset from CERN which was used to detect the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider. Our results indicate that the PoLoN process can be used as a non-parametric alternative for analyzing, predicting, and extracting signals from integer-valued data.</p>

<p>2026-02-05, <strong>Early-universe constraints on the electron mass</strong>, Michela Garramone et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05720v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.05720v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the impact of a nonstandard electron mass $m_e$ on early-Universe thermal history, focusing on neutrino decoupling and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). In the standard cosmology, neutrino–electron interactions keep neutrinos in thermal contact with the electromagnetic plasma until shortly before $e^\pm$ annihilation. Varying $m_e$ shifts the decoupling epoch and the entropy transfer from $e^\pm$ annihilation, thereby modifying the neutrino energy density and the inferred effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$. Independently, during BBN the rates of charged-current weak processes, and hence the neutron-to-proton ratio, depend on $m_e$. By confronting BBN predictions for the primordial light-element abundances with observations and imposing cosmological constraints on $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, we obtain a bound on $m_e$ in the early Universe of $m_e = 0.504^{+0.007}_{-0.006}$ MeV or $m_e=0.510\pm0.007$ MeV ($1σ$), depending on the considered nuclear reaction network (NACRE II or PRIMAT, respectively). The allowed range is close to the present laboratory value at the level of 1.4\%, thus supporting the constancy of the electron mass over cosmological timescales.</p>

<p>2026-02-05, <strong>Exploring the central engines of gamma-ray bursts from prompt light curves</strong>, Xue Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05587v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.05587v1</a></p>

<p>Hyperaccreting stellar-mass black hole systems are leading candidates for the central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Their jets are thought to be powered by either the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process or neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs), but discriminating between these mechanisms remains challenging. To address this, we propose using the luminosity decay slope (parameter d) of GRB light curves to distinguish between the BZ and NDAF mechanisms, thereby linking the light-curve morphology to the central engine physics. By analysing 85 single-peaked GRBs with fast-rise, exponential-decay (FRED) profiles observed by Swift/BAT using 64 ms background-subtracted light curves, we fit the decay slope (parameter d) with the empirical Kocevski-Ryde-Liang (KRL) function and compare the results with theoretical predictions for the BZ (d approximately 1.67) and the NDAF (d approximately 3.7 to 7.8) mechanisms. We find that the decay slope (parameter d) can differentiate central engine mechanisms, with 15 GRBs consistent with the BZ mechanism and 22 supporting the NDAF mechanism. However, most events exhibit slopes within the range between 2 and 4, suggesting a hybrid of mechanisms, with NDAF being dominant.</p>

<p>2026-02-05, <strong>Neutrino mass ordering in JUNO at risk from scalar NSI induced resonance</strong>, Sandhya Choubey et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05564v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.05564v1</a></p>

<p>The determination of neutrino mass ordering (NMO) is the primary goal of the currently running JUNO reactor experiment. We show that the measurement of NMO at JUNO may severely deteriorate in the presence of non-standard neutrino interactions mediated by a beyond standard model scalar (SNSI). Taking inverted ordering and the lightest neutrino mass at $m_l=0.01$ eV, the NMO sensitivity falls below $2σ$ for SNSI parameter values in the range $η_{ee}&lt; -7.1\times 10^{-3}$ and $η_{ee} &gt; 3.3\times 10^{-3}$. More importantly, for $η_{ee} \gtrsim 5.7\times 10^{-3}$ the NMO sensitivity in JUNO is completely lost. We show that this is due to the presence of a hitherto unrecognized resonant enhancement of the mixing angle $θ_{12}$, which gives rise to a mass ordering degeneracy.</p>

<p>2026-02-05, <strong>Quantum Fisher Information Revealing Parameter Sensitivity in Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiments</strong>, Bhavna Yadav et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05221v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.05221v1</a></p>

<p>Determination of the leptonic CP-violating phase $δ_{\mathrm{CP}}$, the atmospheric mixing angle $θ_{23}$, and the mass-squared difference $Δm_{31}^{2}$ constitutes a primary objective of current and next-generation long-baseline neutrino experiments. We employ QFI (QFI) to establish fundamental precision bounds on single-parameter estimation in three-flavor $ν_μ\to ν_e$ oscillations, treating the neutrino as an evolving pure quantum state. Computing QFI as a function of the baseline-to-energy ratio $L/E$ for benchmark parameter sets from NuFit-6.0, we find distinct sensitivity hierarchies and $L/E$-dependent structures. Specifically, $δ_{\mathrm{CP}}$ and $θ_{23}$ exhibit bimodal QFI profiles with peaks at $L/E \sim 500$ and $1500~\mathrm{km/GeV}$, corresponding to the first and second oscillation maxima, reaching $F_Q(δ_{\mathrm{CP}}) \sim 0.15$ and $F_Q(θ_{23}) \sim 15$, respectively. In contrast, $Δm_{31}^{2}$ displays a unimodal structure peaking at $L/E \sim 1000$–$1200~\mathrm{km/GeV}$ with $F_Q(Δm_{31}^{2}) \sim 3 \times 10^{6}$, reflecting its role in setting the oscillation length scale.</p>

<p>2026-02-05, <strong>LiFE-SNS: LiF Experiment for keV-scale Sterile Neutrino Search</strong>, Y. C. Lee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05161v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.05161v1</a></p>

<p>The LiF Experiment for keV-scale Sterile Neutrino Search (LiFE-SNS) aims to probe sterile neutrinos through precision measurements of the tritium $β$ spectrum. Tritium nuclei are produced and embedded in LiF crystals via the ${}^{6}\mathrm{Li}(n,α){}^{3}\mathrm{H}$ reaction, allowing thermal calorimetric detection of $β$ decays with magnetic microcalorimeters (MMCs) operated at millikelvin temperatures. We present the detector configuration, background studies, and calibration method, including modeling of position-dependent response and characterization of detector nonlinearity. We also discuss potential sources of systematic uncertainty relevant to the sterile-neutrino search. While the first phase of LiFE-SNS has been completed, this paper focuses on calibration and detector characterization. The achieved performance enables precision $β$-spectrum measurements, and projected sensitivities indicate competitive reach in the keV mass region.</p>

<p>2026-02-05, <strong>Novel Signatures of Heavy Neutral Lepton at Muon Collider</strong>, Xue-Xin Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05158v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.05158v1</a></p>

<p>The Higgs-strahlung process $\ell^+\ell^-\to Z h$ is one of the most important production channels of the standard model Higgs boson $h$ at the lepton colliders. The cross section reaches the maximum value slightly above the threshold $\sqrt{s}\sim m_Z+m_h$, and decreases as $\sim 1/s$ at high energies. In the gauged extension models, the new gauge boson $Z’$ and heavy Higgs boson $H$ exist after the symmetry breaking. The heavy Higgs-strahlung process $\ell^+\ell^-\to Z’ H$ would also reach the maximum cross section around the threshold $\sqrt{s}\sim m_{Z’}+m_H$. Therefore, the future high energy lepton colliders, such as the TeV scale muon collider, are promising to probe this new process. If heavy neutral lepton $N$ is introduced to generate the tiny neutrino masses via seesaw mechanism, novel signatures could arise from $μ^+μ^-\to Z’ H \to NN +NN \to 4 μ^\pm +4J$ and $μ^+μ^-\to Z’ H \to μ^+μ^- +NN \to 3 μ^\pm μ^\mp +2J$, where the fat-jets $J$ come from the hadronic decay of $W$ bosons. In this paper, we investigate the same-sign tetralepton signature $4μ^\pm+4J$ and the same-sign trilepton signature $3μ^\pm μ^\mp + 2J$ at the 3 TeV and 10 TeV muon collider.</p>

<p>2026-02-05, <strong>Solar Flares as a Probe of Neutrino Nature: Distinguishing Dirac and Majorana via Resonant Spin-Flavor Precession</strong>, D. Delepine et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05149v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.05149v1</a></p>

<p>Resonant Spin-Flavor Precession (RSFP) of solar neutrinos is studied using the quantum density matrix formalism, explicitly taking into account collisional decoherence and solar matter density profiles. The transition probabilities for standard $^8$B solar neutrinos ($E \approx 10$ MeV) and ultra-high-energy flare neutrinos ($E \gtrsim 1$ GeV) under three magnetic field hypotheses: core-concentrated (Wood-Saxon), tachocline-confined (Gaussian), and turbulent convective (Power Law) are compared. For standard LMA parameters, we show the resonance for 10 MeV neutrinos is strictly confined to the deep solar core ($r &lt; 0.2 R_\odot$), rendering standard solar neutrinos insensitive to outer magnetic fields. Conversely, for 1 GeV flare neutrinos, the resonance shifts to the tachocline and convective zones, where strong fields ($B \sim 50$ kG) drive efficient spin conversion.   We apply this effect to compute the difference between Dirac or Majorana neutrino scattering cross section as electron-neutrino scattering and Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$ν$NS). We show that significant asymmetry in these cross section are possible allowing in case of detection to distinguish between Dirac or Majorana neutrinos. In case of null observation, we show that this method can potentially improved the limit on the neutrino magnetic moment by one order to magnitude compared to current limits.</p>

<p>2026-02-05, <strong>Improved Heavy Dark Matter Annihilation Search from Dwarf Galaxies with HAWC</strong>, A. Albert et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05955v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.05955v1</a></p>

<p>Understanding dark matter’s elusive nature is crucial for the framework of particle physics and expanding the Standard Model. This analysis utilizes the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma ray Observatory to indirectly search for dark matter (DM) by studying gamma ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Selected for their high ratio of dark matter to baryonic matter, dSphs are useful for this type of search owing to the low background emission. In comparison to previous HAWC studies, we significantly improve our sensitivity to DM from dSphs due to improvements to our event reconstruction and reduced hadronic contamination. We expanded the number of dSphs studied, DM annihilation channels into the Standard Model (SM), and the amount of data collected on each previously studied dSph. We searched for DM signals in each dSph using the latest version of the algorithms used to reconstruct data from the primary detector of the HAWC instrument. We report that we do not detect evidence of DM from dSphs, so we place upper limits for the velocity-weighted DM annihilation cross-section ($\langleσv \rangle$) on the order of $10^{-23}~\text{cm}^3\text{s}^{-1}$ for a DM mass range of $1-10^4$ TeV.</p>

<p>2026-02-05, <strong>Early growth of massive black holes in dynamical dark energy models with negative cosmological constant</strong>, N. Menci et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05921v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.05921v1</a></p>

<p>Recent results from combined cosmological probes indicate that the Dark Energy component of the Universe could be dynamical. The simplest explanation envisages the presence of a quintessence field rolling into a potential, where the Dark Energy energy density parameter $Ω_{DE}=Ω_Λ+Ω_{x}$ results from the contribution of the ground state energy $Ω_Λ$ and the scalar field energy $Ω_{x}$. Provided that $Ω_{DE}\approx 0.7$, negative values of $Ω_Λ$ can be consistent with current measurements from cosmological probes, and could help in explaining the large abundance of bright galaxies observed by JWST at $z&gt; 10$, largely exceeding the pre-JWST expectations in a $ΛCDM$ Universe. Here we explore to what extent such a scenario can account also for the early presence of massive Black Holes (BHs) with masses $M_{BH}\gtrsim 10^7\,M_{\odot}$ observed at $z\gtrsim 8$, and for the large over-abundance of AGN with respect to pre-JWST expectations. Our aim is not to provide a detailed description of BH growth, but rather to compute the maximal BH growth that can occur in cosmological models with negative $Ω_Λ$ under the simple assumption of Eddington-limited accretion onto initial light Black Hole seeds with mass $M_{seed}\sim 10^2\,M_{\odot}$ originated from PopIII stars. To this aim we develop a simple analytic framework to connect the growth of dark matter halos to the maximal growth of BHs within the above assumptions. We show such models can account for present observations assuming values of $Ω_Λ\approx -1$, simultaneously boosting both galaxy and AGN number counts without invoking any additional physics. This would allow us to trace the observed excess of bright and massive galaxies and the early formation of massive Black Holes and the abundance of AGN to the same cosmological origin.</p>

<p>2026-02-05, <strong>Microlensing constraint on Primordial Black Hole abundance with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam observations of Andromeda</strong>, Sunao Sugiyama et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05840v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.05840v1</a></p>

<p>We present updated microlensing analysis results based on high-cadence ($\sim$2~min) Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) in 2014, 2017, and 2020, yielding a total of 39.3 hours of data. We use a point-lens finite-source model for the microlensing light curve model and employ multi-stage selection procedures to identify microlensing candidates. From more than 25,000 variable candidates detected across all nights, we identify 12 microlensing candidates with light-curve timescales shorter than 5~hours, and among them, 4 secure candidates with high-significance detections. We estimate detection efficiencies using light-curve-level simulations that account for observational conditions and finite-source effects. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework that combines the light-curve fitting information for each candidate with the Poisson statistics of the number of candidates, we derive constraints on parameters that characterize the abundance and mass scale of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter. First, we derive upper limits on the PBH abundance under the null hypothesis that all events are assumed to be false detections. Next, employing the PBH hypothesis in which all (or only secure) candidates are assumed to be due to PBH microlensing, we derive the allowed region of the PBH parameters; the inferred mass scale is $M_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{-7}$–$10^{-6}M_\odot$, and the PBH abundance to the total dark matter is $f_{\rm PBH}\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-2}{\rm -}10^{-1})$. Our results demonstrate that HSC-M31 monitoring remains a uniquely powerful probe of PBHs, and highlight the need for further studies for example, using Rubin Observatory LSST observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud.</p>

<p>2026-02-05, <strong>STProtein: predicting spatial protein expression from multi-omics data</strong>, Zhaorui Jiang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05811v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.05811v1</a></p>

<p>The integration of spatial multi-omics data from single tissues is crucial for advancing biological research. However, a significant data imbalance impedes progress: while spatial transcriptomics data is relatively abundant, spatial proteomics data remains scarce due to technical limitations and high costs. To overcome this challenge we propose STProtein, a novel framework leveraging graph neural networks with multi-task learning strategy. STProtein is designed to accurately predict unknown spatial protein expression using more accessible spatial multi-omics data, such as spatial transcriptomics. We believe that STProtein can effectively addresses the scarcity of spatial proteomics, accelerating the integration of spatial multi-omics and potentially catalyzing transformative breakthroughs in life sciences. This tool enables scientists to accelerate discovery by identifying complex and previously hidden spatial patterns of proteins within tissues, uncovering novel relationships between different marker genes, and exploring the biological “Dark Matter”.</p>

<p>2026-02-05, <strong>Extended Haloscope Search and Candidate Validation near 1.036G Hz</strong>, Saebyeok Ahn et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05388v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.05388v1</a></p>

<p>We report a follow-up axion haloscope search near 1.036 GHz that completes and extends our previous work [Phys. Rev. X 14, 031023 (2024)], in which a portion of the HEMT-based data could not be analyzed due to unrecorded experimental information. While recovering this dataset, we identified an excess near 1.036 GHz that satisfied our candidate-selection criteria, motivating dedicated validation studies, including independent cross-checks and re-examination with the original apparatus. The excess did not persist under these investigations and was not confirmed as an axion dark-matter signal. We subsequently extended the search over a 20-MHz band surrounding the candidate using a quantum-noise-limited amplifier, achieving sensitivity close to the Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky benchmark. In the absence of a confirmed signal, we set improved 90% confidence-level upper limits on the axion-photon coupling over the frequency range 1.026-1.045 GHz.

<p>A Reissner-Nordström black hole (RNBH) enclosed in a cavity is known to be superradiantly unstable to charged scalar perturbations below a critical frequency. Inspired by the emergence of the QCD axion as a prominent dark matter candidate, we construct a model featuring an axion field coupled to an electromagnetic field that undergoes superradiant growth around an RNBH. Utilizing numerical relativity, we achieve stable, long-term evolution of this system and perform a comparative analysis across various parameter spaces. Our comprehensive investigation reveals the formation of a hairy black hole, whose final state is governed by a diverse set of physical parameters. Notably, the decay constant in the axion potential, representing nonlinear interactions, bifurcates the superradiant instability into two distinct behavioral regimes, leading to more significant dynamical shifts than previously reported. Furthermore, we examine the influence of the scalar field’s charge and mass, as well as the mirror’s position. We investigate the axionic bosenova process and observe a long-term beating pattern of the axion field induced by nonlinear interactions. By fine-tuning these parameter combinations, we demonstrate that the system can evolve toward a variety of distinct physical endpoints.</p>

<p>2026-02-05, <strong>Dark Energy After DESI DR2: Observational Status, Reconstructions, and Physical Models</strong>, Slava G. Turyshev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05368v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.05368v1</a></p>

<p>We review late-time cosmic acceleration after DESI Data Release~2 (DR2), emphasizing the interplay between Type~Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), anisotropic BAO, CMB calibration, and perturbation-sensitive probes (RSD and weak lensing). DESI DR2 delivers percent-level BAO distance ratios over $0\lesssim z\lesssim2.5$, including a Ly$α$-forest anchor at $z_{\rm eff}=2.33$. In CMB-calibrated combinations, flat $Λ$CDM exhibits a mild parameter mismatch, while allowing evolving dark energy (e.g.\ CPL $w_0$–$w_a$) can improve the fit; the preference is dataset-dependent and is particularly sensitive to redshift-dependent SN calibration/selection residuals at the few$\times10^{-2}$\,mag level. To sharpen likelihood-level interpretation, we provide two diagnostics: (i) an $r_d$-independent BAO-shape observable, $F_{\rm AP}(z)\equiv D_{\rm M}(z)/D_{\rm H}(z)$, constructed directly from published $(D_{\rm M}/r_d,\,D_{\rm H}/r_d)$ with covariance propagation; and (ii) a linear-response map from SN Hubble-diagram systematics $δμ(z)$ to induced biases in $(w_0,w_a)$, yielding an explicit calibration requirement for DESI-era claims of evolving $w(z)$. We synthesize parametric and non-parametric reconstructions of $w(z)$ and $ρ_{\rm DE}(z)$ and map the resulting phenomenology to microphysical dark-energy and modified-gravity models subject to perturbation stability and gravitational-wave propagation constraints.</p>
