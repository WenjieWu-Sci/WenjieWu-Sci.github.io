<p>2025-10-21, <strong>N-body Simulations of cosmologies with Light Massive Relics</strong>, Vikhyat Sharma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18797v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18797v1</a></p>

<p>The presence of additional relativistic particles at the time of recombination can be inferred through their contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. If these species have a finite but low mass (Light Massive Relics - LiMRs), they act as a hot subcomponent of dark matter and impact late-time structure formation. Understanding these effects will be crucial to pin down the underlying particle physics properties of any future $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ detection. While their impact has been well-studied on linear scales, this work develops the framework for and presents results from the first set of cosmological N-body simulations that can track the effects of LiMRs, as a function of their mass and temperature, down to fully nonlinear scales. Importantly, our simulations model the impact of both the massive Standard Model neutrinos and LiMRs, which will be crucial in disentangling possible degeneracies. We systematically explore the effects of LiMR properties such as mass, temperature, and initial distribution, on various cosmological observables, including the total matter power spectrum, Halo Mass Functions (HMF), Mass-Concentration relation, radial halo profiles, and weak lensing signals around massive clusters. The framework and simulations developed here will enable detailed follow-up of the rich phenomenology of LiMR cosmologies.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Integrated Luminosity with 100 ppm Precision, Methods for $\sqrt{s}$ Precision of 1 ppm, and Beyond Standard Model Sensitivity using Photonic Events, at $\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}$ Higgs Factories</strong>, Brendon Madison et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18666v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18666v1</a></p>

<p>Future electron-positron ($\ee$) colliders, operating as Higgs factories or Z factories, promise unprecedented precision electroweak measurements that are vital to testing the Standard Model (SM) and exploring physics beyond it. Here we present work on the precision of integrated luminosity ($\mathcal{L}$) and center-of-mass energy ($\sqrt{s}$), measurements that are needed to make future precision measurements possible. We also conduct these studies for the International Linear Collider (ILC) from the Z pole ($m_{Z}$) to 1~TeV to provide a comprehensive study of these issues for future $\ee$ colliders. Paths to 100 parts-per-million (ppm) precision on $\mathcal{L}$ are presented, with focus on small-angle Bhabha scattering (SABS) and two-photon production (diphotons, $\gamma\gamma$). Previous studies found that beam deflection of SABS events introduce biases on $\mathcal{L}$ of $10^{-2}$. To address this, we present a novel method that uses M\o{}ller scattering with SABS to measure beam deflection and minimize its effect on $\mathcal{L}$. We present a proposal for a Highly Granular Luminosity Calorimeter, the GLIP LumiCal, and its design considerations. We demonstrate that the GLIP LumiCal can achieve $\approx35$ ppm precision on $\mathcal{L}$ precision with diphotons for all values of $\sqrt{s}$ and that the current LumiCal design is insufficient for reaching 1000 ppm. Multiple methods for precision $\sqrt{s}$ estimation are presented. We introduce the use of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to ensure that $\sqrt{s}$ is measured accurately and precisely The utility of photon measurements is extended to photon with invisible ($X^0\gamma$) events where we demonstrate methods to measure left-handed and right-handed neutrino couplings and put constraints on Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Comprehensive analysis of dissipative effects in the induced gravitational waves</strong>, Yan-Heng Yu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18663v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18663v1</a></p>

<p>Dissipation is an intrinsic property of the cosmic fluid, leading to the damping of curvature perturbations at small scales. In this paper, we comprehensively study dissipative effects in gravitational waves induced by curvature perturbations, known as induced gravitational waves (IGWs). We find dissipative effects become especially significant at wavenumber $k \sim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$, where $k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ corresponds to the horizon scale at the decoupling of weakly-interacting particles. They can leave characteristic features on the IGW spectrum, including a notable suppression with a ``double-valleyââ structure at $k \sim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ and a modified infrared behavior without logarithmic running at $k \lesssim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$. Within the Standard Model of particle physics, dissipative effects caused by neutrinos at the nanohertz frequencies can be important in the analysis of pulsar timing array data. Furthermore, dissipation-induced features associated with possible new weakly-interacting particles can be detectable by a wide range of gravitational-wave experiments, serving as a promising probe of new physics at extremely high energy scales. As an extension, we also discuss dissipative effects in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity and their impacts on the anisotropies of IGWs and the poltergeist mechanism. These dissipative effects not only provide a more realistic description of IGWs but also exhibit rich phenomenology and profound physical implications, opening a new window into understanding the early Universe and fundamental physics.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Heavy Neutral Lepton at Same-Sign Muon Collider</strong>, Ryuichiro Kitano et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18390v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18390v1</a></p>

<p>We explore the discovery potential of heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), motivated by models addressing the origin of neutrino masses, at the proposed high-energy same-sign muon collider known as $\mu$TRISTAN. The study focuses on two complementary HNL-mediated signatures: (i) the lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) channel $\mu^+\mu^+ \to W^+\tau^+\bar\nu_\mu$ and (ii) the lepton-number-violating (LNV) channel $\mu^{+}\mu^{+} \to W^{+}W^{+}$. The LNV process is the muon analogue of inverse neutrinoless double beta decay and, if observed, would provide strong evidence for Majorana neutrinos, while the LFV process offers a novel probe of flavor-changing neutral currents in the lepton sector. At the $\mu$TRISTAN collider with $\sqrt{s} \sim \mathcal{O}(10)~\text{TeV}$, the resulting sensitivity to the HNL mixing with muon and tau neutrinos, as a function of mass, can surpass current bounds from the measurements of electroweak precision observables over a broad mass range. In particular, for the mixing with muon neutrinos, the collider bound can improve by an order of magnitude for $5$-$10$ TeV HNLs.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Neutrino Dipole Portal</strong>, Sin Kyu Kang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18181v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18181v1</a></p>

<p>The neutrino dipole portal (NDP) is a minimal and predictive extension of the Standard Model, in which a transition magnetic moment operator couples an active neutrino to a heavy neutral lepton via the electromagnetic field. This higher-dimensional interaction gives rise to distinctive processes such as neutrino up-scattering, radiative decays, meson transitions, and modifications of recoil spectra, offering multiple avenues for discovery. In this review, we discuss the theoretical foundations of the NDP, its ultraviolet completions, and the associated production and decay mechanisms across laboratory, astrophysical, and cosmological settings. Current constraints arise from accelerator searches, recoil-based detectors, collider studies, and high energy neutrino observatories, complemented by robust bounds from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the Cosmic Microwave Background, and supernova cooling. Future experimental and observational efforts, including next-generation neutrino experiments, multi-ton dark matter detectors, and improved cosmological and astrophysical probes, are anticipated to test the remaining allowed regions. The NDP thus provides a simple, well-motivated, and broadly testable framework at the intersection of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>Constraints on the Correlation of IceCube Neutrinos with Tracers of Large-Scale Structure</strong>, R. Abbasi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18119v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18119v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed extragalactic astrophysical neutrinos with an apparently isotropic distribution. Only a small fraction of the observed astrophysical neutrinos can be explained by known sources. Neutrino production is thought to occur in energetic environments that are ultimately powered by the gravitational collapse of dense regions of the large-scale mass distribution in the universe. Whatever their identity, neutrino sources likely trace this large-scale mass distribution. The clustering of neutrinos with a tracer of the large-scale structure may provide insight into the distribution of neutrino sources with respect to redshift and the identity of neutrino sources. We implement a two-point angular cross-correlation of the Northern sky track events with an infrared galaxy catalog derived from WISE and 2MASS source catalogs that trace the nearby large-scale structure. No statistically significant correlation is found between the neutrinos and this infrared galaxy catalog. We find that &lt; ~54% of the diffuse muon neutrino flux can be attributed to sources correlated with the galaxy catalog with 90% confidence. Additionally, when assuming that the neutrino source comoving density evolves following a power-law in redshift, $dN_s/dV \propto (1+z)^{k}$, we find that sources with negative evolution, in particular k &lt; -1.75, are disfavored at the 90% confidence level</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>Three decades of FCNC studies in 3-3-1 model with right-handed neutrinos: from $Z^\prime$ - dominance to the alignment limit</strong>, Patricio Escalona et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17979v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.17979v1</a></p>

<p>Flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes play a prominent role in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) due to their sensitivity to new physics at the TeV scale. Meson-antimeson transitions and rare meson decays provide stringent constraints on new physics through precision measurements of observables such as mass differences, CP asymmetries, and branching ratios. Extensions of the SM based on the $\text{SU}(3)_C \times \text{SU}(3)_L \times \text{U}(1)_N$ gauge group offer a compelling framework for flavor physics, as FCNC processes emerge inexorably at tree level due to the non-universal transformations of the quark families. Among its various realizations, the version incorporating right-handed neutrinos (331RHN) is the most phenomenologically viable. This review synthesizes three decades of theoretical developments in FCNC phenomenology within the 331RHN model, from early $Z^\prime$-dominated studies to the recent recognition of the decisive role played by the SM-like Higgs boson and the identification of the alignment limit. We demonstrate that viable parameter space spans orders of magnitude, from $m_{Z^\prime} \sim$ a few hundred GeV to $\sim 100$ TeV, depending critically on quark mixing parametrizations and scalar alignment configurations, with significant implications for experimental searches at current and future colliders.</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>Extracting SASI signatures from Gravitational Waves of Core-Collapse Supernovae using the Hilbert-Huang Transform</strong>, Alessandro Veutro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17636v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.17636v1</a></p>

<p>Core collapse supernovae are among the most energetic astrophysical events in the Universe. Despite huge efforts on understanding the main ingredients triggering such explosions, we still lack of compelling evidences for the precise mechanism driving those phenomena. They are expected to produce gravitational waves due to asymmetric mass motions in the collapsing core, and emit in the meanwhile neutrinos as a result of the interactions in their high-density environment. The combination of these two cosmic messengers can provide a unique probe to study the inner engine of these processes and unveil the explosion mechanism. Among the possible detectable signature, standing accretion shock instabilities (SASI) are particularly relevant in this context as they establish a direct connection between gravitational wave emission and the outcoming neutrino flux. In this work, Hilbert-Huang transform is applied to a selected sample of 3D numerical simulations, with the aim of identifying SASI contribution and extract its instantaneous frequency. The performance of the method is evaluated in the context of Einstein Telescope.</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>Leptonic first-row correlation and non-unitarity waiting for direct JUNO and Daya Bay precision tests</strong>, Zhi-zhong Xing et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17583v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.17583v1</a></p>

<p>We conjecture that there exists a remarkable correlation among the three elements in the first row of the $3\times 3$ lepton flavor mixing matrix $U$: $|U^{}_{e1}|^2 = 2 \left(|U^{}_{e2}|^2 + |U^{}_{e3}|^2\right)$, which holds even though $U$ is non-unitary in the canonical seesaw mechanism. This ``first-row correlationâ is fully consistent with $\sin^2\theta^{}_{12} = \left(1 - 2\tan^2\theta^{}_{13}\right)/3$ for the two active neutrino mixing angles derived from the TM1 flavor mixing pattern, and it will be {\it directly} tested by the upcoming JUNO precision data combined with the Daya Bay precision measurement.</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>Highlights from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</strong>, Alexander Kappes et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17523v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.17523v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube neutrino observatory has been successfully operating in its full configuration for almost 15 years and is characterized by a remarkably high stability and uptime. During this time, it has made many groundbreaking observations, such as the first detection of a high-energy diffuse cosmic neutrino flux or, more recently, the identification of the AGN NGC1068 as a steady source of high-energy neutrino emission and the observation of neutrinos from the Milky Way. In this talk, new developments in these areas will be discussed and further highlights presented. The second part then looks at the ongoing developments at the South Pole with IceCube Upgrade and IceCube-Gen2 and discusses their potential for advancing neutrino and astroparticle physics.</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>The Dark Matters at ICRC 2025</strong>, Milena CrnogorÄeviÄ et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17473v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.17473v1</a></p>

<p>The dark matter track at ICRC~2025 showed a field in transition. Direct detection has entered the \emph{neutrino-floor era}, with XENONnT and PandaX-4T now limited by Solar neutrinos. Indirect searches have become truly \emph{multimessenger}, combining $\gamma$-rays, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and radio data under unified likelihoods and shared systematics. Non-WIMP candidates â axions, sub-GeV particles, primordial black holes, macroscopic relics â are becoming central. Across all fronts, progress depends as much on new detectors as on the coherence of shared data, methods, and analysis frameworks. Here, I distill the main experimental and conceptual shifts behind these trends, noting how assumptions have evolved since ICRC~2023 and where the next decisive advances are likely to come.</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>Energy calibration of bulk events in the BULLKID detector</strong>, M. Folcarelli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17423v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.17423v1</a></p>

<p>BULLKID is a cryogenic, solid-state detector designed for direct searches of particle Dark Matter candidates, with mass $\lesssim 1$ GeV/c$^2$, and coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering. It is based on an array of dice carved in 5 mm thick silicon crystal, sensed by phonon-mediated Kinetic Inductance Detectors. In previous works, the array was calibrated with bursts of optical photons, which are absorbed in the first hundreds nanometers of the dice and give rise to surface events. In this work, we present the reconstruction of bulk events through the 59.5 keV $\gamma$-ray generated by an $^{241}$Am source, which emulates more closely the interaction of Dark Matter and neutrinos. The peak resolution is $5\%~(\sigma)$ and its position is shifted by less than $10\%$ with respect to the optical calibration. We observe that the resolution is further improved by a factor $2$ combining the signal from neighboring dice. These results confirm the performance of the detector in view of the physics goals of the BULLKID-DM experiment for dark matter search.</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>High Quality QCD Axion in the Standard Model</strong>, Jie Sheng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17370v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.17370v1</a></p>

<p>Although the axion is the most compelling solution to the strong CP problem, the ad hoc introduced global Peccei-Quinn symmetry suffers from a severe fine-tuning problem known as the quality problem. In this Letter, we show that the discrete gauge symmetry $\mathbb Z_4 \times \mathbb Z_3$ motivated from the internal structure of the Standard Model can naturally predict a high-quality axion, leading to a distinct and testable parameter space. Remarkably, this minimal framework simultaneously accounts for neutrino masses, baryon asymmetry, and dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>A radiative seesaw model in a non-invertible selection rule with the assistance of a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry</strong>, Shilpa Jangid et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17292v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.17292v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a two-loop neutrino mass model where fermionic and bosonic dark matter (DM) candidates are simultaneously connected to the neutrinos. But the fermionic DM candidate is favored compared to the bosonic one due to generating the fermionic DM mass at one-loop level. In order to obtain our desired Lagrangian and Higgs potential, we introduce a $Z_3$ gauging TY non-invertible fusion rule with the assistance of a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry. The fusion rule forbids the mass of DM candidate at tree level but its mass is generated at one-loop level where the DM mass term dynamically violates the fusion rule. After that, the neutrino mass matrix is induced at one-loop level where a remnant $Z_2$ symmetry is still remained. The symmetry assures the stability of our DM candidate. The non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry plays a role in forbidding the interactions between the SM particles and heavier fermions $X_R$ and an isospin singlet inert scalar boson $S_0$ that run in the DM mass loop, in addition to reduction our free parameters that leads to our predictions for lepton sector. We perform $\chi^2$ numerical analysis for the lepton masses, mixing angles, and phases, and we show several predictions for NH and IH. Then, we demonstrate our lepton flavor violations, muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment, and the relic density of the DM candidate fixing the best fit point of the lepton sector.</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>Radiative lepton model in a non-invertible fusion rule</strong>, Takaaki Nomura et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17156v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.17156v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a radiatively induced lepton mass model introducing a $Z_2$ gauging $Z_5$ fusion rule. In our framework, the charged-lepton mass matrix is generated at one loop level via dynamical breaking of the fusion rule. On the other hand, the neutrino mass matrix is induced at one-loop level without breaking the fusion rule. As a direct consequence of the loop induced charged lepton masses, we can also consider lepton flavor violations, electron and muon $g-2$, and charged-lepton electric dipole moments that come into our valid phenomenological discussion. Then, we perform numerical analysis and show some interesting tendency on Dirac CP phase, two Majorana phases, charged-lepton electric dipole moments and the neutrinoless double beta decay, all of which depends on their arguments where we fix the absolute values of our free parameters in order to satisfy experimental data of the lepton masses and mixing angles.</p>

Luo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17082v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.17082v1</a></p>

<p>The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a 20 kton multi-purpose low background liquid scintillator detector, was proposed primarily to determine the neutrino mass ordering. To mitigate radioactivity from surrounding rock and enable cosmic muon tagging, its central detector is immersed in a Water Cherenkov Detector (WCD) containing 40~ktons of ultrapure water instrumented with 2400 20-inch micro-channel plate photomultiplier tubes. Stringent radiopurity requirements mandate a radon concentration below 10 ~mBq/m$^3$ in the WCD. To achieve this, we developed a two-stage (ground and underground) ultrapure water system with 100~t/h production capacity, integrating a five-stage degassing membrane for radon removal. A novel microbubble technique was implemented to optimize the degassing membranesâ radon removal efficiency. The synergistic combination of the microbubble technology and the multistage degassing membranes achieved a radon removal efficiency exceeding 99.9\%, reducing the systemâs output to 0.61 $\pm$ 0.50~mBq/m$^3$ in recirculation mode, surpassing design specifications and establishing world-leading performance standards. This paper details the ultrapure system architecture, quantifies the radon contributions of each device, and presents a comprehensive study on microbubble-augmented membrane degassing for low radon ultra-pure water production in a 100~t/h water system.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Beware of the running $n_s$ when producing heavy primordial black holes</strong>, Sasha Allegrini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18791v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18791v1</a></p>

<p>We examine single-field inflationary models for the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By analyzing the latest observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)~\cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim}, we demonstrate that the observed preference for positive running ($\alpha_s$) of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ imposes significant restrictions on the parameter space of ultra slow roll scenarios (USR). This tension becomes progressively pronounced for more massive PBHs, posing substantial challenges for USR models to yield a detectable PBH abundance, especially in the mass range probed by ongoing and future gravitational-wave experiments such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). However, this discrepancy is minimal for asteroid-mass PBHs, which are still capable of feasibly constituting the entirety of dark matter (DM). To numerically probe the six-dimensional parameter space of polynomial models, we adapted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to efficiently scan over the space of viable models. Our results further indicate that, in non-minimally coupled polynomial inflation, a viable cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is best obtained at an inflection point for which second-order slow-roll approximation is necessary for precise CMB predictions.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>The Muonic Portal to Vector Dark Matter:connecting precision muon physics, cosmology, and colliders</strong>, Alexander Belyaev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18564v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18564v1</a></p>

<p>We present a comprehensive study of the Muonic Portal to Vector Dark Matter (MPVDM), a minimal yet phenomenologically rich extension of the Standard Model featuring a new SU(2)_D gauge symmetry and vector-like muons. In this framework the dark sector interacts with the Standard Model only through these heavy leptons, linking dark matter and the muon sector. The MPVDM can simultaneously explain the observed relic abundance and the muon anomalous magnetic moment a_mu under both the âtensionâ and âcompatibilityâ scenarios motivated by recent (g-2)_mu results. A key finding is a generic off-resonance velocity suppression mechanism that allows light (&lt;1 GeV) vector dark matter to evade CMB limits near 2*m_DM ~ m_H_D. Unlike scenarios based on ultra narrow Breit-Wigner resonances and early kinetic decoupling, the suppression follows from the temperature evolution of the annihilation cross section in a moderately detuned near resonant regime, where being 10-20 percent below resonance gives the required CMB era suppression without fine tuning. A five dimensional parameter scan shows that the tension scenario requires sub GeV dark matter with g_D ~ 1e-3 and TeV scale vector like muons, while the compatibility scenario admits a broad mass range up to multi TeV. Recasting ATLAS and CMS searches for mu+ mu- + E_T^miss sets a lower bound of about 850 GeV on vector like muons. The MPVDM thus offers a unified, predictive, and experimentally accessible framework linking dark matter and muon physics across cosmological and collider frontiers.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Raising galaxy rotation curves via dressing</strong>, J. FranÃ§ois et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18549v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18549v1</a></p>

<p>We present a manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant simple model of galaxy dynamics obtained by applying the Dressing Field Method (DFM) to a general-relativistic system comprising the metric and four scalar fields, phenomenologically representing the four-velocity of a cosmological fluid or dust field. The DFM, a systematic tool for extracting the gauge-invariant content in general-relativistic theories, provides a physical coordinatization that yields corrective terms to the rotational velocity profile. These corrections produce galaxy rotation curves that combine a Keplerian and a constant velocity terms, effectively emulating a Dark Matter contribution. We compare DFM-derived rotation curves to observed data for spiral galaxies, from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database, showing that the DFM allows to fit them well.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Towards a Post-Inflationary Composite Axion Model</strong>, Aleksandr Azatov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18538v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18538v1</a></p>

<p>Composite axions offer a scenario where the axion emerges as a pion-like state, avoiding fine-tuning of elementary scalars and ameliorating the axion quality problem. Despite these advantages, their post-inflationary cosmology remains largely unexplored, with challenges including the domain wall problem and the presence of exotic relics. We propose two composite axion models with an effective domain wall number $N_\text{DW} = 1$ and study the dilution of relics via a short period of inflation. One model is based on an $SU(5)$ chiral gauge theory, while the other employs a ``gaugedââ $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry in vector-like $SU(N)$ gauge theories. We identify the viable parameter space in which axion strings re-enter the horizon before or even after the QCD transition and axion dark matter is dominantly produced from the decay of the string-wall network.</p>

<p>Some new-generation dark matter detection experiments are primarily designed to search for the dark matter-electron interactions, but they can also be utilized to probe models in which dark matter couples exclusively to nucleon via the quantum effects. The hadronic loop-induced interactions can directly excite plasmons in semiconductors, thereby providing an additional channel for detecting the leptophobic dark matter. In this work, we investigate plasmon excitations in silicon detectors induced by boosted dark matter and cosmic-ray up-scattering dark matter via the hadronic loop process. By analyzing the available experimental data, we derive new exclusion limits on the leptophobic dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section.</p>

<p>We present the $\mathtt{WebSky}$ $\mathrm{[CII]}$ line-intensity mock maps and forecast the capabilities of upcoming wide-field submillimeter-wave surveys of cosmological $\mathrm{[CII]}$ emission from the epoch of reionization (EoR). Using the $\mathtt{Peak~Patch}$ algorithm to generate light-cone dark matter (DM) halo catalogues and the $\mathtt{WebSky}$ framework to forward-model the cosmological $\mathrm{[CII]}$ signal, we construct tomographic mock surveys matched to the CCAT Observatory. We investigate both astrophysical models of $\mathrm{[CII]}$ emission from interstellar gas and the potential for the study of primordial intermittent non-Gaussianity (PING) as a science case for Stage 2 line intensity mapping (LIM) surveys. The $\mathrm{[CII]}$ voxel intensity distribution (VID) is used as a summary statistic in forecasts. Additional constraints on PING are derived from a relative entropy study of $\mathtt{Peak~Patch}$ halo mass functions. We show that upcoming LIM surveys will provide insights into the way we model cosmological line emission, and next-generation surveys can place competitive bounds on novel inflationary scenarios such as PING. The $\mathtt{WebSky}$ $\mathrm{[CII]}$ mocks and corresponding $\mathtt{Peak~Patch}$ halo catalogues are publicly available at https://uoft.me/webskycii .</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Quantum improved wormholes in the Dekel-Zhao dark matter halo</strong>, Jonathan A. RebouÃ§as et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18264v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18264v1</a></p>

<p>This work presents and investigates novel traversable wormhole solutions within the framework of Asymptotically Safe Gravity (ASG), sourced by a dark matter halo modeled by the DekelâZhao density profile. The scale-dependent gravitational coupling $G(k)$, derived from the ASG renormalization group flow in the infrared regime, is incorporated directly into the field equations, providing a consistent description of quantum gravitational corrections even at astrophysical scales. The combined effects of the running coupling (parameterized by $\xi$) and the dark matter characteristics determine the geometric structure and physical viability of the wormhole. The solutions satisfy the flare-out and asymptotic flatness conditions within restricted parameter domains, exhibiting enhanced curvature near the throat due to ASG corrections. Null Energy Conditions are necessarily violated at the throat, and stability analysis based on the adiabatic sound speed as well as the modified TolmanâOppenheimerâVolkoff equation reveal that quantum effects from ASG counteract the destabilizing influence of dark matter. Phenomenologically, the wormhole shadow radius increases nearly linearly with $\xi$, lying within the Event Horizon Telescope bounds for Sgr~A$^*$ when $\xi/M \simeq 0.8â0.9$, thus suggesting that ASG-corrected wormholes may represent observable signatures of quantum gravity in the strong-field regime.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Milky Way Mass Through Escape Velocity Curve from LAMOST K Giants</strong>, Yin Wu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18227v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18227v1</a></p>

<p>Escape velocity has long been used to constrain the mass of the Dark Matter (DM) halo in the Milky Way (MW). Here we present a study of the escape velocity curve using a sample of high-velocity K giants with full 6D phase-space information and relatively good quality, selected from LAMOST DR8 and cross-matched with Gaia DR3. To expand the high-velocity stars to larger distances, we used radius-dependent criteria of total velocity, that is, $v_{\rm GC}&gt;300\;\rm{km s^{-1}}$ for the solar neighborhood; $v_{\rm GC}&gt;v_{\rm min}\sim0.6\times v_{\rm esc}(r_{\rm GC})$ for outer region. We also selected halo stars based on $v_{\phi}-{\rm [Fe/H]}$ information to ensure that the sample is isotropic. We modeled the velocity distribution with traditional power-law models to determine the escape velocity in each radial bin. For the first time, we have directly measured a relatively continuous escape velocity curve that can extend to Galactocentric radii of $\sim 50$ kpc, finding a decline in agreement with previous studies. The escape velocity at the solar position yielded by our measurements is $523.74^{+12.83}_{-13.47}\;\rm{km s^{-1}}$. Combined with the local circular velocity, we estimated the mass of the MW assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White DM profile, which resulted in a total mass of $M_{200,\;\rm{total}}=0.90_{-0.07}^{+0.06}\times 10^{12}\;M_{\odot}$, with a concentration of $c_{200}=13.47_{-1.70}^{+1.85}$. The small uncertainty implies that including the escape velocities beyond the solar neighborhood can result in a more precise mass estimate. Our derived MW mass is consistent with some recent studies using the escape velocity as well as other tracers, which may support a lower mass of the DM halo than in the past.</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter: From Phenomenology to Astrophysical Observables</strong>, M. Grant Roberts et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18142v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18142v1</a></p>

<p>We develop a minimal, testable framework for two-component self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) in which a dominant, moderately self-interacting species coexists with an ultra-strongly self-interacting subcomponent (uSIDM). A light vector mediator induces velocity-dependent self-scattering, while early-universe dynamics - standard $2 \to 2$ annihilation supplemented by interconversion $\chi_1\chi_1 \to \chi_2\chi_2$ - determine the relic abundance analytically. From observations of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxy rotation curves, as well as strong cluster lensing, we place constraints on the microphysics parameters. From these constrained regions, we map the microphysics to effective \texttt{ETHOS} parameters and evolve the linear power spectrum in \texttt{CLASS}. We then confront the model with direct-detection constraints and place an upper bound on our parameter space. We identify a region where: (1) the SIDM dominant component attains $\sigma_{\rm{eff}}/m = 20 - 40~\text{cm}^{2}\text{g}^{-1}$ at dwarf velocities while satisfying cluster upper bounds $\sigma_{\rm{eff}}/m &lt; 0.13~\rm{cm}^{2}\rm{g}^{-1}$; (2) a subpercent uSIDM fraction drives accelerated gravothermal collapse in early halos, providing seeds relevant to high-redshift quasar formation and ``little red dotsââ; and (3) the small-scale cutoff in the matter power spectrum remains consistent with Lyman-$\alpha$ and satellite counts, but exhibits non-standard features, potentially discernible with future observations. The allowed space can be organized by the mediator-to-DM mass ratio and the late-time uSIDM fraction, with a narrow window singled out by the combined cosmological and astrophysical requirements.</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>Solar Reflected Dark Matter under the Influence of Dark Magnetic Field</strong>, Haoming Nie et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18028v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18028v1</a></p>

<p>The scattering of dark matter particles within the Sunâs hot plasma can lead to acceleration of dark matter, producing a high-energy solar-reflected DM flux detectable in ground-based experiments. In the vector portal model, interactions between dark matter and Standard Model particles are mediated by a hidden vector fieldâreferred to as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dark photon"--which kinetically mixes with the conventional photon through a small mixing angle. Furthermore, the solar plasma generates intense magnetic fields. Due to the photon-dark photon mixing, this simultaneously sources a</code>dark magnetic fieldâ. For sufficiently low dark photon masses, this dark magnetic field is capable of deflecting dark matter particles traversing the Sun. We found that if the dark magnetic force is sufficiently strong, the dark magnetic field becomes a wall, preventing the dark matter particles from reaching the deep core region, suppressing their reflected flux. This scenario correct the sensitivity of solar-reflected dark matter detection, offering critical insights for ground-based experiments aiming to probe dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>Testing the Stellar Feedback-driven Breathing Mode in Low-mass Galaxies with Gas Kinematics</strong>, Yifei Luo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17996v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.17996v1</a></p>

<p>Hydrodynamic simulations have proposed that stellar feedback and bursty star-formation can produce dark matter cores in low-mass galaxies. A key prediction is that feedback-driven gas outflow and inflow cycles can lead to ``breathing modesââ (rapid fluctuations in the global gravitational potential) which drive correlated variations in galaxy size, kinematics, and star-formation rate. In this paper, we test the dynamical effects of feedback-driven breathing modes using a sample of 103 star-forming low-mass galaxies with stellar masses between $7.9&lt;\rm \log M_*/M_\odot&lt;9.6$ and $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.19$. We measure ionized gas velocity dispersions from H$\alpha$ emission lines and compare them to mock observations from the FIRE-2 simulations. We compare gas velocity dispersions ($\rm \sigma_{gas}$), stellar masses, and specific star-formation rates (sSFR). We find a positive correlation between gas velocity dispersion residuals at fixed stellar masses ($\rm \Delta\sigma_{gas}$) and sSFR in both data and simulations. However, the relation is tighter in FIRE-2 compared to the data. FIRE-2 produces more low-sSFR galaxies compared to our observational sample, however, the sSFR distributions agree after limiting both samples to a minimum sSFR. A deeper and more complete photometric sample further indicates that observed low-mass galaxies could span the full range of sSFR predicted in the FIRE-2 simulations. Our results support the existence of short-timescale dynamical effects driven by gas outflow and inflow cycles in low-mass galaxies and motivate additional tests of the breathing mode.</p>

<p>We study collider constraints on the near-continuum dark matter model, in which the dark sector consists of a tower of closely spaced states with weak-scale masses coupled to the Standard Model through a $Z$-portal. To capture this structure in a model-agnostic way, we introduce a minimal parameterization that encodes the dominant geometric information with three parameters. Using a custom-built Monte-Carlo tool for near-continuous spectra, we simulate DM-pair production at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and subsequent cascade decays via on/off-shell $Z$ bosons, which yield events with large missing transverse momentum and high jet multiplicity. Recasting the CMS multijet$+H_T^{\rm miss}$ analysis of Run-2 data (35.9 fb$^{-1}$), we derive bounds on the model parameter space. Extrapolating these bounds, we provide High-Luminosity LHC projections (3 ab$^{-1}$). We also project sensitivities for future electron-positron colliders at $\sqrt{s}=365$ GeV and $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV, showing substantial improvements over the HL-LHC. The current LHC sensitivity is beginning to approach the theoretically motivated region of the parameter space, while future colliders will be able to comprehensively test this model.</p>

<p>We explore the growth of structure in multi-species wave (and particle) dark matter. We derive the evolution of the power spectrum of total density contrasts for an arbitrary number of component species, density fractions, and initial field power spectra. We also derive cross-spectra for density correlations across or within individual species. Our framework includes cold and warm wave dark matter, which can give rise to significant intrinsic Poisson-like density fluctuations along with scale-dependent evolution connected to the free-streaming and Jeans scales. Such dark matter components could be globally or locally misaligned scalar fields as well as multi-component fields with spin $&gt;0$. The framework also includes cold and warm particle dark matter in the appropriate limits.</p>

<p>Light scalar particles arise naturally in many extensions of the Standard Model and are well-motivated dark matter candidates. Gravitational interactions near black holes can trigger the growth of dense scalar configurations that, if sustained during inspiral, alter binary dynamics and imprint signatures on gravitational-wave signals. Detecting such effects would provide a novel probe of fundamental physics and dark matter. Here we develop a semi-analytic waveform model for binaries in scalar environments, validated against numerical relativity simulations, and apply it in a Bayesian analysis of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog. Our results set physically meaningful upper bounds on scalar environments around compact binaries. When superradiance priors are included, we find tentative evidence for such an environment in GW190728 with $\ln B_{\mathrm{vac}}^{\mathrm{env}} \approx 3.5$, which would correspond to the existence of a light scalar field with mass $\sim 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>Using Strong Lensing to Detect Subhalos with Steep Inner Density Profiles</strong>, Kassidy E. Kollmann et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17956v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.17956v1</a></p>

<p>The inner region of a subhaloâs density distribution is particularly sensitive to dark matter microphysics, with alternative dark matter models leading to both cored and steeply-rising inner density profiles. This work investigates how the lensing signature and detectability of dark matter subhalos in mock HST-, Euclid-, and JWST-like strong lensing observations depends on the subhaloâs radial density profile, especially with regards to the inner power-law slope, $\beta$. We demonstrate that the minimum-mass subhalo detectable along the Einstein ring of a system is strongly dependent on $\beta$. In particular, we show that subhalos with $\beta \sim 2.2$ can be detected down to masses over an order-of-magnitude lower than their Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) counterparts with $\beta \sim 1$. Importantly, we find that the detectability of subhalos with steep inner profiles is minimally affected by increasing the complexity of the main lens galaxyâs mass model. This is a unique characteristic of these subhalos, as those with NFW or shallower profiles become essentially undetectable when multipole perturbations are added to the lens model. The results of this work highlight how the underlying dark matter physics can significantly impact the expected number of subhalo detections from strong gravitational lensing observations. This is important for testing Cold Dark Matter against alternatives, such as Self-Interacting Dark Matter, which predict the existence of subhalos with diverse inner density profiles.</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>Phantom scalar field with arbitrary potential: accelerating scaling attractors</strong>, Sudip Halder et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17765v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.17765v1</a></p>

<p>In this article, we investigate the dynamics of a phantom scalar field with an arbitrary potential, focusing on accelerating scaling solutions of cosmological relevance. We consider both uncoupled and coupled cosmological scenarios. In the latter case, the coupling between phantom dark energy and dark matter is motivated by the warm inflationary paradigm, with the dissipation coefficient assumed to be either constant or variable. The evolution equations of our coupled and uncoupled cosmological models are written in the form of autonomous systems, whose stability is studied using methods of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. For this analysis, the only requirement imposed on the phantom scalar-field potential is that a specific dynamical variable, defined in terms of the potential and its derivative, must be invertible. We show that the uncoupled phantom cosmological model cannot accommodate any accelerated scaling solution, while such solutions do exist in the coupled scenario, for both constant and variable dissipation coefficients. Although there is a limitation to these scaling solutions $-$ specifically, the current stage of accelerated expansion is not preceded by a long enough matter-dominated era $-$ our results show that the existence of a direct coupling between phantom dark energy and dark matter yields great potential for addressing the cosmic coincidence problem.</p>

<p>Under carefully chosen assumptions a single general relativistic scalar field is able to induce MOND-like dynamics in the weak field approximation of the Einstein frame (gauge) and to modify the light cone structure accordingly. This is shown by a Lagrangian model formulated in the framework of integrable Weyl geometry. It contains a Bekenstein-type (``aquadraticââ) term and a second order term generating additional mass energy for the scalar field. Both are switched on only if the gradient of the scalar field is spacelike and below a MOND-typical threshold, like in the superfluid model of Berezhiani/Khoury. The mass term induces non-negligible energy and pressures of the scalar field and leads to gravitational light deflection compatible with MOND-ian free fall trajectories. In the weak field (Newton-Milgrom) approximation the Bekenstein term implies a deep MOND equation for the scalar field. In this model the external field effect of the MOND approach has to be reconsidered. This has important consequences for hierarchical systems like clusters, which may suffice for explaining their dynamics without additional dark matter.</p>

<p>The BULLKID-DM experiment aims to detect WIMP-like potential Dark Matter particles with masses below 1 GeV/c^2. Sensing these particles is challenging, as it requires nuclear recoil detectors characterized by high exposure and an energy threshold in the order of 100 eV, thus exceeding the capabilities of conventional semiconductor detectors. BULLKID-DM intends to tackle this challenge by using cryogenic Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) with exceptional energy thresholds to sense a target with a total mass of 800 g across 16 wafers, divided into over 2000 individually instrumented silicon dice. The MKIDs on each wafer are coupled to a single transmission line and read using a frequency division multiplexing approach by the room-temperature data acquisition.   In this contribution, we describe and assess the design of the room-temperature readout electronics system, including the selected hardware components and the FPGA firmware which contains the real-time signal processing stages for tone generation, frequency demultiplexing, and event triggering. We evaluate the system on the ZCU216 board, a commercial evaluation card built around a Radio-Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) with integrated high-speed DACs and ADCs, and connected it to a custom-designed analog front-end for signal conditioning.</p>

<p>We compare the performance of the flat-sky approximation and Limber approximation for the clustering analysis of the photometric galaxy catalogue of Euclid. We study a 6 bin configuration representing the first data release (DR1) and a 13 bin configuration representative of the third and final data release (DR3). We find that the Limber approximation is sufficiently accurate for the analysis of the wide bins of DR1. Contrarily, the 13 bins of DR3 cannot be modelled accurately with the Limber approximation. Instead, the flat-sky approximation is accurate to below $5\%$ in recovering the angular power spectra of galaxy number counts in both cases and can be used to simplify the computation of the full power spectrum in harmonic space for the data analysis of DR3.</p>

<p>We present a complete one-loop analysis of charged scalar boson pair production in photon-photon collisions, $\gamma\gamma \to H^\pm H^\mp$, within the framework of the Inert Doublet Model (IDM). The calculation is carried out in the on-shell renormalization scheme and incorporates both weak corrections and QED effects, including soft and hard photon radiation. Virtual loop contributions and real emission processes are computed using the Feynman diagrammatic method, ensuring the cancellation of ultraviolet and infrared divergences. To properly account for the Coulomb singularity that arises in the QED sector near threshold, we introduce the resummed cross section based on the Sommerfeld factor. The IDM parameter space is explored under theoretical consistency conditions, collider limits, and dark matter constraints, and three representative scenarios are studied in detail. We find that the magnitude of the quantum corrections is strongly controlled by the absolute value of the trilinear scalar coupling $\lambda_{h^0 H^+ H^-}$, which correlates with the charged scalar mass. When all constraints are applied, the weak corrections are typically in the range of $-12\%$ to $-7\%$ at $\sqrt{s}=250$~GeV, and between $-15\%$ and $6\%$ at $\sqrt{s}=500$~GeV. At higher energies, such as $\sqrt{s}=1$~TeV, the corrections can become very large, ranging from about $-20\%$ up to $+60\%$. Our findings highlight the significant role of higher-order effects in photon-photon collisions and establish $\gamma\gamma \to H^\pm H^\mp$ as a promising process to investigate the charged scalar sector of the IDM at future high-energy photon colliders. Several benchmark points are proposed to facilitate future experimental searches.</p>

<p>Due to wave interference, an ultralight light dark matter halo has stochastic, granular substructures which can scatter stars, leading to the heating of stellar distributions. Studies of this phenomenon have placed lower bounds on the ultralight dark matter mass. In this paper we investigate a number of relevant systematic effects, including: (1) the heating by the central soliton, (2) the self-gravity of the stars, (3) the suppression of heating in a tidally stripped halo, and (4) the tidal field suppression of heating when the stellar cluster is much smaller than the de Broglie wavelength. The first three effects are quantified by studying the dynamics of stellar particles in Schrodinger-Poisson simulations of ultralight dark matter halos, while the last effect is studied using analytic approximations.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>AT2025ulz and S250818k: zooming in with the Hubble Space Telescope</strong>, Yu-Han Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18854v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18854v1</a></p>

<p>AT2025ulz is an optical/near-infrared transient discovered during follow-up of the candidate gravitational wave (GW) event S250818k. Its young age ($\lesssim$1 d), rapid decline and strong color evolution over the first 48 hr classify it as a potential kilonova candidate. In this work, we present the results of our observing campaign, carried out with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Although the early time evolution of AT2025ulz resembles some aspects of a kilonova, its rapid onset ($\sim$3 hr after the GW trigger) and luminosity (a factor of $\sim5$ brighter than AT2017gfo in $g$-band) are difficult to reproduce. Only a small subset of our kilonova models matches its multi-color light curve, and the inferred ejecta mass is uncomfortably large given the low chirp mass ($\lesssim!0.87!$ M$_{\odot}$) of the GW candidate. HST observations place the transient within a nearby ($z=0.08489$) spiral galaxy with on-going star-formation and measure a color ($F336W-F160W!\approx!1.4$ mag) that is too blue to match with a kilonova. Our data support the classification of AT2025ulz as a supernova, initially undergoing a shock-cooling phase and later entering its photospheric phase, and spectroscopically identified via its broad absorption features.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>The role of the secondary white dwarf in a double-degenerate double-detonation explosion, in the supernova remnant phase</strong>, Gilles Ferrand et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18800v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18800v1</a></p>

<p>Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are believed to be thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf (WD) stars, but their progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms are still unclear. Here we focus on double degenerate systems, where two WDs are interacting, and on the double detonation mechanism, where a detonation of a helium shell triggers a detonation of the carbon-oxygen core of the primary WD. We take the results from three-dimensional SN simulations of Pakmor et al 2022 (arXiv:2203.14990) and carry them into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, until 1500 yr after the explosion. We reveal signatures of the SN imprinted in the SNR morphology. We confirm the impact of a companion on the SNR: its presence induces a conical shadow in the ejecta, that is long lived. Its intersection with the shocked shell is visible in projection as a ring, an ellipse, or a bar, depending on the orientation. New, we test the case of a nested explosion model, in which the explosion of the primary induces the secondary to also explode. As the explosion of the secondary WD is weaker only the primary outer ejecta interact with the ambient medium and form the main SNR shell. The secondary inner ejecta collide with the reverse shock, which enhances the density and thus the X-ray emissivity. The composition at the points of impact is peculiar, since what is revealed are the outer layers from the inner ejecta. This effect can be probed with spatially-resolved X-ray spectroscopy of young SNRs.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Multiple shells in supernova 2023ixf support the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM)</strong>, Noam Soker et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18782v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18782v1</a></p>

<p>Examining the photospheric time evolution of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 2023ixf from the literature, we identify three evolutionary time periods with constant expansion velocities, which we attribute to three ejecta shells. We find that several CCSN remnants have morphologies with two or more complete or partial shells, compatible with the presence of two or three photospheric shells during the photospheric phase of the explosion. Studies have attributed these CCSN remnants to the jittering-jet explosion mechanism (JJEM), which involves two or three energetic pairs of jets participating in the explosion. We, therefore, conclude that the structure of the photospheric shells of SN 2023ixf supports its explosion by the JJEM. This study adds to the accumulating evidence that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNE.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Particle acceleration at radiative supernova remnant shocks</strong>, Pierre Cristofari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18763v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18763v1</a></p>

<p>Numerous astrophysical shock waves evolve in an environment where the radiative cooling behind the shock affects the hydrodynamical structure downstream, thereby influencing the potential for particle acceleration via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA).   We study the possibility for DSA to energize particles from the thermal pool and from pre-existing cosmic rays at radiative shocks, focusing on the case of supernova remnants (SNRs). We rely on a semi-analytical description of particle acceleration at collisionless shocks in the test-particle limit, estimating the total proton and electron content from SNRs throughout the radiative phase. Our results indicate that DSA can lead to significant particle acceleration during the first few tens of kyrs of the radiative phase. Although the associated multi-wavelength emission from SNRs in the radiative phase may not be detectable with current observatories in most cases, the radiative phase is found to lead to substantial deviations from the canonical p$^{-4}$ of the test-particle limit. The hardening/steepening is due to an interplay between a growing contribution of the reaccelerated term as the SNR volume expands and the effects of adiabatic and radiative losses on trapped particles as particles are confined for a longer time. The slope of the cumulative proton and electron spectra over the SNR lifetime thus depends on the environment in which the SNR shock propagates, and on the duration of the radiative phase during which DSA can take place. Overall, DSA in the radiative phase can lead to a total electron spectrum steeper than the proton spectrum, both at SNRs from thermonuclear and core-collapse SNe. Finally, we comment on the case of young radiative SNRs (in the first month to a few years after the explosion) for which the denser environments (with mass-loss rates of $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-1} - 1$ M$_{\odot}$/yr) tend to inhibit DSA.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Probing cosmology with bright sirens from the CosmoDC2_BCO LSST synthetic catalog</strong>, Ranier Menote et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18752v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18752v1</a></p>

<p>Bright sirens, i.e. gravitational-wave detections of compact binary mergers with electromagnetic counterparts, provide a self-calibrated distance-redshift relation and are therefore powerful probes of cosmic expansion. Using the CosmoDC2_BCO catalog, we forecast cosmological constraints from current (LVK) and next-generation (ET, CE) detector networks, in combination with a Roman-like Type Ia supernova sample. We find that third-generation networks reach sub-percent precision on the Hubble constant within a few years, achieving 0.2% after a decade with CE+ET+LVK, while LVK remains limited to the 6% level. The LVK fifth observing run may shed light on the H_0 tension only if the inferred value falls outside the range spanned by the Planck and SH0ES determinations, which currently achieve far higher precisions. Supernovae do not directly tighten H_0 but stabilize its inference through parameter correlations and enable an absolute calibration of the supernova magnitude M_B. In dynamical dark-energy models, the joint analysis of Roman supernovae and bright sirens yields a Figure of Merit of 25 for ET+LVK and 76 for CE+ET+LVK, to be compared with the state-of-the-art DESI DR2 BAO plus DESY5 supernovae value of 56. Sky-localization thresholds of DeltaOmega &lt; 50 deg^2, or even DeltaOmega &lt; 10 deg^2, entail only mild penalties, suggesting efficient follow-up strategies. These results establish third-generation GW+EM observations, especially when combined with Roman supernovae, as a cornerstone for precision cosmology in the next decade.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Binding energy of compact stars and their non-radial oscillations</strong>, P. Laskos-Patkos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18706v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18706v1</a></p>

<p>In the past years, a significant effort has been made with the scope of determining correlations, involving compact star properties, that are independent of the nuclear equation of state. Such universal relations are of utmost importance as they allow for the imposition of constraints on stellar properties without directly measuring them and they may also serve as a probe of General Relativity. In the present study, we investigated the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy of compact stars and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations. The main motivation was related to the fact that both of the aforementioned quantities might be measured in the occurrence of a supernova explosion. Interestingly, we found that there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the binding energy for both $f$ and $p_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter. The inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase transitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned quasi-universal relation.</p>

<p>2025-10-21, <strong>Unveiling the nature of HE 0107-5240</strong>, E. Caffau et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18498v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.18498v1</a></p>

<p>The vast majority of the most iron-poor stars in the Galaxy exhibit a strong carbon enhancement, with C/H ratios only about two orders of magnitude below solar. This unusual chemical composition likely reflects the properties of the gas cloud from which these stars formed, having been enriched by one, or at most a few, supernovae. A remarkable member of this stellar class, HE 0107-5240 with [Fe/H]=-5.56, has been identified as part of a binary system. To constrain its orbital parameters, radial velocity monitoring has been carried out using the ESPRESSO spectrograph. Radial velocities were derived using cross-correlation with a template, taking advantage of the strong G-band feature. Combining all observations yielded a high signal-to-noise spectrum, which has been used to refine our understanding of the stellar chemical composition. Additionally, a co-added UVES spectrum in the blue was used to complement the wavelength coverage of ESPRESSO. Observations of HE 0107-5240 over a span of more than four years have yielded a revised orbital period of about 29 years. Updated elemental abundances have been determined for Sc, Cr, Co, and, tentatively, Al, along with a new upper limit for Be. The iron abundance has been derived from ionised Fe lines. Significant upper limits have been established for Li, Si, and Sr. The star is confirmed to be a long-period binary. Iron abundances derived from neutral and ionised lines are consistent with local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) assumption, casting doubt on published deviation from LTE corrections for Fe for this star. The heavy elements Sr and Ba remain undetected, confirming the classification of HE 0107-5240 as a carbon enhanced metal-poor and non enhanced in heavy elements (CEMP-no) star and supporting the absence of an n-capture element plateau at the lowest metallicities.</p>

<p>After the third LIGOâVirgoâKAGRA observing run, the number of detected binary black hole (BBH) mergers became sufficient to identify statistical features of the population. We explore how different prescriptions for the final fate of massive stars and key binary-evolution processes shape isolated binaries and their remnants. Using \textsc{sevn}, we evolved $10^{7}$ binaries across 15 metallicities, 3 core-collapse supernova models, 4 PPISN models, and 6 common-envelope (CE) prescriptions, for a total of 990 runs ($9.9 \times 10^{9}$ systems). Both single- and binary-star physics shape the BH mass distribution: single-star processes control the high-mass tail ($M_{\rm BH} \geq 45M_{\odot}$), while binary evolution produces pile-ups in specific intervals. In particular, the bump at $\sim 35 M_{\odot}$, often attributed to PPISNe, also emerges from binaries evolving only through stable mass transfer, without CE. Finally, we test a top-heavy IMF, finding it boosts merger numbers and alters the abundance of systems with a given primary BH mass.</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>A modeling perspective on the diversity of red-supergiant stars exploding within circumstellar material</strong>, Luc Dessart et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17676v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.17676v1</a></p>

<p>With the ever faster cadence of untargeted surveys of the sky, the supernova (SN) community will capture in the coming years a growing number of shock breakouts in red-supergiant (RSG) stars. Expecting a high frequency of breakouts within circumstellar material (CSM), we have produced an extended, regular and cubic grid of models covering from low- to high-energy explosions, compact to extended CSM, moderate- to high-density CSM. Here, we document the main results from the radiation-hydrodynamics and nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative-transfer calculations over the first 15d of evolution, including the bolometric and multi-band light curves and the salient features from spectra. As before, CSM interaction is found to boost the UV brightness and shorten the optical rise time if compact. Higher ionization (e.g., as seen with OVI3820A) is obtained for more compact CSM, and is maximum for explosions in a vacuum. CSM interaction also diversifies the spectral evolution as seen in line profile morphology, with electron-scattering broadening dominating during the IIn phase. In the absence of CSM, Doppler broadening dominates immediately after shock breakout and leads to strongly blueshifted emission in lines such as HeII4686A or CIV5805A. This treasury of models will be used to analyze as well as predict future observations of RSG shock breakouts in CSM.</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>From Stars to Waves: Non-deterministic Inference of Microlensed Gravitational Waves</strong>, Zhaoqi Su et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17125v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.17125v1</a></p>

<p>Strongly lensed gravitational waves may pass through the stellar field of a lensing galaxy with additional modulations (on both phase and amplitude) due to gravitational microlensing effect of stars/remnants near the line of sight. These microlensed waveforms depend on the mass and location of thousands or more most relevant stars, so that their deterministic reconstruction from the data is computationally prohibitive. We classify the detection and parameter estimation of such events as non-deterministic inference problem and propose a solution with the implementation of normalizing flows. As a first step, we show that $8\%$ of microlensed events can be detected with significance $\ge 3 \sigma$ in the third generation era, with the chosen microlensing parameters correlated with the density of the underlying stellar field. This approach opens the door to probing microlensing effects and the properties of the underlying stellar fields. A similar construction may also be applied to other non-deterministic inference problems, such as detecting post-merger gravitational waves from binary neutron star coalescence and signals from core-collapse supernovae.</p>

<p>2025-10-20, <strong>Optimizing Kilonova Searches: A Case Study of the Type IIb SN 2025ulz in the Localization Volume of the Low-Significance Gravitational Wave Event S250818k</strong>, Noah Franz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17104v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.17104v1</a></p>

<p>Kilonovae, the ultraviolet/optical/infrared counterparts to binary neutron star mergers, are an exceptionally rare class of transients. Optical follow-up campaigns are plagued by impostors whose early evolution masquerades as the rapid radioactive decay of heavy elements. In this work, we present an analysis of the multi-wavelength dataset of supernova (SN) 2025ulz, a proposed kilonova candidate following the low-significance detection of gravitational waves originating from the potential binary neutron star merger S250818k. Despite an early rapid decline in brightness, our multi-wavelength observations of SN 2025ulz reveal that it is a type IIb supernova. As part of this analysis, we demonstrate the capabilities of a novel quantitative scoring algorithm to determine the likelihood that a transient candidate is a kilonova, based primarily on its 3D location and light curve evolution. We also apply our scoring algorithm to other transient candidates in the localization volume of S250818k and find that, at all times after the discovery of SN 2025ulz, there are $\geq 4$ candidates with a score more promising than SN 2025ulz. During future kilonova searches, this type of scoring algorithm will be useful to rule out contaminating transients in real time, optimizing the use of valuable telescope resources.</p>
