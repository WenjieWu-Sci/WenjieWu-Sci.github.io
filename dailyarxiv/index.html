<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Gas Electroluminescence in a Dual Phase Xenon-Doped Argon Detector</strong>, James W. Kingston et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02261v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.02261v1</a></p>

<p>Noble element detectors using argon or xenon as the detection medium are widely used in the searches for rare neutrino and dark matter interactions. Xenon doping in liquid argon can preserve attractive properties of an argon target while enhancing the detectable signals with properties of xenon. In this work, we deployed a dual-phase liquid argon detector with up to 4% xenon doping in the liquid and studied its gas electroluminescence properties as a function of xenon concentration. At $\sim$2% xenon doping in liquid argon, we measured $\sim$34 ppm of xenon in the gas and observed $\sim$2.5 times larger electroluminescence signals in the detector than those in pure argon. By analyzing signals recorded by photosensors of different wavelength sensitivities, we confirm that the argon gas electroluminescence process is strongly affected by the addition of xenon. We propose an analytical model to describe the underlying energy transfer mechanism in argon-xenon gas mixtures. Lastly, the implications of this measurement for low energy ionization signal detection will be discussed.</p>

<p>Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers (TPCs) are widely used in searches for rare dark matter and neutrino interactions, in part because of their excellent position reconstruction capability in 3D. Despite their millimeter-scale resolution along the charge drift axis, xenon TPCs face challenges in resolving single-site (SS) and multi-site (MS) interactions in the transverse plane. In this paper, we build a generic TPC model with an idealized light-based signal readout, and use Fisher Information (FI) to study its theoretical capability of differentiating SS and MS events. We also demonstrate via simulation that this limit can be approached with conventional reconstruction algorithms like maximum likelihood estimation, and with a convolutional neural network classifier. The implications of this study on future TPC experiments will be discussed.</p>

<p>The existence of a large primordial neutrino asymmetry is an intriguing possibility, both observationally and theoretically. Such an asymmetry can lead to the resonant production of $\mathrm{keV}$-scale sterile neutrinos, which are a fascinating candidate for dark matter. In this paper, we comprehensively revisit the resonant production processes with a refined numerical analysis, adopting a dynamical discretization of momentum modes to take care of the sharpness of the resonance. We find parameter regions consistent with X-ray and Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints for lepton-to-entropy ratio $\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ and $m_{\nu_s}\gtrsim 20$\,keV. We also explore the Affleck-Dine mechanism as a possible origin for such asymmetries. While previous studies considered resonant production after lepton number generation, we numerically investigate cases where a fraction of sterile neutrinos is produced during lepton number injection. In this regime, some parameter sets can shorten the free-streaming length and reduce the required mixing angle to match the observed dark matter abundance, thereby mitigating the observational constraints.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Reducing Simulation Dependence in Neutrino Telescopes with Masked Point Transformers</strong>, Felix J. Yu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01733v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01733v1</a></p>

<p>Machine learning techniques in neutrino physics have traditionally relied on simulated data, which provides access to ground-truth labels. However, the accuracy of these simulations and the discrepancies between simulated and real data remain significant concerns, particularly for large-scale neutrino telescopes that operate in complex natural media. In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for reducing dependence on labeled datasets. Here, we present the first self-supervised training pipeline for neutrino telescopes, leveraging point cloud transformers and masked autoencoders. By shifting the majority of training to real data, this approach minimizes reliance on simulations, thereby mitigating associated systematic uncertainties. This represents a fundamental departure from previous machine learning applications in neutrino telescopes, paving the way for substantial improvements in event reconstruction and classification.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>GUT-motivated non-invertible symmetry as a solution to the strong CP problem and the neutrino CP-violating phase</strong>, Tatsuo Kobayashi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01680v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01680v1</a></p>

<p>The unsuppressed CP violation in QCD is a problem in the standard model. If we have some mechanism to guarantee real determinants of the quark mass matrices, the vanishing physical vacuum angle $\bar \theta$ indicates the CP invariance at the fundamental level. Thus, the small ${\bar \theta}$ is technically natural, since we have an enhanced CP symmetry in the limit of the vanishing $\bar \theta =0$. In fact, it was proved that the vacuum angle is never renormalized up to the four-loop level once it is fixed at 0 value at some high energy scale. The purpose of this paper is to construct a model which guarantees the real determinants of the quark mass matrices assuming a non-invertible symmetry.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Dedicated-frequency analysis of gravitational-wave bursts from core-collapse supernovae with minimal assumptions</strong>, Yi Shuen C. Lee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01614v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01614v1</a></p>

<p>Gravitational-wave (GW) emissions from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) provide insights into the internal processes leading up to their explosions. Theory predicts that CCSN explosions are driven by hydrodynamical instabilities like the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or neutrino-driven convection, and simulations show that these mechanisms emit GWs at low frequencies ($\lesssim 0.25 \,{\rm kHz}$). Thus the detection of low-frequency GWs, or lack thereof, is useful for constraining explosion mechanisms in CCSNe. This paper introduces the dedicated-frequency framework, which is designed to follow-up GW burst detections using bandpass analyses. The primary aim is to study whether low-frequency (LF) follow-up analyses, limited to $\leq 256 \,{\rm Hz}$, constrain CCSN explosion models in practical observing scenarios. The analysis dataset comprises waveforms from five CCSN models with different strengths of low-frequency GW emissions induced by SASI and/or neutrino-driven convection, injected into the Advanced LIGO data from the Third Observing Run (O3). Eligible candidates for the LF follow-up must satisfy a benchmark detection significance and are identified using the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) algorithm. The LF follow-up analyses are performed using the BayesWave algorithm. Both cWB and BayesWave make minimal assumptions about the signal’s morphology. The results suggest that the successful detection of a CCSN in the LF follow-up analysis constrains its explosion mechanism. The dedicated-frequency framework also has other applications. As a demonstration, the loudest trigger from the SN 2019fcn supernova search is followed-up using a high-frequency (HF) analysis, limited to $\geq 256 \,{\rm Hz}$. The trigger has negligible power below $256 \, {\rm Hz}$, and the HF analysis successfully enhances its detection significance.</p>

<p>2025-10-01, <strong>Cosmological Constraints on Secluded Dark Radiation</strong>, Jae Hyeok Chang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01309v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01309v1</a></p>

<p>Dark radiation (DR) is ubiquitous in physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), and its interactions with the SM and dark matter (DM) lead to a variety of interesting effects on cosmological observables. However, even in scenarios where DR is ‘secluded’, i.e., only gravitationally interacting with SM and DM, it can leave discernible signatures. We present a comprehensive study of four different types of DR: free-streaming, self-interacting (coupled), decoupling, and recoupling DR, and vary initial conditions to include both adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations. In addition to these properties, we also vary neutrino energy density, DR energy density, and the SM neutrino masses to perform a general analysis and study degeneracies among neutrino and DR properties. We derive constraints using the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, and supernova datasets. We find no significant preference for physics beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model, but data exhibit interesting interplays between different physical quantities. When the neutrino energy density is allowed to vary, we find that the cosmological dataset prefers massless free-streaming DR over massive neutrinos, leading to a significant relaxation of the neutrino mass bound. Although we do not find any evidence of DR isocurvature, the data show support for a strong blue tilt of the isocurvature power spectrum. Our analysis also highlights the degeneracy of various DR parameters with the Hubble constant $H_0$ resulting in a mild relaxation of the $H_0$ tension.</p>

<p>2025-10-01, <strong>Vanishing Acts: Quantifying Black Hole Formation with the DSNB Signal</strong>, Tim Charissé et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01177v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01177v1</a></p>

<p>The diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) created by stellar core-collapses throughout cosmic history is on the verge of discovery, with SK-Gd showing early deviations from the background expectation and JUNO starting to take data. However, the interpretation of early DSNB data will face significant challenges due to degeneracies between astrophysical parameters and uncertainties in supernova neutrino modeling. We explore how complementary astronomical observations can break these degeneracies and, in this context, we investigate whether early DSNB observations can constrain invisible supernovae, which have no optical emission but are powerful neutrino sources before being swallowed by a forming black hole. Leveraging the differences in the spectra between invisible and visible supernovae, we estimate the sensitivity of 1) detecting the existence of invisible supernovae, and 2) determining the fraction of invisible supernovae. Finally, we discuss how these conclusions depend on the spectral parameters of the black hole-forming component.</p>

<p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the universe, offering insights into stellar collapse, extreme matter behavior, and cosmic evolution. The advent of multi-messenger astronomy, combining electromagnetic, gravitational wave, and neutrino observations, alongside advances in high-energy polarimetry, is revolutionizing GRB research, enabling deeper exploration of their physical mechanisms.   This manuscript summarizes how upcoming and proposed space-based missions will tackle key challenges in GRB science, focusing on four areas: (i) identifying high-redshift GRBs to probe the early universe, (ii) enhancing multi-messenger detection and localization, (iii) improving multi-wavelength follow-up of GRB afterglows, and (iv) studying prompt emission polarization to understand jet dynamics and magnetic fields. Highlighting planned missions and their advancements, this work provides a snapshot of current GRB research frontiers, with updates on the evolving status of these missions.</p>

<p>2025-10-01, <strong>Mass Varying Neutrino Oscillation in Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</strong>, H. Mohseni Sadjad et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00704v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.00704v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate how matter density affects neutrino oscillations by considering a mass-varying neutrino scenario where the neutrino mass depends on a scalar field. This scalar field is non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant, causing its profile to be implicitly influenced by the surrounding matter distribution. Using data from solar neutrino experiments, we derive constraints on the model parameters, providing new insights into the properties of mass-varying neutrino within the Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor framework</p>

<p>2025-10-01, <strong>Diffuse neutrino flux from coronal magnetospheric current sheets of accreting black holes</strong>, Despina Karavola et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00648v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.00648v1</a></p>

<p>Non-jetted AGN exhibit hard X-ray emission with a power law spectrum above $\sim$2 keV, which is thought to be produced through Comptonization of soft photons by electrons and positrons (pairs) in the vicinity of the black hole. The origin and composition of this plasma source, known as the corona, is a matter open for debate. Our study focuses on the role of relativistic protons accelerated in black-hole magnetospheric current sheets in the neutrino production of AGN coronae. We present a model that has two free parameters, namely the proton plasma magnetization $\sigma_{\rm p}$, which controls the peak energy of the neutrino spectrum, and the Eddington ratio $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ (defined as the ratio between X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and Eddington luminosity $L_{\rm Edd}$), which controls the amount of energy transferred to secondary particles. Furthermore, we combine our coronal model with an AGN population in order to provide a prediction for the diffuse neutrino flux measured on Earth. We compare our results with the observational data by IceCube and we find a satisfactory agreement on both the flux value and the slope of the neutrino distribution when we assume a $\sigma_{\rm p}$ value of $10^5$ for all the sources in our sample.</p>

<p>2025-10-01, <strong>Fabrication and characterization of AlMn alloy superconducting films for 0vbb experiments</strong>, Zhouhui Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00641v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.00641v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinoless double-beta decay (0vbb) experiments constitute a pivotal probe for elucidating the characteristics of neutrinos and further discovering new physics. Compared to the neutron transmutation doped germanium thermistors (NTD-Ge) used in 0vbb experiments such as CUORE, transition edge sensors (TES) theoretically have a relatively faster response time and higher energy resolution. These make TES detectors good choice for next generation 0vbb experiments. In this paper, AlMn alloy superconducting films, the main components of TES, were prepared and studied. The relationship between critical temperature (Tc) and annealing temperature was established, and the impact of magnetic field on Tc was tested. The experimental results demonstrate that the Tc of AlMn film can be tuned in the required range of 10 - 20 mK by using the above methods, which is a key step for the application of AlMn TES in 0vbb experiment. In the test range, the Tc of AlMn film is sensitive to out-of-plane magnetic field but not to the in-plane magnetic field. Furthermore, we find that a higher annealing temperature results in a more uniform distribution of Mn ions in depth, which opens a new avenue for elucidating the underlying mechanism for tuning Tc.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Astrophysical Consequences of an Electroweak $\etaw$ Pseudo-Scalar</strong>, Hooman Davoudiasl et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02310v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.02310v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, it has been suggested that the spectrum of physical states in the Standard Model may include an ultralight pseudo-scalar, denoted by $\eta_w$, in analogy with the $\eta’$ state arising from the strong interactions. We find that typical expectations for the properties of $\eta_w$ get challenged by astrophysical constraints on the couplings of ultralight bosons. Our strongest limit sets a lower bound of O(1000 TeV) on the decay constant of the hypothesized pseudo-scalar. We also briefly discuss whether $\eta_w$ could be a dark matter candidate, or the origin of dark energy, but conclude that those identifications appear unlikely. Given the important implications of a potentially overlooked $\eta_w$ state for a more complete understanding of the electroweak interactions and a fundamental description of Nature, further theoretical and phenomenological investigations of this possibility and its associated physics are warranted.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Measurement of Dark Matter Substructure from the Kinematics of the GD-1 Stellar Stream</strong>, Jacob Nibauer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02247v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.02247v1</a></p>

<p>Stellar streams are sensitive tracers of low-mass dark matter subhalos and provide a means to test the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm on small scales. In this work, we connect the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the GD-1 stream to the number density and internal structure of dark matter subhalos in the mass range $10^5$-$10^9\ M_\odot$. We measure the radial velocity dispersion of GD-1 based on 160 identified member stars across four different spectroscopic catalogs. We use repeat observations of the same stars to constrain binarity. We find that the stream’s intrinsic radial velocity dispersion ranges from approximately 2-5 km/s across its length. The region of GD-1 with the highest velocity dispersion represents a $4\sigma$ deviation from unperturbed stream models formed in a smooth Milky Way potential, which are substantially colder. We use perturbation theory to model the stream’s velocity dispersion as a function of dark matter subhalo population parameters, including the number of low-mass subhalos in the Milky Way, the dark matter half-mode mass, and the mass-concentration relation of subhalos. We find that the observed velocity dispersion can be explained by numerous impacts with low-mass dark matter subhalos, or by a single impact with a very compact subhalo with $M \gtrsim 10^8\ M_\odot$. Our constraint on the fraction of mass in subhalos is $f_{\mathrm{sub}} = 0.05^{+0.08}_{-0.03}$ (68\% confidence). In both scenarios, our model prefers subhalos that are more compact compared to CDM mass-size expectations. These results suggest a possible deviation from CDM at low subhalo masses, which may be accounted for by dark matter self-interactions that predict higher concentrations in lower-mass subhalos.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Wasserstein normalized autoencoder for anomaly detection</strong>, CMS Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02168v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.02168v1</a></p>

<p>A novel anomaly detection algorithm is presented. The Wasserstein normalized autoencoder (WNAE) is a normalized probabilistic model that minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the learned probability distribution – a Boltzmann distribution where the energy is the reconstruction error of the autoencoder – and the distribution of the training data. This algorithm has been developed and applied to the identification of semivisible jets – conical sprays of visible standard model particles and invisible dark matter states – with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. Trained on jets of particles from simulated standard model processes, the WNAE is shown to learn the probability distribution of the input data in a fully unsupervised fashion, such that it effectively identifies new physics jets as anomalies. The model consistently demonstrates stable, convergent training and achieves strong classification performance across a wide range of signals, improving upon standard normalized autoencoders, while remaining agnostic to the signal. The WNAE directly tackles the problem of outlier reconstruction, a common failure mode of autoencoders in anomaly detection tasks.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>In-situ globular clusters in alternative dark matter Milky Way galaxies: a first approach to fuzzy and core-like dark matter theories</strong>, Pierre Boldrini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02130v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.02130v1</a></p>

<p>We present a first analysis of the dynamics of in-situ globular clusters (GCs) in Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies embedded in fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos, combining cosmological assembly histories from the TNG50 simulation with dedicated orbital integrations and analytical models. GC populations are initialized with identical distributions in normalized $E$-$L_{z}$ in matched CDM and FDM halos. In a universe dominated by FDM, we identify three distinct regimes for the in-situ GC population depending on the particle mass $m_{22} \equiv m_{\chi}/ 10^{-22}~\mathrm{eV}$. For $m_{22} &lt; 7$, baryons dominate the inner potential, which remains steep and centrally concentrated, confining GC orbits to a narrow region and producing less massive, more compact systems than in CDM. For $m_{22} \sim 7$, GC properties resemble those in CDM, with similar mass and spatial distributions. For $m_{22} &gt; 7$, the dark matter becomes both compact and globally dominant, generating a deeper and more extended gravitational potential that supports a wider range of stable GC orbits, resulting in more massive and spatially extended GC systems. Finally, we extend our framework to make predictions for GC populations in alternative DM models, including warm dark matter and self-interacting dark matter, in both MW-like and dwarf galaxies. Our findings demonstrate that in-situ GC systems offer a sensitive and independent probe of the underlying DM physics, opening new avenues for observational constraints with upcoming Euclid.</p>

<p>We present results of the search for WIMP-like dark matter interaction with electrons in the NaI(Tl) crystals of the COSINE-100 experiment. The two benchmark scenarios of a heavy and a light vector boson as mediator of the interaction were studied. We found no excess events over the expected background in a data-set of 2.82 yr, with a total exposure of 172.9 kg.yr. The derived 90% confidence level upper limits exclude a WIMP-electron scattering cross section above 6.4 $\times$ 10$^{-33}$ cm$^2$ for a WIMP mass of 0.25 GeV, assuming a light mediator; and above 3.4 $\times$ 10$^{-37}$ cm$^2$ for a 0.4 GeV WIMP, assuming a heavy mediator, and represent the most stringent constraints for a NaI(Tl) target to date. We also briefly discuss a planned analysis using an annual modulation method below the current 0.7 keV threshold of COSINE-100, down to few photoelectrons yield.</p>

<p>We report the electrical (dark) characterization of lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs) fabricated from a Titanium/Aluminum bilayer and designed for broadband absorption in the W-band (75-110 GHz). These detectors are prototypes for future QCD axion search experiments within the Canfranc Axion Detection Experiment (CADEx), which demand sub 1e-19 W/Hz^0.5 sensitivities under low optical backgrounds. We combine a Mattis-Bardeen analysis to the temperature dependence of the detector parameters with noise spectroscopy to determine the electrical noise equivalent power (NEP). The minimum measured value for the electrical NEP is 3e-19 W/Hz0.5. Across the measured temperature range, we find that quasiparticle lifetime deviates from the expected BCS recombination law. Our analysis suggests that non-equilibrium relaxation is governed by spatial inhomogeneities in the superconducting gap and phonon diffusion effects. This work sets the road-map to achieve suitable and ultra-sensitive detectors in the W-band for dark matter axion search experiments.</p>

<p>We show that measuring dark matter signal by projecting quantum sensors in the collective excited state can highly suppress the non-collective noise background, hence improving the sensitivity significantly. We trace the evolution of the sensors’ state in the presence of both dark matter effect and sensors’ decoherence effects, optimizing the protocol execution time, and show that the suppression of background by a factor equal to the number of sensors is possible. This method does not require the entanglement of sensors during the signal accumulation time, hence circumventing the difficulty of maintaining the lifetime of the entangled state that is present in other enhancement proposals. This protocol is also general regarding the type of qubit sensors.</p>

<p>Astrophysical and cosmological evidence strongly supports the existence of Dark Matter (DM), yet no candidate particle is predicted by the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. Among the most studied and hypotheses are Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMPs), which could account for the observed relic DM density through weak interactions in the early Universe. Direct detection experiments aim to observe low-energy nuclear recoils induced by DM interactions, requiring detectors with very low background levels and high sensitivity. The CYGNO project develops large gaseous Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) for directional DM searches. Using a helium- and fluorine-rich gas mixture, a triple GEM amplification system and optical readout via PMTs and scientific CMOS cameras, CYGNO enables 3D track reconstruction and sensitivity to both Spin-Independent and Spin-Dependent interactions. Several prototypes have been built, culminating in the Long Imaging ModulE (LIME), a 50 L active volume TPC. Installed underground at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in 2022. LIME represents a milestone toward a full-scale directional DM detector. This thesis reports on the calibration and stability studies of LIME, presenting methods to control environmental effects on detector performance, a novel data equalisation technique and first sensitivity studies for DM detection. The results contribute to validating CYGNO’s approach and advancing the roadmap toward large-scale directional Dark Matter searches.</p>

<p>Motivated by recent detections of low-mass perturbers in strong gravitational lensing systems, we investigate analogs of these objects in the Concerto suite, a set of cosmological N-body zoom-in simulations of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with high-amplitude, velocity-dependent cross sections. We investigate characteristic halo properties relevant to gravitational imaging measurements, focusing on the projected enclosed mass and the central density slope. In SIDM, these quantities evolve continuously through gravothermal processes, spanning core-expansion and core-collapse phases, in sharp contrast to cold dark matter, where they remain nearly static after halo formation. This SIDM evolution further depends on tidal environment and merger history, which can be probed through strong lensing. We also identify simulated SIDM halos whose properties are consistent with the properties of low-mass perturbers inferred from recent observations, and we demonstrate that the core-collapse mechanism offers a compelling explanation for their observed high densities. Our results highlight the potential of strong gravitational lensing as a powerful probe of dark matter self-interactions.</p>

<p>The SPLENDOR Collaboration studies novel narrow-gap semiconductors and engineered a substrate agnostic detector platform to achieve $\mathcal{O}$(meV) energy sensitivity designed for low mass dark matter searches. This was achieved using low-capacitance and low-noise commercial CryoHEMTs in a split-stage topology integrated throughout a dilution refrigerator. Designed with a source-follower HEMT at the base temperature stage and a voltage amplifier at 4\,K, this amplifier has input-limited voltage noise of 10 $\text{nV}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ and current noise of 100 $\text{aA}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at 1kHz. In agreement with this noise level and a photon calibration, this amplifier has a $\text{19} \pm \text{4} $ electron resolution.</p>

<p>We present the discovery and characterisation of two Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (LANs), RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat, as satellite structures of two giant LANs at $z=2.920$ and 3.092. They are found neighbouring two out of four known giant LANs at $z\sim3$ in our MUSE follow-up observations, reinforcing the idea that Ly$\alpha$ emission can be used to trace massive dark matter halos at high-$z$. This high occurrence of massive satellite halos agrees with simulations. With sizes of $\simeq80\times160$ and $80\times100~\mathrm{pkpc}^2$, the two nebulae are both $\sim$300pkpc from the main LANs. The Ly$\alpha$ emission is only shifted by $\simeq100-300$ km s$^{-1}$ between each of the two pairs, suggesting connections via large-scale structure. RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat are estimated to have log$(M_\mathrm{h}/M_\odot)\simeq13.2\pm0.3$ and $12.8\pm0.3$, putting them potentially close to the regime of cold-mode accretion. The central brightest galaxies in the two halos are morphologically distinct despite having similar stellar mass $\sim10^{11}M_\odot$, one being an elliptical quiescent galaxy in RO-1001-Sat and the other being a dusty star-forming spiral in RO-0959-Sat. Intriguingly, the quiescent galaxy aligns well with the peak of the LAN as well as the potential well of the host halo, making it the first clear-cut case where the cold gas ought to be accreting onto the galaxy but with no observable star formation, either due to morphological quenching or, more likely, radio-mode feedback from an active galactic nucleus. Finally, we show a tentative detection of a Ly$\alpha$ filament connecting RO-1001 and RO-1001-Sat. This work shows how panoramic MUSE (and in the future, BlueMUSE) observations of massive halo seeds can be used to efficiently search for additional halos, unveiling their large-scale structure and enabling the study of Ly$\alpha$-selected galaxy groups.</p>

<p>We analyze the effect of Dark Matter (DM) - Standard Model (SM) non-gravitational interactions on the orbital dynamics of celestial bodies near the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, where the DM density is generically expected to be high. We outline the conditions under which a DM-SM scattering channel gives rise to a drag force on objects in this region, and show that for sufficiently large cross-sections, this effect can lead to observable orbital decay on timescales as short as a single orbital period. We identify the types of objects most strongly affected by this dark drag and place constraints on specific dark matter distributions and interaction strengths, assuming both elastic and inelastic scattering. For inelastic DM, we find sensitivity to mass splittings that reach the MeV scale. We also demonstrate that a DM-induced drag force could potentially contribute to the observed depletion of red giant branch stars in the innermost region of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>2025-10-01, <strong>Boltzmann Suppressed Ultraviolet Freeze-in</strong>, Nicolás Bernal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01311v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01311v1</a></p>

<p>If the dark matter mass $m$ exceed the maximum temperature of the Universe ($T_{\rm max} &lt; m$), then its production rate will be Boltzmann suppressed. The important implications of this Boltzmann suppression have been explored for dark matter freeze-in via renormalizable operators. Here we extend these considerations to the case of ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in for which freeze-in proceeds via non-renormalizable operators. The UV freeze-in variant has a number of appealing features, not least that a given effective field theory can describe a multitude of UV completions, and thus such analyses are model agnostic for a given high dimension freeze-in operator. We undertake model independent analyses of UV freeze-in for portal operators of general mass dimensions. Subsequently, we explore a number of specific examples, namely, Higgs portals, bino dark matter, and gravitino dark matter. Finally, we discuss how significant differences arise if one departs from the standard assumptions regarding inflationary reheating (i.e. transitions from an early matter dominated era to radiation domination). As a motivated example we examine the implications of early kination domination. Boltzmann suppressed UV freeze-in is well motivated and permits a number of compelling scenarios. In particular, we highlight that for $T_{\rm max} \sim$ 1 TeV it is feasible that the freeze-in mechanism is entirely realized within a couple of orders of magnitude of the TeV scale, making it experimentally accessible in contrast to traditional freeze-in scenarios.</p>

<p>2025-10-01, <strong>Robust bounds on MACHOs from the faintest galaxies</strong>, Peter W. Graham et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01310v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01310v1</a></p>

<p>We use the dynamical heating of stars in ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies to set limits on Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). In our analysis we study the robustness of the bounds under uncertainties in key UFD parameters, such as the half-light radius, stellar velocity dispersion, total halo mass and dark matter and stellar density profiles. We apply this framework to both well-established UFD candidates, as well as the recently discovered UFD candidate Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1. We find that multiple UFDs yield consistently strong limits in the mass range $10\, M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm MACHO} \lesssim 10^9\, M_\odot$, underscoring the robustness of a previous analysis solely based on Segue I. We also demonstrate that Ursa Major III, if confirmed as an UFD, would improve the constraints significantly, providing the strongest constraints on MACHO dark matter in the mass range $1\, M_{\odot}\lesssim M_{\rm MACHO} \lesssim 10^5\, M_\odot$.</p>

<p>2025-10-01, <strong>CosmoUiT: A Vision Transformer-UNet Hybrid for Fast and Accurate Emulation of 21-cm Maps from the Epoch of Reionization</strong>, Prasad Rajesh Posture et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01121v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01121v1</a></p>

<p>The observation of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the intergalactic medium will probe the epoch of reionization (EoR) with unprecedented detail. Various simulations are being developed and used to predict and understand the nature and morphology of this signal. However, these simulations are computationally very expensive and time-consuming to produce in large numbers. To overcome this problem, an efficient field-level emulator of this signal is required. However, the EoR 21-cm signal is highly non-Gaussian; therefore, capturing the correlations between different scales of this signal, which is directly related to the evolution of the reionization, with the neural network is quite difficult. Here, we introduce CosmoUiT, a UNet integrated vision transformer-based architecture, to overcome these difficulties. CosmoUiT emulates the 3D cubes of 21-cm signal from the EoR, for a given input dark matter density field, halo density field, and reionization parameters. CosmoUiT uses the multi-head self-attention mechanism of the transformer to capture the long-range dependencies and convolutional layers in the UNet to capture the small-scale variations in the target 21-cm field. Furthermore, the training of the emulator is conditioned on the input reionization parameters such that it gives a fast and accurate prediction of the 21-cm field for different sets of input reionization parameters. We evaluate the predictions of our emulator by comparing various statistics (e.g., bubble size distribution, power spectrum) and morphological features of the emulated and simulated maps. We further demonstrate that this vision transformer-based architecture can emulate the entire 3D 21-cm signal cube with high accuracy at both large and small scales.</p>

<p>2025-10-01, <strong>Fuzzy dark matter dynamical friction: Defying galactic cannibalism of globular clusters</strong>, Adrian Szpilfidel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00927v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.00927v1</a></p>

<p>We present a new implementation of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) dynamical friction within the galpy framework, enabling orbital integrations of globular clusters (GCs) across a broad range of halo-to-GC mass ratios and boson masses. In this alternative DM scenario, dynamical friction is reduced or even suppressed by heating induced by FDM density granules. We further quantify the role of baryons and solitonic cores, natural consequences of FDM in galaxies, on the efficiency of orbital decay and the long-term survival of GCs. The most significant deviations from the cold DM (CDM) paradigm arise in the dwarf-galaxy regime, where FDM dynamical friction can stall the inspiral of GCs over a Hubble time, thereby preventing their sinking into galactic centers and halting the canonical galactic cannibalism of clusters. Importantly, our FDM-only friction model should be regarded as a conservative lower bound, since the inclusion of realistic FDM cores can only strengthen the survival of GCs through core stalling. This stalling mechanism not only preserves in-situ populations that would otherwise be erased in CDM, but also strongly suppresses the mixing of in-situ and ex-situ clusters, yielding a bimodal radial distribution of GCs. Our results show that the demographics of GC systems encode a distinct dynamical signature of FDM in dwarfs. These predictions open a new pathway to constrain the boson mass parameter with upcoming Euclid DR1 observations of extragalactic GCs, while simultaneously offering a natural explanation for the long-standing Fornax timing problem.</p>

<p>We explore the phenomenological consequences of non-minimal hidden sector interactions on observable correlations in the Higgs sector, mediated through the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric Higgs portal. Particular attention is given to non-standard momentum dependencies of the hidden sector scalar, which arise naturally in an effective field theory (EFT) framework. We demonstrate that perturbatively reliable constraints can be derived from four-top quark production data and precision measurements of Higgs couplings. These constraints are especially relevant in parameter regions where destructive interference suppresses invisible Higgs decays to light exotic scalars, keeping them within experimentally allowed limits. Finally, we discuss the implications of such hidden sector interactions for the thermal history of the universe. We show that non-standard momentum dependencies open up the Higgs portal to account for the observed dark matter relic abundance whilst evading current direct detection constraints. They can also be probed at the (HL-)LHC and, ultimately, at future lepton colliders such as a FCC-ee.</p>

<p>The discovery of supermassive black holes with masses $\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$ challenges conventional formation scenarios based on baryonic accretion and mergers within the first few hundred million years. We propose an alternative channel in which ultralight scalar dark matter undergoes dark-to-black conversion via quasi-bound state depletion around black hole seeds. We estimate the accretion rate of the scalar field as a function of the boson mass parameter $\mu$ and the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}$, and integrate this rate over cosmological timescales. Our results show that once a critical value of $\mu M_{\rm BH}$ is reached, scalar field accretion becomes highly efficient, enabling substantial black hole growth even from relatively small initial seed masses. For boson masses $\mu \sim 10^{-19}-10^{-16}\,\mathrm{eV}$, black hole seeds of $10^2-10^5 M_\odot$ can reach $10^6-10^8 M_\odot$ within $\sim 10^8$ yr. This dark-to-black mechanism provides a natural pathway for the rapid formation of massive black holes in the early universe, offering a potential probe of the microphysical nature of dark matter.</p>

<p>We investigate FLRW cosmology in the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity with a nonminimal coupling between dark matter and the gravitational field. In the noncoincidence gauge, the field equations admit an equivalent multi-scalar field representation, which we investigate the phase-space using the Hubble-normalization approach. We classify all stationary points for arbitrary function $f(Q)$ and we discuss the physical properties of the asymptotic solutions. For the power-law theory, we perform a detailed stability analysis and show that the de Sitter solution is the unique future attractor, while the matter-dominated point appears as a saddle point. Moreover, there exist a family of scaling solutions that can be related to inflationary dynamics. In contrast with uncoupled $f(Q)$ models, the presence of the coupling introduces a viable matter-dominated era alongside late-time accelerated expansion. Our study shows that the coupling function plays a crucial role in cosmological dynamics in $f(Q)$ gravity.</p>

<p>We present a timing study of the three known central compact object (CCO) pulsars, isolated cooling neutron stars in supernova remnants, using Chandra, XMM-Newton and NICER observations spanning two decades. Relative to canonical young pulsars, CCOs are spinning down at a very slow rate $|\dot f| &lt;10^{-15}$ s$^{-2}$, implying a surface dipole magnetic field strength $B_s &lt; 10^{11}$ G that is too weak to account for their X-ray emitting hot spots. Two CCO pulsars with sufficiently long monitoring, 1E 1207.4$-$5209 and PSR J0821$-$4300, are seen to deviate from steady spin-down; their timing residuals can be modeled by one or more glitches in $f$ and $\dot f$, or alternatively by extreme timing noise. For the third CCO pulsar, PSR J1852+0400, the sparse temporal coverage was insufficient to detect such effects. Glitch activity and timing noise in large samples of rotation-powered pulsars correlate best with $\dot f$, while the timing irregularities of the first two CCOs are extreme compared to pulsars of the same $\dot f$. Nevertheless, timing activity in CCOs may arise from properties that they share with other young but more energetic pulsars: high internal temperature, strong buried magnetic field and superfluid behavior. Alternatively, continuing low-level accretion of supernova debris is not ruled out as a source of timing noise in CCOs.</p>

<p>Using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code MESA, we find that all our models in the initial mass range of 12-40 Mo, regardless of whether they have hydrogen-rich, hydrogen-stripped, or helium+hydrogen-stripped envelopes, have at least one significant strong convective zone in the inner core, which can facilitate the jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We focus on stripped-envelope CCSN progenitors that earlier studies of the JJEM did not study, and examine the angular momentum parameter j=rVconv, where r is the radius of the layer and Vconv is the convective velocity according to the mixing length theory. In all models, there is at least one prominent convective zone with j&gt;2e15 cm^2/s inside the mass coordinate that is the maximum baryonic mass of a neutron star (NS), m=2.65 Mo. According to the JJEM, convection in these zones seeds instabilities above the newly born NS, leading to the formation of intermittent accretion disks that launch pairs of jittering jets, which in turn explode the star. Our finding is encouraging for the JJEM, although it does not show that the intermittent accretion disks indeed form. We strengthen the claim that, according to the JJEM, there are no failed CCSNe and that all massive stars explode. In demonstrating the robust convection in the inner core of stripped-envelope CCSN progenitors, we add to the establishment of the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</p>

<p>The supernova remnant (SNR) S147 contains the pulsar PSR J0538+2817 and a likely unbound binary companion, HD 37424. It is the only good Galactic candidate for a binary unbound by a core-collapse supernova (SN). Using Gaia DR3 parallaxes and photometry, we select the stars local to SNR S147 in a cylinder with a projected radius of $100$ pc and a parallax range of $0.614 &lt; \varpi &lt; 0.787$ mas (a length of $\simeq 360$ pc). We individually model the most luminous of these stars. The two most luminous single stars are the unbound binary companion, HD 37424, and HD 37367, with estimated masses of $(13.51\pm0.05) M_{\odot}$ and $(14.30\pm0.09) M_{\odot}$, respectively. The two most luminous binary systems are the spectroscopic binary HD 37366 and the eclipsing binary ET Tau that have primary masses of $(20.9\pm0.12) M_{\odot}$ and $(16.7\pm0.09) M_{\odot}$, respectively. We model the Gaia color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of this local stellar population using both single stars and a model consisting of noninteracting binaries using Solar metallicity PARSEC isochrones. For both models, the estimated age distributions of the $439$ $M_{G} &lt; 0$ mag stars favor a high mass progenitor of $21.5M_{\odot}-41.1M_{\odot}$ for the SN.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>BAO miscalibration cannot rescue late-time solutions to the Hubble tension</strong>, Davide Pedrotti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01974v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01974v1</a></p>

<p>Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements play a key role in ruling out post-recombination solutions to the Hubble tension. However, because the data compression leading to these measurements assumes a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, their reliability in testing late-time modifications to $\Lambda$CDM has at times been called into question. We play devil’s advocate and posit that fiducial cosmology assumptions do indeed affect BAO measurements in such a way that low-redshift acoustic angular scales (proportional to the Hubble constant $H_0$) are biased low, and test whether such a rescaling can rescue post-recombination solutions. The answer is no. Firstly, strong constraints on the shape of the $z \lesssim 2$ expansion history from unanchored Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) prevent large deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. In addition, unless $\Omega_m$ is significantly lower than $0.3$, the rescaled BAO measurements would be in strong tension with geometrical information from the Cosmic Microwave Background. We demonstrate this explicitly on several dark energy (DE) models ($w$CDM, CPL DE, phenomenologically emergent DE, holographic DE, $\Lambda_s$CDM, and the negative cosmological constant model), finding that none can address the Hubble tension once unanchored SNeIa are included. We argue that the $\Lambda_s$CDM sign-switching cosmological constant model possesses interesting features which make it the least unpromising one among those tested. Our results demonstrate that possible fiducial cosmology-induced BAO biases cannot be invoked as loopholes to the Hubble tension “no-go theorem”, and highlight the extremely important but so far underappreciated role of unanchored SNeIa in ruling out post-recombination solutions.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Orbital Period Changes of Recurrent Nova U Scorpii Demonstrate that M$<em>{\rm ejecta}$=26$\times$M$</em>{\rm accreted}$ and Is Not a Type Ia Supernova Progenitor</strong>, Bradley E. Schaefer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01589v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01589v1</a></p>

<p>Recurrent nova U Scorpii (U Sco) is one of the prototypes for a Type Ia supernova progenitor. The logic is that the white dwarf is near the Chandrasekhar mass and gas is accumulating onto its surface at a near-maximal accretion rate, so it will soon increase its mass to the supernova trigger. But the white dwarf loses mass every nova eruption, so the issue is balancing the mass ejected ($M_{\rm ejecta}$) against the mass accreted between eruptions ($M_{\rm accreted}$). Measuring $M_{\rm accreted}$ can be done in several ways to useable accuracy. But the old methods for measuring $M_{\rm ejecta}$ (involving the flux in hydrogen emission lines) are all with real error bars of 2–3 orders of magnitude. The only solution is to measure the change of the orbital period across the nova eruption ($\Delta P$). But this solution requires a vast photometric program of eclipse timings stretching decades. For U Sco, a program started in 1989, now reaches its culmination with measures of $\Delta P$ for the eruptions of 1999, 2010, 2016, and 2022. This paper reports on 52 new eclipse times (for a total of 218 eclipses 1945–2025), plus a new theory result allowing for the confident calculation of $M_{\rm ejecta}$ from $\Delta P$. The four eruptions ejected a total of (103$\pm$14)$\times\(10^{-6}$ $M\_{\odot}$, while the white dwarf accreted 4$\times\)10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$ over the four previous eruption cycles. With M$_{\rm ejecta}$=26$\times$M$_{\rm accreted}$, the U Sco white dwarf is losing large masses each eruption cycle, so U Sco can never produce a Type Ia supernova.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Orbital Period Changes in Recurrent Nova T Corona Borealis Prove That It Is Not a Type Ia Supernovae Progenitor</strong>, Bradley E. Schaefer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01587v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01587v1</a></p>

<p>T Corona Borealis (T CrB) is a recurrent nova and a symbiotic star that is commonly highlighted as the best case for being a progenitor of a Type Ia supernova (SNIa) within the framework of single-degenerate models. This exemplar can be tested by measuring whether the white dwarf (WD) mass ($M_{\rm WD}$) is increasing over each eruption cycle. This is a balance between the mass ejected during each nova event ($M_{\rm ejecta}$) and the mass accreted onto the WD between the nova events ($M_{\rm accreted}$). I have used all 206 radial velocities from 1946–2024 to measure the orbital period just after the 1946 eruption to be $P_{\rm post}$=227.6043 days, while the steady orbital period change ($\dot{P}$) is ($-$3.1$\pm$1.6)$\times$10$^{-6}$. I have used my full 213,730 magnitude $B$ and $V$ light curve from 1842–2025 to measure the times of maximum brightness in the ellipsoidal modulations to construct the $O-C$ from 1866–1946. I fit the broken parabola shape, to find the orbital period immediately before the 1946 eruption to be $P_{\rm pre}$=227.4586 days. The orbital period changed by $\Delta P$=$+$0.146$\pm$0.019 days. With Kepler’s Law, conservation of angular momentum, and the well-measured binary properties, the ejecta mass in 1946 is 0.00074$\pm$0.00009 M$_{\odot}$. $M_{\rm accreted}$ is reliably measured to be 1.38$\times$10$^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$ from the accretion luminosity. $M_{\rm ejecta}$ is larger than $M_{\rm accreted}$ by 540$\times$, so $M_{\rm WD}$ is {\it decreasing} every eruption cycle. T CrB can never become a SNIa.</p>

<p>2025-10-01, <strong>Discovery of diffuse gamma-ray emission in the vicinity of G172.8+1.5: An old supernova remnant with different turbulence properties</strong>, Yuan Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01340v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01340v1</a></p>

<p>We report the detection of high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission in the vicinity of G172.8+1.5, which is debated as a Supernova remnant (SNR) or an ionized hydrogen (H$_{\rm{II}}$) region. Using 16-yr Pass 8 data from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we found the GeV emission can be described by two extended sources with different photon spectra. Among them, the much more extended $\gamma$-ray source SrcA with a Power-law spectrum is spatially coincident with a giant neutral Hydrogen shell structure and several OB stars inside a huge H$_{\rm{II}}$ region. The softer Log-Parabola spectra $\gamma$-ray source SrcB is spatially coincident with a star-forming region with several OB stars, maser sources and IR sources. Gas observation results display a dense molecular cloud surrounding SrcB in the velocity range of [-25,-5] km s$^{-1}$. The possible origins of $\gamma$-ray emission are discussed, including CRs escaped from SNR shock surface and illuminated nearby MC, the young massive star clusters associated with the star-forming region and a pulsar halo generated by an invisible energetic pulsar inside the SNR. Furthermore, under the hadronic scenario, the measured diffusion coefficient in the compact SrcB region is significantly lower than that of the more extended SrcA. This suppression is likely attributed to cosmic-ray-driven instabilities, which reduce the diffusion efficiency in the vicinity of the source relative to the standard conditions in the interstellar medium (ISM). Future advanced analysis from LHAASO observation results would help distinguish the origins of $\gamma$-ray emission in this region and clarify the nature of this source.</p>

<p>The magnification resulting from strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool to add new constraints to the cosmic evolution of supernova progenitors by enabling the study of distant supernovae that would otherwise not be observable. iPTF16geu is the most well-observed gravitationally lensed supernova (glSN) to date. At a redshift of $z = 0.409$ and magnified by a factor of $\sim$68, extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations have been obtained. The explosion mechanism producing this rare event and differences compared to lower redshift supernovae however have not been explored in detail. Here we compare observations of iPTF16geu to existing radiative transfer simulations of type Ia supernova explosion models selected from the literature. We find that overall the DDC6 and PDDEL1 models, specific variations of the delayed detonation explosion scenario, produce the closest match to the light curves and many absorption features, but struggle to replicate the observed colours and in particular the rest-frame UV. We also investigate the magnification and reddening values required to improve agreement with the selected models. We find some evidence in favour of a UV flux excess that may be intrinsic to iPTF16geu or due to external factors such as host galaxy subtraction and uncertainties in the reddening law. Upcoming surveys will significantly increase the samples of SNe discovered at high redshifts due to strong gravitational lensing. These glSNe will enable tighter constraints on the explosion physics of type Ia supernovae and how this has evolved throughout the Universe.</p>

<p>2025-10-01, <strong>The Silicon Strip Detector Subsystem for the Trans-Iron Galactic Element Recorder for the International Space Station (TIGERISS)</strong>, John F. Krizmanic et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01081v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01081v1</a></p>

<p>The Trans-Iron Galactic Element Recorder for the International Space Station (TIGERISS) is under construction and is planned for launch in 2027 and will be attached at the SOX location on the Columbus module on the ISS. TIGERISS will make the first definitive measurements of Ultra-Heavy Galactic Cosmic Rays (UHGCRs; Z &gt;29) on an individual element basis past barium ($^{56}$Ba), through the lanthinides, and to lead ($^{82}$Pb). TIGERISS has a geometry factor of 1.06 m$^2$ sr and is comprised of four planes of single-sided silicon strip detectors (SSDs) arranged in orthogonal X-Y layers with an X-Y pair above and an X-Y pair below two large-area Cherenkov detectors. The top Cherenkov detector is comprised of a mosaic of aerogel radiators (n =1.05) while the bottom Cherenkov detector has an acrylic radiator (n = 1.49). The combination of the Cherenkov velocity measurements with the precise measurements of the ionization and trajectory of the traversing cosmic rays leads to highly accurate charge measurements of $&lt;$ 0.25 c.u. over the entire elemental range of $^5$B through $^{82}$Pb. These TIGERISS measurements are highly sensitive in determining the strength of s-process, r-process, and rp-processes of Galactic nucleosynthesis while providing critical data needed for multi-messenger studies to determine the contributions of extreme phenomena, including supernovae (SN) and Neutron Star Mergers (NSMs), in the production of galactic matter. The science goals of TIGERISS, mission status, instrument design and performance of the TIGERISS SSD subsystem in relation to the measurements and science goals of TIGERISS are discussed in this paper.</p>

<p>2025-10-01, <strong>Revisiting the formation of molecules and dust in core collapse supernovae</strong>, Isabelle Cherchneff et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01079v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01079v1</a></p>

<p>Context. Core-collapse Supernovae of Type II contribute the chemical enrichment of galaxies through explosion. Their role as dust producers in the high-redshift Universe may be of paramount importance. However, the type and amount of dust they synthesise after outburst is still a matter of debate and the formation processes remain unclear.   Aims. We aim to identify and understand the chemical processes at play in the dust formation scenario, and derive mass yields for molecules and dust clusters at late post-explosion time. Methods. We revisit existing models by improving on the physics and chemistry of the supernova ejecta. We identify and consider new chemical species and pathways underpinning the formation of dust clusters, and apply a unique exhaustive chemical network to the entire ejecta of a Supernova with a 15 Msun progenitor. We test this new chemistry for various gas conditions in the ejecta, and derive mass yields for molecules and dust clusters.   Results. We obtain the molecular component of the ejecta up to 11 years after explosion. The most abundant species are, in order of decreasing masses, O2, CO, SiS, SiO, CO2, SO2, CaS, N2, and CS. We identify molecules that are tracers of high-density clumps. As for dust clusters, we find the composition is dominated by silicates and silica, along with carbon dust, but with modest amounts of alumina. Pure metal clusters and metal sulphide and oxide clusters have negligible masses. High-density gas favours the formation of carbon clusters in the outer ejecta region whereas low temperatures hamper the formation of silicates in the oxygen core. The results are in good agreement with existing astronomical data and recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. They highlight the importance of chemistry for the derivation of dust budget from Supernovae.</p>

<p>2025-10-01, <strong>Forecasting the Observable Rates of Gravitationally Lensed Supernovae for the PASSAGES Dusty Starbursts</strong>, Patrick S. Kamieneski et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00923v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.00923v1</a></p>

<p>More than 60 years have passed since the first formal suggestion to use strongly-lensed supernovae to measure the expansion rate of the Universe through time-delay cosmography. Yet, fewer than 10 such objects have ever been discovered. We consider the merits of a targeted strategy focused on lensed hyperluminous infrared galaxies – among the most rapidly star-forming galaxies known in the Universe. With star formation rates (SFRs) $\sim {200 - 6000}~\textrm{M}_\odot~\textrm{yr}^{-1}$, the $\sim 30$ objects in the Planck All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts (PASSAGES) are excellent candidates for a case study, in particular, and have already led to the discovery of the multiply-imaged SN H0pe. Considering their lens model-corrected SFRs, we estimate their intrinsic supernova rates to be an extraordinary ${1.8 - 65}~\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ (core-collapse) and ${0.2 - 6.4}~\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ (Type Ia). Moreover, these massive starbursts typically have star-forming companions which are unaccounted for in this tally. We demonstrate a strong correlation between Einstein radius and typical time delays, with cluster lenses often exceeding several months (and therefore most favorable for high-precision $H_0$ inferences). A multi-visit monitoring campaign with a sensitive infrared telescope (namely, JWST) is necessary to mitigate dust attenuation. Still, a porous interstellar medium and clumpy star formation in these extreme galaxies might produce favorable conditions for detecting supernovae as transient point sources. Targeted campaigns of known lensed galaxies to discover new lensed supernovae can greatly complement wide-area cadenced surveys. Increasing the sample size helps to realize the potential of supernova time-delay cosmography to elucidate the Hubble tension through a single-step measurement, independent of other $H_0$ techniques.</p>
