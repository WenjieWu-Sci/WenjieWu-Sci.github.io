<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Reconstruction and Performance Evaluation of FASER’s Emulsion Detector at the LHC</strong>, FASER Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13008v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.13008v1</a></p>

<p>This paper presents the reconstruction and performance evaluation of the FASER$\nu$ emulsion detector, which aims to measure interactions from neutrinos produced in the forward direction of proton-proton collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The detector, composed of tungsten plates interleaved with emulsion films, records charged particles with sub-micron precision. A key challenge arises from the extremely high track density environment, reaching $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ tracks per cm$^2$. To address this, dedicated alignment techniques and track reconstruction algorithms have been developed, building on techniques from previous experiments and introducing further optimizations. The performance of the detector is studied by evaluating the single-film efficiency, position and angular resolution, and the impact parameter distribution of reconstructed vertices. The results demonstrate that an alignment precision of 0.3 micrometers and robust track and vertex reconstruction are achieved, enabling accurate neutrino measurements in the TeV energy range.</p>

<p>We demonstrate the prompt-delayed signals induced by knockout neutrons from the quasi-elastic scattering in neutrino experiments provides a new avenue for detecting light dark matter. As an illustration, we consider the detection of atmospheric dark matter in the liquid scintillator detectors. The results show that the constraint on the DM-nucleon interaction from KamLAND is approximately one order of magnitude more stringent than those obtained from the elastic nuclear recoil signals in dark matter direct detection experiments. Furthermore, a larger volume neutrino experiment, such as JUNO, is expected to significantly enhance the light dark matter detection sensitivity through the quasi-elastic scattering.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Lessons from commissioning of the cryogenic system for the Short-Baseline Neutrino Detector at Fermilab</strong>, Frederick Schwartz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12969v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12969v1</a></p>

<p>Results from commissioning and first year of operations of the cryogenic system of the Short-Baseline Neutrino Detector (SBND) and its membrane cryostat installed at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory are described. The SBND detector is installed in a 200 m$^3$ membrane cryostat filled with liquid argon, which serves both as target and as active media. For the correct operation of the detector, the liquid argon must be kept in very stable thermal conditions while the contamination of electronegative impurities must be consistently kept at the level of small fractions of parts per billion. The detector is operated in Booster Neutrino Beams (BNB) at Fermilab for the search of sterile neutrinos and measurements of neutrino-argon cross sections. The cryostat and the cryogenic systems also serve as prototypes for the much larger equipment to be used for the LBNF/DUNE experiment. Since its installation in 2018-2023 and cooldown in spring of 2024, the cryostat and the cryogenic system have been commissioned to support the detector operations. The lessons learned through installation, testing, commissioning, cooldown, and initial operations are described.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Phenomenology of Inverse Seesaw Using $S_3$ Modular Symmetry</strong>, Mitesh Kumar Behera et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12954v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12954v1</a></p>

<p>Describing neutrino masses using the inverse seesaw mechanism with discrete flavor symmetry imposed through modular forms provides a testable framework at TeV scales with fewer parameters. However, $S_3$, the smallest modular group, remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we construct the minimal supersymmetric inverse seesaw model based on the modular $S_3$ flavor symmetry. In our model, the light neutrino mass matrix depends on 6 real parameters: the complex modulus, an overall scale for light neutrino mass, a real ratio and a complex ratio of Yukawa coupling. Thanks to its minimality, our model offers various definite predictions: the lightest neutrino is massless, the neutrino masses are inverted ordering, the sum of the three light neutrino masses ($\sum_i m_i$) is 100 meV, the effective mass for the end point of the beta decay spectrum is 50 meV, the effective mass for neutrinoless double beta decay ($m_{ee}$) is in the range $38-58$ meV. In particular, the predicted values for $\sum_i m_i$ and $m_{ee}$ from our model are within reach of the next generation experiments. Our model also predicts radiative lepton flavor violating decays $\ell\to\ell’\gamma$ which are compatible with experimental constraints.</p>

<p>2025-04-16, <strong>Heavy neutrino mixing prospects at hadron colliders: a machine learning study</strong>, Si-Yu Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12141v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12141v1</a></p>

<p>We apply machine learning to the searches of heavy neutrino mixing in the inverse seesaw in the framework of left-right symmetric model at the high-energy hadron colliders. The Majorana nature of heavy neutrinos can induce the processes $pp \to W_R^\pm \to \ell_\alpha^\pm N \to \ell_\alpha^\pm \ell_\beta^{\mp,\,\pm} jj$, with opposite-sign (OS) and same-sign (SS) dilepton and two jets in the final state. The distributions of the charged leptons $\ell = e ,\, \mu$ and jets and their correlations are utilized as input for machine learning analysis. It is found that for both the OS and SS processes, XGBoost can efficiently distinguish signals from the standard model backgrounds. We estimate the sensitivities of heavy neutrino mass $m_N$ and their mixing in the OS and SS $ee$, $\mu\mu$ and $e\mu$ final states at $\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV, 27 TeV and 100 TeV. It turns out that the heavy neutrinos can be probed up to 17.1 TeV and 19.5 TeV in the OS and SS channels, respectively. The sine of the mixing angle of heavy neutrinos can be probed up to the maximal value of $\sqrt2/2$ and 0.69 in the OS and SS channels, respectively.</p>

<p>2025-04-16, <strong>A Light Lepton-flavor-violating Flavon: the Messenger of Neutrino Mixing and Muon $g-2$</strong>, Shuyang Han et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12070v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12070v1</a></p>

<p>In neutrino physics, a class of models with local or global family symmetries may be invoked, and then a flavon field is needed to realize the full neutrino mixing. This flavon may shed light on the long-standing muon $g-2$ puzzle. In this work, we explore this idea in the $({B-L})_{13}$ gauge extension to the standard model (SM), in which realistic neutrino mixing requires both a SM singlet flavon $s$ and a vector-like lepton (VLL) doublet. The dominant coupling between the flavon and leptons is in the manner of lepton-flavor-violation (LFV). Through an analytical analysis of the SM lepton-VLL mixing matrix, we find that the parameter space of the $s\bar\mu e$-type flavon to explain the muon $g-2$ has been completely excluded by the specific LFV process, muonium-antimuonium oscillation. But the $s\bar\mu \tau$-type flavon still has the opportunity; however, it confronts the strong constraint from $\tau\to \mu$ conservation and, in particular, the lepton flavor universality test of $Z$ boson decay, which arises due to our way to realize the LFV flavon. The surviving flavon is highly predictable, with mass in the narrow window $m_\tau\lesssim m_s\lesssim 1.5~ m_\tau$ and LFV coupling strength $\sim 10^{-2}$. Besides, it leaves a TeV scale VLL with a multi-lepton signature at the LHC.</p>

<p>2025-04-16, <strong>Low-energy neutrino responses for 71Ga by electron capture rates, charge exchange reactions and shell model calculations</strong>, Yoritaka Iwata et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11736v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.11736v1</a></p>

<p>Weak Gamow-Teller (GT) responses for low-lying states in ${}^{71}\mathrm{Ga}$ are crucial for studying low-energy solar neutrinos and the Ga anomaly, i.e., the possible transition to the sterile state. The responses for the ground state, the first excited state, and the second excited state are evaluated for the first time using the experimental electron capture rates, the experimental charge exchange reaction (CER) rates corrected for the tensor-interaction effect and the theoretical interacting shell model (ISM) calculations. The contributions from the two excited states to the solar and ${}^{51}\mathrm{Cr}$ neutrinos are found to be $4.2 \pm 1.2\%$ of that for the ground state. This is slightly larger than the ISM values but little smaller than the CER values without corrections for the tensor interaction effect. The Ga anomaly is far beyond the uncertainty of the obtained nuclear responses.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Purely gravitational dark matter production in warm inflation</strong>, Qing-Yang Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13147v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.13147v1</a></p>

<p>We consider an appealing scenario for the production of purely gravitational dark matter in the background of warm inflation, a mechanism that maintains stable thermal bath during inflation. Through systematic investigation of various gravitational production channels, we reveal distinctive features compared to the standard inflation scenario. Notably, the inflaton annihilation channel in warm inflation exhibits markedly different thermodynamics from the standard inflation paradigm, leading to a suppression on the production of sub-inflaton-mass dark matter. For the production channel of inflationary vacuum fluctuations, we find a correlation of $\rho_\chi\propto m_\chi^{5/2}$ for the conformally coupled dark matter, which expands the feasible range of dark matter mass. Our results also indicates that a minimum temperature threshold of $10^{-6}M_P$ is necessary for warm inflation, which allows adequate dark matter production. With observational constraints, our results provide stringent limits on the mass range of purely gravitational dark matter with sufficient density: $10^{-8}-10^{-2}M_P$ for minimal coupling and $10^{-14}-10^{-2}M_P$ for conformal coupling.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Absorption of Fermionic Dark Matter in the PICO-60 C$<em>{3}$F$</em>{8}$ Bubble Chamber</strong>, E. Adams et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13089v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.13089v1</a></p>

<p>Fermionic dark matter absorption on nuclear targets via neutral current interactions is explored using a non-relativistic effective field theory framework. An analysis of data from the PICO-60 C$_{3}$F$_{8}$ bubble chamber sets leading constraints on spin-independent absorption for dark matter masses below 23 MeV/$\textit{c}^2$ and establishes the first limits on spin-dependent absorptive interactions. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of bubble chambers to low-mass dark matter and underscore the importance of absorption searches in expanding the parameter space of direct detection experiments.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Euclid preparation. Estimating galaxy physical properties using CatBoost chained regressors with attention</strong>, Euclid Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13020v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.13020v1</a></p>

<p>Euclid will image ~14000 deg^2 of the extragalactic sky at visible and NIR wavelengths, providing a dataset of unprecedented size and richness that will facilitate a multitude of studies into the evolution of galaxies. In the vast majority of cases the main source of information will come from broad-band images and data products thereof. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify or develop scalable yet reliable methodologies to estimate the redshift and physical properties of galaxies using broad-band photometry from Euclid, optionally including ground-based optical photometry also. To address this need, we present a novel method to estimate the redshift, stellar mass, star-formation rate, specific star-formation rate, E(B-V), and age of galaxies, using mock Euclid and ground-based photometry. The main novelty of our property-estimation pipeline is its use of the CatBoost implementation of gradient-boosted regression-trees, together with chained regression and an intelligent, automatic optimization of the training data. The pipeline also includes a computationally-efficient method to estimate prediction uncertainties, and, in the absence of ground-truth labels, provides accurate predictions for metrics of model performance up to z~2. We apply our pipeline to several datasets consisting of mock Euclid broad-band photometry and mock ground-based ugriz photometry, to evaluate the performance of our methodology for estimating the redshift and physical properties of galaxies detected in the Euclid Wide Survey. The quality of our photometric redshift and physical property estimates are highly competitive overall, validating our modeling approach. We find that the inclusion of ground-based optical photometry significantly improves the quality of the property estimation, highlighting the importance of combining Euclid data with ancillary ground-based optical data.

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Calibrating the SIDM Gravothermal Catastrophe with N-body Simulations</strong>, Charlie Mace et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13004v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.13004v1</a></p>

<p>Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) theories predict that dark matter halos experience core-collapse in late-stage evolution, a process where the halo’s inner region rapidly increases in density and decreases in size. This process can be modeled by treating the dark matter as a gravothermal fluid, and solving the fluid equations to predict the density profile evolution. This model is incomplete without calibration to N-body simulations, through a constant factor $\beta$ included in the thermal conductivity for the long-mean-free-path limit. The value of $\beta$ employed in the gravothermal fluid formalism has varied between studies, with no clear universal value in the literature. In this work, we use the N-body code Arepo to conduct a series of isolated core-collapse simulations across a range of scattering cross-sections, halo concentrations, and halo masses to calibrate the heat transfer parameter $\beta$. We find that $\beta$ is independent of cross-section, halo concentration, and halo mass for velocity independent elastic scattering cross-sections. We present a model for an effective $\beta$ as a function of a dimensionless cross-section, to describe halo evolution in the long mean free path limit, and show that it accurately captures halo evolution as long as the cross section is not too large. This effective model facilitates comparisons between simulations and the gravothermal model, and enables fast predictions of the dark matter density profile at any given time without running N-body simulations.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Performance of the advanced gamma-ray trigger system for the High Energy Cosmic Radiation Detection (HERD) facility</strong>, Keerthana Rajan Lathika et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12930v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12930v1</a></p>

<p>The High Energy Cosmic-Radiation Detection (HERD) facility has been proposed as a leading experiment on China’s Space Station (CSS). Scheduled for installation around 2027, HERD is expected to operate for at least a decade. The main scientific objectives include indirect detection of dark matter with unprecedented sensitivity, studying the cosmic-ray spectrum and composition up to the knee, and observing all-sky gamma rays with energies above 100 MeV. HERD is designed as a large-acceptance telescope with a unique design aimed at maximizing its efficiency. It comprises a central 3D imaging calorimeter (CALO) made of LYSO crystals, encircled by four complementary subdetectors on its top and four lateral faces: the scintillating fiber tracking detector (FIT), the plastic scintillator detector (PSD), the silicon charge detector (SCD), and a transition radiation detector (TRD) on one lateral side. To fully harness HERD gamma-ray detection capabilities down to 100 MeV, an advanced ultra-low-energy gamma-ray (ULEG) trigger system has been developed. We present an extensive overview of the design, performance, and optimization of the gamma-ray trigger system supported by software simulations and preliminary results from the successful implementation of the HERD prototype at CERN’s PS and SPS beam test campaigns in Fall 2023.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>A two-component dark matter model with $Z_2 \times Z_4$ symmetry</strong>, XinXin Qi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12876v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12876v1</a></p>

<p>We consider a two-component dark matter model with $Z_2 \times Z_4$ symmetry, where a singlet scalar $S$ and a Majorana fermion $\chi$ are introduced as dark matter candidates. We also introduce another singlet scalar $S_0$ with a non-zero vacuum expectation value to the SM so that the fermion dark matter can obtain mass after spontaneous symmetry breaking. We have a new Higgs boson in the model and in the case of the decoupling limit, the fermion dark matter production is only determined by $S$ and the new Higgs boson. The mass hierarchy of these new particles can make a difference in the reaction rate of dark matter annihilation processes, contributing to different viable parameter spaces for different mass orderings. We randomly scanned the parameter space with six various cases under relic density constraint and found that when $\chi$ is the lightest among the dark sector, $\chi$ production is generated via the so-called forbidden channels. Moreover, we consider the combined limits arising from Higgs invisible decay, dark matter relic density and direct detection constraints. Within the chosen parameter space, direct detection results put the most stringent constraint, and we have a more flexible value for the scalar dark matter mass when the mass of $\chi$ is not smaller than the new Higgs boson mass.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Skewness as a Probe of Gravity: Real and Redshift Space Counts-In-Cells</strong>, Paweł Drozda et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12820v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12820v1</a></p>

<p>We study the counts-in-cells reduced skewness $s_3$ for dark matter, halo, and galaxy distributions in both real and redshift space, using the ELEPHANT ($\textit{Extended LEnsing PHysics with ANalytical ray Tracing}$) suite of $N$-body simulations. We compare General Relativity (GR) with two extended (EG) gravity models: $f(R)$ gravity with chameleon screening and the normal-branch Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) model with Vainshtein screening. We quantify the suppression of $s_3$ by redshift-space distortions (RSD), finding that while small-scale skewness is strongly reduced, the $F5$ model retains a $\sim 4\%$ deviation from GR in galaxy samples, corresponding to a $2\sigma$ significance. We show that the ratio $s_3^{\mathrm{RSD}}/s_3^{\mathrm{real}}$ is approximately independent of the gravity model across tracers and redshifts. Our results demonstrate that real-space predictions can help reliably infer redshift-space skewness in both GR and extended gravity, providing a new tool for testing gravity with current and forthcoming galaxy redshift surveys.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Notes on optimizing a multi-sensor gradient axion-like particle dark matter search</strong>, Daniel Gavilan-Martin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12815v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12815v1</a></p>

<p>Axion-like particles (ALPs) arise from well-motivated extensions to the Standard Model and could account for the dark matter. We discuss the scaling of the sensitivity of a galactic ALP dark matter search with the number of sensors, especially in the ultra-light mass regime, where the measurement time is shorter than the coherence time of the ALP field. We compare multiple schemes for daily modulated ALP gradient signals, and show that increasing the number of sensors from 1 to 2 improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by a factor of 2-3. For more than two sensors, the SNR increases as the square root of the number of sensors. Then, we show that splitting the data into subsets and then averaging its Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) is equivalent to the DFT of the whole dataset in terms of SNR.</p>

<p>The Proton EDM Experiment (pEDM) is the first direct search for the proton electric dipole moment (EDM) with the aim of being the first experiment to probe the Standard Model (SM) prediction of any particle EDM. Phase-I of pEDM will achieve $10^{-29} e\cdot$cm, improving current indirect limits by four orders of magnitude. This will establish a new standard of precision in nucleon EDM searches and offer a unique sensitivity to better understand the Strong CP problem. The experiment is ideally positioned to explore physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), with sensitivity to axionic dark matter via the signal of an oscillating proton EDM and across a wide mass range of BSM models from $\mathcal{O}(1\text{GeV})$ to $\mathcal{O}(10^3\text{TeV})$. Utilizing the frozen-spin technique in a highly symmetric storage ring that leverages existing infrastructure at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), pEDM builds upon the technological foundation and experimental expertise of the highly successful Muon $g\(-\)2$ Experiments. With significant R\&amp;D and prototyping already underway, pEDM is preparing a conceptual design report (CDR) to offer a cost-effective, high-impact path to discovering new sources of CP violation and advancing our understanding of fundamental physics. It will play a vital role in complementing the physics goals of the next-generation collider while simultaneously contributing to sustaining particle physics research and training early career researchers during gaps between major collider operations.</p>

<p>A recent study using weak gravitational lensing reveals that there are some isolated galaxies having almost flat rotation curves at very large distance from the galactic centres. According to the authors of the study this provides a strong challenge the standard cold dark matter model, since the dark haloes are too small to explain their observations, especially for small stellar masses. In this article, we show that improving their model, the virial radius is larger than their estimates. The NFW rotational curve, and especially the pseudo Isothermal one, are in agreement with their flat rotational curves, especially for the larger baryonic mass bins used by the authors.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Observation of the Axion quasiparticle in 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</strong>, Jian-Xiang Qiu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12572v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12572v1</a></p>

<p>In 1978, Wilczek and Weinberg theoretically discovered a new boson-the Axion-which is the coherent oscillation of the $\theta$ field in QCD. Its existence can solve multiple fundamental questions including the strong CP problem of QCD and the dark matter. However, its detection is challenging because it has almost no interaction with existing particles. Similar $\theta$ has been introduced to condensed matter and so far studied as a static, quantized value to characterize topology of materials. But the coherent oscillation of $\theta$ in condensed matter is proposed to lead to new physics directly analogous to the high-energy Axion particle, the dynamical Axion quasiparticle (DAQ). In this paper, we present the direct observation of the DAQ. By combining 2D electronic device with ultrafast pump-probe optics, we manage to measure the magnetoelectric coupling $\theta$ ($\theta\propto\alpha$) of 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with sub-picosecond time-resolution. This allows us to directly observe the DAQ by seeing a coherent oscillation of $\theta$ at ~44 GHz in real time, which is uniquely induced by the out-of-phase antiferromagnetic magnon. Interestingly, in 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, the DAQ arises from the magnon-induced coherent modulation of Berry curvature. Such ultrafast control of quantum wavefunction can be generalized to manipulate Berry curvature and quantum metric of other materials in ultrafast time-scale. Moreover, the DAQ enables novel quantum physics such as Axion polariton and electric control of ultrafast spin polarization, implying applications in unconventional light-matter interaction and coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Beyond condensed matter, the DAQ can serve as a detector of the dark matter Axion particle. We estimate the detection frequency range and sensitivity in the critically-lacking meV regime, contributing to one of the most challenging questions in fundamental physics.</p>

<p>Dark matter (DM) particles can interact with particles of the Standard Model. Although there exist constraints from direct and indirect detection experiments, the dynamical evolution of astrophysical objects could provide a promising probe for these interactions. Obtaining astrophysical predictions is challenging and limited by our ability to simulate scatterings between DM and baryonic particles within N-body and hydrodynamics simulations. We develop a novel scheme that allows simulating these interacting dark matter (IDM) models and accurately accounts for their angular and velocity dependence, as well as the mass ratio between the DM and baryonic scattering partners. To describe DM-baryon interactions, we use an N-body code together with its implementation of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and meshless finite mass. The interaction itself is realised in a pairwise fashion by creating a virtual scattering partner from the baryonic particle and letting it interact with a DM particle using a scattering routine initially developed for self-interacting dark matter. After the interaction, the virtual particle is rejoined with the baryonic particle, fulfilling energy and momentum conservation. Through several test problems, we demonstrate that we can reproduce their analytic solutions with our IDM scheme. We comment on various numerical aspects and challenges as well as describe the limitations of our numerical scheme. Furthermore, we study the impact of IDM on halo formation with a collapsing overdensity. Overall, it is possible to accurately model IDM within N-body and hydrodynamics simulations, commonly used in astrophysics. In consequence, our scheme allows for making novel predictions and obtaining new constraints of DM-baryon scattering.</p>

<p>We present a mechanism that allows thermal relic dark matter to annihilate efficiently in the Galactic Halo and in galaxy clusters, but not in the lower-velocity environments of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. We realize this within a complete model in which the dark matter consists of two distinct states separated by a small mass splitting. An indirect detection signal is generated only through the coannihilations of these two states, requiring both to be present. In the halo of the Milky Way, the dark matter particles in the lighter state can be excited into the long-lived heavier state through scattering. Once excited, these heavier particles can coannihilate with those in the lighter state, yielding a gamma-ray signal with little or no suppression. By contrast, the dark matter particles in dwarf galaxies do not possess enough kinetic energy to be excited, thereby suppressing the coannihilation rate and corresponding indirect detection signals from those systems. This framework breaks the predictive relationship that ordinarily exists between these respective gamma-ray signals and complicates our ability to interpret the results of indirect detection searches.</p>

<p>We describe a resonant cavity search apparatus for axion dark matter constructed by the Quantum Sensors for the Hidden Sector (QSHS) collaboration. The apparatus is configured to search for QCD axion dark matter, though also has the capability to detect axion-like particles (ALPs), dark photons, and some other forms of wave-like dark matter. Initially, a tuneable cylindrical oxygen-free copper cavity is read out using a low noise microwave amplifier feeding a heterodyne receiver. The cavity is housed in a dilution refrigerator and threaded by a solenoidal magnetic field, nominally 8T. The apparatus also houses a magnetic field shield for housing superconducting electronics, and several other fixed-frequency resonators for use in testing and commissioning various prototype quantum electronic devices sensitive at a range of axion masses in the range $\rm 2.0$ to $\rm 40\,eV/c^2$. We present performance data for the resonator, dilution refrigerator, and magnet, and plans for the first science run.</p>

<p>We present a narrowband imaging on a spectroscopically confirmed protocluster ``D4UD01’’ at z=3.24 using CFHT/WIRCam. We identify a sample of 24 [O III] emission line galaxies in the field, which forms a large overdensity in the protocluster region. The protocluster is expected to evolve into a Virgo-like cluster by z=0. Utilizing multiwavelength data, we derive the physical properties of these [O III] emitters and find they are medium mass normal star-forming galaxies ($\sim10^{10}$M$_\odot$) roughly following the star-forming main sequence. The [O III] emitters trace an overdensity spatially offset from that of photometric-redshift and quiescent galaxies, suggesting these distinct galaxy populations may inhabit dark matter halos that formed at different epochs. A comparative analysis of [O III] emitter properties shows similar characteristics in both protocluster and field environments. This protocluster likely represents an evolved structure that has progressed beyond its peak star-formation phase, although our limited sample size may prevent detection of subtle environmental effects.</p>

<p>In this work, we investigate the discovery reach of a new physics model, the Inert Doublet Model, at an $e^+e^-$ machine with centre-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}$ of 240 and 365 GeV. Within this model, four additional scalar bosons ($H$, $A$, $H^+$ and $H^-$) are predicted. Due to an additional symmetry, the lightest new scalar, here chosen to be $H$, is stable and provides an adequate dark matter candidate. The search for pair production of the new scalars is investigated in final states with two electrons or two muons, in the context of the future circular collider proposal, FCC-ee. Building on previous studies in the context of the CLIC proposal, this analysis extends the search to detector-level objects, using a parametric neural network to enhance the signal contributions over the Standard Model backgrounds, and sets limits in the $m_A-m_H$ vs $m_H$ plane. With a total integrated luminosity of 10.8 (2.7) ab$^{-1}$ for $\sqrt{s}=240$ (365) GeV, almost the entire phase-space available in the $m_A-m_H$ vs $m_H$ plane is expected to be excluded at 95% CL, reaching up to $m_H=110$ (165) GeV. The discovery reach is also explored, reaching $m_H= 108$ (157) GeV for $m_A-m_H=15$ GeV at $\sqrt{s}=240$ (365) GeV.</p>

<p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) can catalyze first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in their vicinity, potentially modifying the gravitational wave (GW) signals from PTs. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of this catalytic effect during supercooled PTs within the high PBH number density regime. Applying the analytical model with envelope approximation, we derive the general expressions of GW spectrum in the presence of PBHs. We find that at relatively small PBH number densities, the GW signals are amplified due to the large-size bubbles. While higher PBH number densities suppress GW signals, since the accelerated PT progresses too rapidly. We further extend our findings to the bulk flow model and to scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs) generated during PTs. By conducting data fitting with the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we find that the PBH catalytic effect significantly alters the estimation of PT parameters. Notably, our analysis of the bubble collision GWs reveals that, the asteroid-mass PBHs ($10^{-16} - 10^{-12} M_\odot$) as the whole dark matter is incompatible with the PT interpretation of pulsar timing array signals. However, incorporating SIGWs can reduce this incompatibility for PBHs in the mass range $10^{-14} - 10^{-12} M_\odot$.</p>

<p>We explore the construction of diverse regular spacetimes (black holes and defects) in General Relativity (GR) using a generic parametrised density profile (the Dekel-Zhao profile), which includes, for specific parameter choices, various well-known examples usually studied in the context of dark matter halos. Our solutions, in the Schwarzschild gauge, include new regular black holes as well as non-singular solutions representing spacetime defects. For a sub-class of metrics, a TOV equation approach with a chosen equation of state works. The status of the energy conditions and the issue of geodesic completeness are explored in detail. We also provide possible Lagrangian density constructions for the matter energy-momentum tensors. Further, we study the shadow radius of the new regular black holes, and compare our findings with available observational results from the EHT collaboration. Finally, for the defect solution, we present a model for a stable star (a gravastar) by explicit use of the junction conditions and obtain relevant consequences highlighting its characteristic features.</p>

<p>A pressureless dark matter component fits well with several cosmological observations. However, there are indications that cold dark matter may encounter challenges in explaining observations at small scales, particularly at galactic scales. Observational data suggest that dark matter models incorporating a pressure component could provide solutions to these small-scale problems. In this work, we investigate the possibility that present-day dark matter may result from a decaying non-cold dark matter sector transitioning into the dark energy sector. As the sensitivity of astronomical surveys rapidly increases, we explore an interacting scenario between dark energy and non-cold dark matter, where dark energy has a constant equation of state ($w_{\rm de}$), and dark matter, being non-cold, also has a constant (non-zero) equation of state ($w_{\rm dm}$). Considering the phantom and quintessence nature of dark energy, characterized by its equation of state, we separately analyze interacting phantom and interacting quintessence scenarios. We constrain these scenarios using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements and their combination with external probes, such as DESI-BAO and PantheonPlus. From our analyses, we find that a very mild preference for non-cold dark matter cannot be excluded based on the employed datasets. Additionally, for some datasets, there is a pronounced preference for the presence of an interaction at more than 95\% confidence level (CL). Moreover, when the dark energy equation of state lies in the phantom regime, the $S_8$ tension can be alleviated. This study suggests that cosmological models incorporating a non-cold dark matter component should be considered as viable scenarios with novel phenomenological implications, as reflected in the present work.</p>

<p>Light weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), whose masses are in the sub-GeV scale, have been attracting more attention due to the negative results searching for traditional WIMPs. The light WIMPs are expected to produce gamma rays from annihilation in the MeV energy region. Advancements in technology have opened up possibilities to precisely detect MeV gamma rays, leading to the upcoming space-based mission of the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). We comprehensively and quantitatively study the phenomenology of light WIMPs to determine if the COSI observations will probe their viable model parameter regions. We first construct models to describe light WIMPs based on the minimality and renormalizability of quantum field theory. Next, we impose various constraints on the models obtained from cosmological observations (CMB, BBN) and dark matter searches (accelerator, underground, astrophysical experiments, etc.). Finally, we identify viable parameter regions in each model and discuss whether or not COSI will be sensitive to the parameter regions. We find that a velocity-dependent annihilation cross-section is predicted in some regions, enabling COSI to detect the dark matter signal while avoiding severe constraints from cosmological observations.</p>

<p>Previous studies, based on precise modeling of a gravitationally lensing image, have identified what may be a extremely compact, dark perturber in the well-known lensing system SDSSJ0946+1006 (the “Jackpot”). Its remarkable compactness challenges the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. In this paper, we explore whether such a compact perturber could be explained as a core-collapsed halo described by the self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model. Using the isothermal Jeans method, we compute the density profiles of core-collapsed halos across a range of masses. Our comparison with observations indicates that only a core-collapsed halo with a total mass of approximately $10^{11}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ could produce an inner density profile and mass enclosed within 1 kpc that is consistent with observational data. However, such a massive dark matter halo should host a galaxy detectable by prior Hubble imaging, which is not observed. Thus, the core-collapsed SIDM halo model struggles to fully account for the exotic nature of the “little dark dot” in the “Jackpot” lens.</p>

<p>We present two approaches for “painting” baryonic properties relevant to the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SZ) effect - optical depth and Compton-$y$ - onto 3-dimensional $N$-body simulations, using the MillenniumTNG suite as a benchmark. The goal of these methods is to produce fast and accurate reconstruction methods to aid future analyses of baryonic feedback using the SZ effect. The first approach employs a Gaussian Process emulator to model the SZ quantities via a transfer function, while the second utilizes Hybrid Effective Field Theory (HEFT) to reproduce these quantities within the simulation. Our analysis involves comparing both methods to the true MillenniumTNG optical depth and Compton-$y$ fields using several metrics, including the cross-correlation coefficient, power spectrum, and power spectrum error. Additionally, we assess how well the reconstructed fields correlate with dark matter haloes across various mass thresholds. The results indicate that the transfer function method yields more accurate reconstructions for fields with initially high correlations ($r \approx 1$), such as between the optical depth and dark matter fields. Conversely, the HEFT-based approach proves more effective in enhancing correlations for fields with weaker initial correlations ($r \sim 0.5$), such as between the Compton-$y$ and dark matter fields. Lastly, we discuss extensions of our methods to improve the reconstruction performance at the field level.</p>

<p>The census of stellar streams and dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way provides direct constraints on galaxy formation models and the nature of dark matter. The DESI Milky Way survey (with a footprint of 14,000$~deg{^2}$ and a depth of $r&lt;19$ mag) delivers the largest sample of distant metal-poor stars compared to previous optical fiber-fed spectroscopic surveys. This makes DESI an ideal survey to search for previously undetected streams and dwarf galaxies. We present a detailed characterization of the Cocytos stream, which was re-discovered using a clustering analysis with a catalog of giants in the DESI year 3 data, supplemented with Magellan/MagE spectroscopy. Our analysis reveals a relatively metal-rich ([Fe/H]$=-1.3$) and thick stream (width$=1.5^\circ$) at a heliocentric distance of $\approx 25$ kpc, with an internal velocity dispersion of 6.5-9 km s$^{-1}$. The stream’s metallicity, radial orbit, and proximity to the Virgo stellar overdensities suggest that it is most likely a disrupted globular cluster that came in with the Gaia-Enceladus merger. We also confirm its association with the Pyxis globular cluster. Our result showcases the ability of wide-field spectroscopic surveys to kinematically discover faint disrupted dwarfs and clusters, enabling constraints on the dark matter distribution in the Milky Way.</p>

<p>We carry out a numerical calculation of magnetar-powered shock break-outs (SBOs) and supernova (SN) light-curves. In particular, we investigate the impact of gravitational wave (GW) emission by the magnetar central engine on its electromagnetic (EM) counterparts in the ULTRASAT band. Our results show that GW emission by the magnetar has only a minor effect on the SBO light-curve. However, we find that SN light-curves can carry a direct signature of GW emission, which becomes more evident at late times (&gt; 20-30 days).~Our results demonstrate that future ULTRASAT observations will provide crucial insights into the magnetar formation process, and unique information for direct searches of long-transient signals with current and future generation GW detectors. In particular, we estimate a rate of multi-messenger (UV+GW) detections of newly formed magnetars $&gt;$ 1 every two years with ULTRASAT and the Einstein Telescope.</p>

<p>Supernova 2023ixf is a type IIP supernova that was observed in May 2023 in the spiral galaxy Messier 101. This was the closest supernova observed of the decade, making this an exciting discovery. Combining the observed brightness and duration with theoretical scaling relations, we model the lightcurve of this supernova in order to reveal the properties of the progenitor star at the time of explosion, including its mass, radius, and explosion energy. We simulate these explosions using the stellar evolution and radiation-hydrodynamics codes MESA+STELLA. We find that SN2023ixf is not easily explained with “normal” stellar evolution, and only models with a small mass of H-rich ejecta can fit the lightcurve. We also find that the late time properties of the lightcurve are better fit by a higher initial-mass star with substantial mass loss during its lifetime, as compared to models with lower initial mass and less mass loss.</p>

<p>The IRAS Vela Shell (IVS) is a structure of enhanced FIR emission located towards the Gum Nebula, a prominent region of $\rm H\alpha$ emission in the local Milky Way shaped by various galactic stellar feedback over the past several million years. We constrain the 3D spatial geometry of the IVS using a parsec-resolution 3D dust map and contextualize it within the broader Gum Nebula. Our analysis reveals a dense, bowl-like IVS structure below the Galactic plane, with a more diffuse component above. We obtain a total shell mass of $5.1_{-2.4}^{+2.4}\times 10^{4}\;\rm M_{\odot}$ and, incorporating previous studies on shell expansion, a momentum of $6.0_{-3.4}^{+4.7}\times 10^{5}\;\rm M_{\odot}\;km\; s^{-1}$. We find a spatial correlation between the morphology of the dust-traced IVS and the Gum Nebula’s $\rm H\alpha$ emission when projected onto the sky. We quantify contributions of feedback from stellar winds, an expanding HII region, and supernovae to the IVS formation, finding that stellar winds are subdominant. Our momentum analysis shows that both an HII region and supernova feedback could drive the shell’s expansion. Using astrometric constraints from Gaia and Hipparcos, we trace back nearby feedback sources and find that the massive stars $\gamma2$ Velorum and $\zeta$ Puppis are currently within the IVS, producing enough ionizing luminosity to form an HII region of comparable size. Alternatively, if the IVS’ momentum is primarily driven by supernovae, $1-2$ events would be required. We also identify several young massive clusters that could have hosted supernovae within the past 3 Myr.</p>

<p>Observations of several gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that are temporally and spatially compatible with energetic supernovae (hypernovae) has established their common origin. In one case (GRB 111209A/SN 2011kl) the associated supernova was classified as superluminous (SN 2011kl). The exceptional duration of the observed gamma-ray prompt emission of GRB 111209A (about 7 hours) is widely considered key to unlocking the physics behind the still mysterious origin of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). We review the main observational and theoretical findings that may link some ultra-long GRBs to SLSNe. Specifically, we examine notable events, the role of progenitors and host galaxies in shaping these phenomena, and focus on the proposed models. While a magnetar central engine is a plausible mechanism for both luminous and long-duration GRBs, a conclusive answer remains elusive, as alternative explanations are still viable. Further observational and theoretical work is required to clarify progenitor pathways and explosion mechanisms, potentially extending the classical GRB-SN connection to rare superluminous hypernovae.</p>

<p>Modified cosmology based on Barrow entropy arises from the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, in which the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is replaced by the Barrow entropy of quantum-gravitational origin, characterized by the Barrow parameter $\Delta$. Interestingly, this framework exhibits similarities with cosmology based on Tsallis $\delta$-entropy, which, although rooted in a non-extensive generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, features the same power-law deformation of the holographic scaling present in the Barrow case. We use observational data from Supernova Type Ia (SNIa), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), and Baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), including the recently released DESI DR2 data, in order to extract constraints on such scenarios. As we show, the best-fit value for the Barrow exponent $\Delta$ is found to be negative, while the zero value, which corresponds to $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, is allowed only in the range of $2\sigma $ for three out of four datasets. Additionally, for the case of the SN$_{0}$+OHD+BAO dataset, for the current Hubble function we obtain a value of $H_0= 72.2_{-0.9}^{+0.9}$, which offers an alleviation for the $H_0$ tension. Finally, by applying information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayes evidence, we compare the fitting efficiency of the scenario at hand with $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, showing that the latter is slightly favoured.</p>

With a diameter of ~8 pc, this SNR shows a radio ring-like morphology with three bright regions toward the north, east, and south. Its linear polarisation is prominent with average values of 5 +- 1% and 6 +- 1% at 5500 and 9000 MHz, and we find a spectral index of -0.62 +- 0.02 , typical of a young SNR. The average rotation measure is estimated at -124 +- 83 rad m-2 and the magnetic field strength at ~11 muG. We also estimate an equipartition magnetic field of 72 +- 5 muG and minimum explosion energy of Emin = 2.6x1048 erg. Finally, we identified an H I cloud that may be associated with MC SNR J0519-6902, located in the southeastern part of the remnant, along with a potential wind-bubble cavity.</p>
