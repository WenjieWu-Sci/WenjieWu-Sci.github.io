<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Advancements in Streamlining Time-Domain and Multi-Messenger Astronomy Follow-Up Infrastructure at Keck Observatory</strong>, Chien-Hsiu Lee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01500v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01500v1</a></p>

<p>With active time-domain surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility, the anticipated Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and multi-messenger experiments such as LIGO/VIRGO/KANGRA for gravitational wave detection and IceCube for high-energy neutrino events, there is a new era in both time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy. The Astro2020 decadal survey highlights effectively responding to these astronomical alerts in a timely manner as a priority, and thus, there is an urgent need for the development of a seamless follow-up infrastructure at existing facilities that are capable of following up on detections at the survey depths. At the W. M. Keck Observatory (WMKO), we are actively constructing critical infrastructure, aimed at facilitating the Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) trigger, optimizing observational planning, streamlining data acquisition, and enhancing data product accessibility. In this document, we provide an overview of these developing services and place them in context of existing observatory infrastructure like the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) and Data Services Initiative (DSI).</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Convection and the Core $g$-mode in Proto-Compact Stars – A detailed analysis</strong>, Pia Jakobus et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01449v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01449v1</a></p>

<p>We present a detailed analysis of the dynamics of proto-compact star (PCS) convection and the core ${}^2!g_1$-mode in core-collapse supernovae based on general relativistic 2D and 3D neutrino hydrodynamics simulations. Based on 2D simulations, we derive a mode relation for the core $g$-mode frequency in terms of PCS and equation of state parameters, and discuss its limits of accuracy. This relation may prove useful for parameter inference from future supernova gravitational wave (GW) signals if the core $g$-mode or an emission gap at the avoided crossing with the fundamental mode can be detected. The current 3D simulation does not show GW emission from the core $g$-mode due to less power in high-frequency convective motions to excite the mode, however. Analysing the dynamics of PCS convection in 3D, we find that simple scaling laws for convective velocity from mixing-length theory (MLT) do not apply. Energy and lepton number transport is instead governed by a more complex balance between neutrino fluxes and turbulent fluxes that results in roughly uniform rates of change of entropy and lepton number in the PCS convection zone. Electron fraction and enthalpy contrasts in PCS convection are not well captured by the MLT gradient approximation. We find distinctly different spectra for the turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent fluctuations in the electron fraction, which scale approximately as $l^{-1}$ without a downturn at low $l$. We suggest that the different turbulence spectrum of the electron fraction is naturally expected for a passive scalar quantity.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>New upper bound of muon neutrino mass in a short-baseline experiment</strong>, A. M. Attia et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01416v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01416v1</a></p>

<p>In the paper Int.J.Mod.Phys.E 23 (2014) 1450004, the potential of short-baseline experiments was proposed to measure the mass (and parameters of Lorentz-violating effects) of the muon neutrino, where a roughly estimated upper bound of 420 eV was given as a possibility with large unknown uncertainties. In the present work, we improve upon this study by focusing on a feasible and improved experimental setup with today’s technology, eliminating most large uncertainties, with the use of the Geant4 simulation toolkit. High-energy protons collide with a tungsten target, producing a variety of particles, most importantly pions that decay into muon neutrinos. The detector records the time of flight for both muon and anti-muon neutrinos, utilizing light as a reference signal. Additionally, it captures the energy deposited by neutrinos. By applying the dispersion relation, we determine the muon and/or anti-muon neutrino mass. Our improved results reveal a less optimistic but more accurate and realistic estimated upper bound of the muon neutrino mass, providing a new limit of about 150 keV. Notably, this finding is a factor of three lower than the best upper bound previously established in the literature originating from pion decay in flight.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Cutting corners: Hypersphere sampling as a new standard for cosmological emulators</strong>, Andreas Nygaard et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01396v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01396v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmological emulators of observables such as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectra and matter power spectra commonly use training data sampled from a Latin hypercube. This method often incurs high computational costs by covering less relevant parts of the parameter space, especially in high dimensions where only a small fraction of the parameter space yields a significant likelihood.   In this paper, we introduce hypersphere sampling, which instead concentrates sample points in regions with higher likelihoods, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of emulators. A novel algorithm for sampling within a high-dimensional hyperellipsoid aligned with axes of correlation in the cosmological parameters is presented. This method focuses the distribution of training data points on areas of the parameter space that are most relevant to the models being tested, thereby avoiding the computational redundancies common in Latin hypercube approaches.   Comparative analysis using the \textsc{connect} emulation tool demonstrates that hypersphere sampling can achieve similar or improved emulation precision with more than an order of magnitude fewer data points and thus less computational effort than traditional methods. This was tested for both the $\Lambda$CDM model and a 5-parameter extension including Early Dark Energy, massive neutrinos, and additional ultra-relativistic degrees of freedom. Our results suggest that hypersphere sampling holds potential as a more efficient approach for cosmological emulation, particularly suitable for complex, high-dimensional models.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>The science and technology of liquid argon detectors</strong>, W. M. Bonivento et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01153v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01153v1</a></p>

<p>Liquid argon detectors are ubiquitous in particle, astroparticle, and applied physics. They reached an unprecedented level of maturity thanks to more than 20 years of R&amp;D and the operation of large-scale facilities at CERN, Fermilab, and the Gran Sasso laboratories. This article reviews such an impressive advance - from the grounding of the experimental technique up to cutting-edge applications. We commence the review by describing the physical and chemical properties of liquid argon as an active and target medium for particle detection, together with advantages and limitations compared with other liquefied noble gases. We examine the opportunities and challenges of liquid argon detectors operated as calorimeters, scintillators, and time projection chambers. We then delve into the core applications of liquid argon detectors at colliders (ATLAS), accelerator neutrino beams (SBN, DUNE), and underground laboratories (DarkSide, DEAP, ICARUS) for the observation of rare events. We complete the review by looking at unconventional developments (pixelization, combined light-charge readout, Xe-doped devices, all-optical readout) and applications in medical and applied physics to extend this technology’s scope toward novel research fields.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Development of a Bi-solvent Liquid Scintillator with Slow Light Emission</strong>, Hans Th. J. Steiger et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01100v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01100v1</a></p>

<p>One of the most promising approaches for the next generation of neutrino experiments is the realization of large hybrid Cherenkov/scintillation detectors made possible by recent innovations in photodetection technology and liquid scintillator chemistry. The development of a potentially suitable future detector liquid with particularly slow light emission is discussed in the present publication. This cocktail is compared with respect to its fundamental characteristics (scintillation efficiency, transparency, and time profile of light emission) with liquid scintillators currently used in large-scale neutrino detectors. In addition, the optimization of the admixture of wavelength shifters for a scintillator with particularly high light emission is presented. Furthermore, the pulse-shape discrimination capabilities of the novel medium was studied using a pulsed particle accelerator driven neutron source. Beyond that, purification methods based on column chromatography and fractional vacuum distillation for the co-solvent DIN (Diisopropylnaphthalene) are discussed.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Approaching the conformal limit of quark matter with different chemical potentials</strong>, Connor Brown et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01032v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01032v1</a></p>

<p>We study in detail the influence of different chemical potentials (baryon, charged, strange, and neutrino) on how and how fast a free gas of quarks in the zero-temperature limit reaches the conformal limit. We discuss the influence of non-zero masses, the inclusion of leptons, and different constraints, such as charge neutrality, zero-net strangeness, and fixed lepton fraction. We also investigate for the first time how the symmetry energy of the system under some of these conditions approaches the conformal limit. Finally, we briefly discuss what kind of corrections are expected from perturbative QCD as one goes away from the conformal limit.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>Right-handed neutrino dark matter in $U(1)_X$SSM</strong>, Ming-Yue Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00961v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.00961v1</a></p>

<p>There is strong evidence for the existence of dark matter in a number of current experiments. We study dark matter using the $U(1)_X$SSM obtained from the $U(1)_X$ extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). In the $U(1)_X$SSM, we use the right-handed neutrino as a dark matter candidate, whose lightest mass eigenstate has cold dark matter features. In this paper, the relic density of right-handed neutrino as dark matter is investigated. For dark matter scattering, both spin-independent and spin-dependent cross sections are studied. In the final numerical results obtained, some parameter spaces can satisfy the constraints of the relic density and dark matter direct detection experiments.</p>

<p>2024-05-01, <strong>Properties of Charge Recombination in Liquid Argon</strong>, Ettore Segreto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00905v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.00905v1</a></p>

<p>Liquid argon is an excellent medium for detecting particles, given its yields and transport properties of light and charge. The technology of liquid argon time projection chambers has reached its full maturity after four decades of continuous developments and is, or will be, used in world class experiments for neutrino and dark matter searches. The collection of ionization charge in these detectors allows to perform a complete tridimensional reconstruction of the tracks of charged particles, calorimetric measurements, particle identification. This work proposes a novel approach to the problem of charge recombination in liquid argon which moves from a microscopic model and is applied to the cases of low energy electrons, alpha particles and nuclear recoils. The model is able to describe precisely several sets of experimental data available in the literature, over wide ranges of electric field strengths and kinetic energies and can be easily extended to other particles.</p>

<p>2024-05-01, <strong>No $ν$s is Good News</strong>, Nathaniel Craig et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00836v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.00836v1</a></p>

<p>The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) analysis from the first year of data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), when combined with data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), has placed an upper-limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $\sum m_\nu &lt; 70$ meV (95%). In addition to excluding the minimum sum associated with the inverted hierarchy, the posterior is peaked at $\sum m_\nu = 0$ and is close to excluding even the minumum sum, 58 meV at 2$\sigma$. In this paper, we explore the implications of this data for cosmology and particle physics. The sum of neutrino mass is determined in cosmology from the suppression of clustering in the late universe. Allowing the clustering to be enhanced, we extended the DESI analysis to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0$ and find $\sum m_\nu = - 160 \pm 90$ meV (68%), and that the suppression of power from the minimum sum of neutrino masses is excluded at 99% confidence. We show this preference for negative masses makes it challenging to explain the result by a shift of cosmic parameters, such as the optical depth or matter density. We then show how a result of $\sum m_\nu =0$ could arise from new physics in the neutrino sector, including decay, cooling, and/or time-dependent masses. These models are consistent with current observations but imply new physics that is accessible in a wide range of experiments. In addition, we discuss how an apparent signal with $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0$ can arise from new long range forces in the dark sector or from a primordial trispectrum that resembles the signal of CMB lensing.</p>

<p>2024-05-01, <strong>Could SBND-PRISM probe Lepton Flavor Violation?</strong>, Gustavo F. S. Alves et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00777v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.00777v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the possibility of using the Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) at Fermilab to constrain lepton flavor violating decays of pions and kaons. We study how to leverage SBND-PRISM, the use of the neutrino beam angular spread to mitigate systematic uncertainties, to enhance this analysis. We show that SBND-PRISM can put stringent limits on the flavor violating branching ratios $\rm{BR}(\pi^+ \to \mu^+ \nu_e) = 8.9 \times 10^{-4}$, $\rm{BR}(K^+ \to \mu^+ \nu_e) = 3.2 \times 10^{-3}$, improving previous constraints by factors 9 and 1.25, respectively. We also estimate the SBND-PRISM sensitivity to lepton number violating decays, $\rm{BR}(\pi^+ \to \mu^+ \overline{\nu}_e)= 2.1 \times 10^{-3}$ and $\rm{BR}(K^+ \to \mu^+ \overline{\nu}_e) = 7.4 \times 10^{-3}$, though not reaching previous BEBC limits. Last, we identify several ways how the SBND collaboration could improve this analysis.</p>

<p>2024-05-01, <strong>Simple fits for the neutrino luminosities from protoneutron star cooling</strong>, Giuseppe Lucente et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00769v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.00769v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a simple fit function, $L_{\nu_i}(t) = C\, t^{-\alpha}\, e^{-(t/\tau)^{n}}$, to parametrize the luminosities of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors during the protoneutron star (PNS) cooling phase at post-bounce times $t \gtrsim 1$ s. This fit is based on results from a set of neutrino-hydrodynamics simulations of core-collapse supernovae in spherical symmetry. The simulations were performed with an energy-dependent transport for six neutrino species and took into account the effects of convection and muons in the dense and hot PNS interior. We provide values of the fit parameters $C$, $\alpha$, $\tau$, and $n$ for different neutron star masses and equations of state as well as correlations between these fit parameters. Our functional description is useful for analytic supernova modeling, for characterizing the neutrino light curves in large underground neutrino detectors, and as a tool to extract information from measured signals on the mass and equation of state of the PNS and on secondary signal components on top of the PNS’s neutrino emission.</p>

<p>2024-05-01, <strong>Tomography of flavoured leptogenesis with primordial blue gravitational waves</strong>, Marco Chianese et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00641v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.00641v1</a></p>

<p>We explore a scenario where an early epoch of matter domination is driven by the mass scale $M_N$ of the right-handed neutrinos, which also characterizes the different flavour regimes of leptogenesis. Such a matter-domination epoch gives rise to peculiar spectral imprints on primordial Gravitational Waves (GWs) produced during inflation. We point out that the characteristic spectral features are detectable in multiple frequency bands with current and future GW experiments in case of Blue GWs (BGWs) described by a power-law with a positive spectral index $(n_T &gt;0)$ and an amplitude compatible with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements. We find that the three-flavour leptogenesis regime with $M_N \lesssim 10^9~{\rm GeV}$ imprints BGWs more prominently than the two-flavour and one-flavour regimes characterized by a higher right-neutrino mass scale. In particular, a two-flavour (three-flavour) leptogenesis regime is expected to leave distinct imprints in the mHz ($\mu$Hz) band. Moreover, we translate the current Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and LIGO limits on the GW energy density into constraints on the flavour leptogenesis parameter space for different GW spectral index $n_T$. Interestingly, a three-flavour leptogenesis regime can offer a unique signal testable in the next LIGO run with a correlated signature in the PTA frequency band with an amplitude comparable to the one expected from supermassive black holes.</p>

<p>2024-05-01, <strong>Search for charged lepton flavor violation in $J/ψ$ decays at BESIII</strong>, Xudong Yu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00272v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.00272v1</a></p>

<p>In the Standard Model, charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) is heavily suppressed by tiny neutrino mass, while many theoretical models can enhance CLFV effects up to detectable level. The observation of any CLFV process would be a clear signal of new physics beyond SM. BESIII experiment collected 10 billion $J/\psi$ data and searched for CLFV processes $J/\psi\to e\tau$ and $e\mu$. The upper limits at the 90% confidence level are determined to be $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi\to e\tau)&lt;7.5\times 10^{-8}$ and $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi\to e\mu)&lt;4.5\times 10^{-9}$, respectively. Improving the previously experimental limits by two orders of magnitudes, the results are the most stringent CLFV searches in heavy quarkonium system.</p>

<p>2024-05-02, <strong>The Effect of a Dark Matter Core on the Structure of a Rotating Neutron Star</strong>, Andreas Konstantinou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01487v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.01487v1</a></p>

<p>Neutron stars represent unique laboratories, offering insights into the physics of supranuclear-density matter and serving as potential hosts for dark matter. This study explores the impact of dark matter cores on rapidly rotating neutron stars through the two-fluid approximation, assuming minimal interaction between baryonic matter and dark matter. The investigation employs phenomenological models for fermionic and bosonic dark matter, revealing that universal relations governing mass and radius changes due to rotation remain largely unaffected in the presence of a dark matter core. Specifically, for a 5 % dark matter mass fraction, the percent deviations in total mass ($M_{tot}$), the baryonic equatorial radius ($R_{Be}$), and polar-to-equatorial baryonic radius ratio ($R_{ratioB}$) are within 3.9 %, 1.8 %, and 1.4 %, respectively. These findings suggest that the universal relations governing neutron star shape can be utilized to infer constraints on the properties of dark matter cores even in cases where the dark matter significantly softens the neutron star’s equation of state.</p>

<p>We study LHC searches for an extension of the Standard Model (SM) by exploiting an additional Abelian $U_D(1)$ gauge symmetry and a complex scalar Higgs portal. As the scalar is charged under this gauge symmetry, a vector dark matter (VDM) candidate can satisfy the observed relic abundance and limits from direct dark matter (DM) searches. The ATLAS and CMS experiments have developed a broad search program for the DM candidates, including associate production of Higgs boson, Z boson and top quark which couple to DM. In this paper, we perform an extensive analysis to constrain the model by using these experiments at LHC. It can be seen that the LHC results can exclude some parts of the parameter space which are still allowed by relic density and the direct detection searches. Furthermore, exclusion limits on the parameter space of the model by using the new results of CMS and ATLAS collaborations for new light Higgs boson with mass $\sim95~\rm GeV$ are provided.</p>

<p>We report a methodology to determine the quality factor ($Q$) in implementations of the so-called dielectric haloscope, a new concept of wavy dark matter detector equipped with a multilayered resonator. An anechoic chamber enables the observation of the resonance frequency and its amplitude for an unlimited series of layers for the first time, which is conveniently filtered. The frequency-normalized power enhancement measured in a Dark-photons \&amp; Axion-Like particles Interferometer (DALI) prototype is a few hundred per layer over a sweep bandwidth of half a hundred MHz. In light of this result, this scaled-down prototype is sensitive to axions saturating the local dark matter density with a coupling to photons between $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ and $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim$ few $\times 10^{-14}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at frequencies of several dozens of GHz once cooled down to the different working temperatures of the experiment and immersed in magnetic fields ranging from 1 T to 10 T; while the sensitivity of the full-scale DALI is projected at $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim\mathrm{few}\times10^{-15}$ GeV$^{-1}$ over the entire 25–250 {\mu}eV range since $Q\gtrsim10^4$ is expected.</p>

<p>Euclid is a recently launched medium-class mission by the European Space Agency (ESA) designed to measure cosmological parameters, test the cosmological standard model, and explore the nature of dark matter and dark energy. To this end, Euclid conducts a survey of up to 14000 square degrees of the extra-galactic sky and obtains optical and near-infrared photometric measurements for more than a billion galaxies as well as near-infrared slitless spectroscopy for more than 35 million galaxies. These observations will be used to estimate galaxy clustering and cosmic shear. It is expected that Euclid will achieve percent-level constraints on the Dark Energy equation of state parameter. The survey will also be exploited with a range of other cosmological probes and prove revolutionary for non-cosmological science.</p>

<p>Continuous wavelet analysis is gaining popularity in science and engineering for its ability to analyze data across spatial and scale domain simultaneously. In this study, we introduce a wavelet-based method to identify halos and assess its feasibility in two-dimensional (2D) scenarios. We begin with the generation of four pseudo-2D datasets from the SIMBA dark matter simulation by compressing thin slices of three-dimensional (3D) data into 2D. We then calculate the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) directly from the particle distributions, identify local maxima that represent actual halos, and segment the CWT to delineate halo boundaries. A comparison with the traditional Friends-of-Friends (FOF) method shows that our CWT-identified halos, while containing slightly fewer particles, have smoother boundaries and are more compact in dense regions. In contrast, the CWT method can link particles over greater distances to form halos in sparse regions due to its spatial segmentation scheme. The spatial distribution and halo power spectrum of both CWT and FOF halos demonstrate substantial consistency, validating the 2D applicability of CWT for halo detection. Our identification scheme operates with a linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, suggesting its suitability for analyzing significantly larger datasets in the future.</p>

<p>At present, the Standard Model (SM) agrees with almost all collider data. Yet, three finetuning issues – the Higgs mass problem, the strong CP problem and the cosmological constant problem – all call for new physics. The most plausible solutions at present are weak scale SUSY, the PQWW axion and the string landscape. A re-evaluation of EW finetuning in SUSY allows for a higgsino-like LSP and naturalness upper bounds well beyond LHC limits. Rather general arguments from string theory allow for statistical predictions that m_h~ 125 GeV with sparticles beyond present LHC limits. The most lucrative LHC search channel may be for light higgsino pair production. Dark matter turns out to be a SUSY DFSZ axion along with a diminished abundance of higgsino-like WIMPs.</p>

<p>If the cosmological dark matter (DM) couples to Standard Model (SM) fields, it can decay promptly to SM states in a highly energetic hard process, which subsequently showers and hadronizes to give stable particles including $e^\pm$, $\gamma$, $p^{\pm}$ and $\nu\bar{\nu}$ at lower energy. If the DM particle is very heavy, the high-energy $e^\pm$, due to the Klein-Nishina cross section suppression, preferentially lose energy via synchrotron emission which, in turn, can be of unusually high energies. Here, we present novel bounds on heavy decaying DM up to the Planck scale, by studying the synchrotron emission from the $e^\pm$ produced in the ambient Galactic magnetic field. In particular, we explore the sensitivity of the resulting constraints on the DM decay width to (i) different SM decay channels, to (ii) the Galactic magnetic field configurations, and (iii) to various different DM density profiles proposed in the literature. We find that constraints from the synchrotron component complement and improve on constraints from very high-energy cosmic-ray and gamma-ray observatories targeting the prompt emission when the DM is sufficiently massive, most significantly for masses in excess of $10^{12}\text{ GeV}$.</p>

<p>We introduce the DREAMS project, an innovative approach to understanding the astrophysical implications of alternative dark matter models and their effects on galaxy formation and evolution. The DREAMS project will ultimately comprise thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that simultaneously vary over dark matter physics, astrophysics, and cosmology in modeling a range of systems – from galaxy clusters to ultra-faint satellites. Such extensive simulation suites can provide adequate training sets for machine-learning-based analyses. This paper introduces two new cosmological hydrodynamical suites of Warm Dark Matter, each comprised of 1024 simulations generated using the Arepo code. One suite consists of uniform-box simulations covering a $(25~h^{-1}~{\rm M}_\odot)^3$ volume, while the other consists of Milky Way zoom-ins with sufficient resolution to capture the properties of classical satellites. For each simulation, the Warm Dark Matter particle mass is varied along with the initial density field and several parameters controlling the strength of baryonic feedback within the IllustrisTNG model. We provide two examples, separately utilizing emulators and Convolutional Neural Networks, to demonstrate how such simulation suites can be used to disentangle the effects of dark matter and baryonic physics on galactic properties. The DREAMS project can be extended further to include different dark matter models, galaxy formation physics, and astrophysical targets. In this way, it will provide an unparalleled opportunity to characterize uncertainties on predictions for small-scale observables, leading to robust predictions for testing the particle physics nature of dark matter on these scales.</p>

LensMC, weak lensing cosmic shear measurement with forward modelling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling</strong>, Euclid Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00669v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.00669v1</a></p>

<p>LensMC is a weak lensing shear measurement method developed for Euclid and Stage-IV surveys. It is based on forward modelling to deal with convolution by a point spread function with comparable size to many galaxies; sampling the posterior distribution of galaxy parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo; and marginalisation over nuisance parameters for each of the 1.5 billion galaxies observed by Euclid. The scientific performance is quantified through high-fidelity images based on the Euclid Flagship simulations and emulation of the Euclid VIS images; realistic clustering with a mean surface number density of 250 arcmin$^{-2}$ ($I_{\rm E}&lt;29.5$) for galaxies, and 6 arcmin$^{-2}$ ($I_{\rm E}&lt;26$) for stars; and a diffraction-limited chromatic point spread function with a full width at half maximum of $0.^{!\prime\prime}2$ and spatial variation across the field of view. Objects are measured with a density of 90 arcmin$^{-2}$ ($I_{\rm E}&lt;26.5$) in 4500 deg$^2$. The total shear bias is broken down into measurement (our main focus here) and selection effects (which will be addressed elsewhere). We find: measurement multiplicative and additive biases of $m_1=(-3.6\pm0.2)\times10^{-3}$, $m_2=(-4.3\pm0.2)\times10^{-3}$, $c_1=(-1.78\pm0.03)\times10^{-4}$, $c_2=(0.09\pm0.03)\times10^{-4}$; a large detection bias with a multiplicative component of $1.2\times10^{-2}$ and an additive component of $-3\times10^{-4}$; and a measurement PSF leakage of $\alpha_1=(-9\pm3)\times10^{-4}$ and $\alpha_2=(2\pm3)\times10^{-4}$. When model bias is suppressed, the obtained measurement biases are close to Euclid requirement and largely dominated by undetected faint galaxies ($-5\times10^{-3}$). Although significant, model bias will be straightforward to calibrate given the weak sensitivity.</p>

<p>Bias models relating the dark matter field to the spatial distribution of halos are widely used in cosmological analyses. Many such models predict halos purely from the local matter density, an assumption which has not been verified in a model-agnostic setting. Bias models in perturbation theory require the inclusion of other local properties, but it is not clear whether this extends to non-perturbative approaches. We assess the validity of the assumption that only the local dark matter density can be used to predict the number density of halos in a model-independent way and in the non-perturbative regime. Utilising $N$-body simulations, we introduce a test wherein we study the properties of the halo counts field after spatial voxels with near-equal dark matter density have been permuted. If local-in-matter-density (LIMD) biasing were valid, the statistical properties of the permuted and un-permuted fields would be indistinguishable since both are equally fair draws of the stochastic biasing model. For voxels of side length $\sim4-60\,h^{-1}{\rm\,Mpc}$ and for halos less massive than $\sim10^{15}\,h^{-1}{\rm\,M_\odot}$, the permuted halo field has significantly too much power on large scales compared to the truth. We interpret this as due to LIMD models removing small-scale power by not modelling correlations between neighbouring voxels. Since the permutation conserves the total variance of the halo counts field, large-scale power is substantially boosted to compensate. This conclusion is robust to the choice of initial conditions and cosmology. LIMD halo biasing cannot, therefore, reproduce the distribution of halos across a large range of scales and halo masses, no matter how complex the model. To reproduce this distribution accurately, one must allow the biasing to be a function of other quantities and/or remove the assumption that neighbouring voxels are statistically independent.</p>

<p>The Hubble constant, $H_0$, tension is the tension among the local probes, Supernovae Ia, and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. It has been almost a decade, and this tension still puzzles the community. Here, we add intermediate redshift probes, such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) and Quasars (QS0s), to check if and to what extent these higher redshift probes can reduce this tension. We use the three-dimensional fundamental plane relation among the prompt peak luminosity, the luminosity at the end of the plateau emission, and its rest frame duration. We find similar trend in GRB intrinsic parameters as previously seen in Pantheon-Plus intrinsic parameters. We find an apparent $3.14\sigma$ tension for the GRB intrinsic parameter $b$. Indeed, this tension disappears and the parameters are actually compatible within $2.26\sigma$. Another interesting point is that the 3D relation plays an important role in conjunction with Supernovae data with Pantheon Plus and that this apparent discrepancy show how it is important the correction for selection biases and redshift evolution. The incorporation of redshift evolution correction results in a reduction of the GRB tension to $2.26\sigma$ when adjusting correction parameters. We envision that with more data this indication of tension will possibly disappear when the evolutionary parameters of GRBs are computed with increased precision.</p>

<p>The granulation of red supergiants (RSGs) in the Magellanic Clouds are systematically investigated by combining the latest RSGs samples and light curves from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment and the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae. The present RSGs samples are firstly examined for foreground stars and possible misidentified sources, and the light curves are sequentially checked to remove the outliers by white noise and photometric quality. The Gaussian Process regression is used to model the granulation, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo is applied to derive the granulation amplitude $\sigma$ and the period of the undamped oscillator $\rho$, as well as the damping timescale $\tau$. The dimensionless quality factor $Q$ is then calculated through $Q=\pi \tau/\rho$. RSGs around $Q = 1/\sqrt{2}$ are considered to have significant granulation signals and are used for further analysis. Combining granulation parameters with stellar parameters, robust scaling relations for the timescale $\rho$ are established, while the scaling relations for amplitude $\sigma$ are represented by a piecewise function, possibly related to the tendency of amplitudes in faint RSGs to converge towards a certain value. Comparing results between the SMC and LMC confirms that amplitudes and timescales become larger with metallicity. In examining the scaling relations between the two galaxies, it is found that $\rho$ is nearly independent of metallicity, whereas $\sigma$ is more significantly affected by metallicity. The Gaussian Process method is compared with the periodogram fitting of the granulations, and the advantages of either are discussed.</p>

<p>Nova shocks behave like scaled-down supernova remnant shocks with a lifetime of only a few weeks or months, thereby providing a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of non-relativistic shocks as well as the shock acceleration physics.Recently, GeV and TeV gamma-ray emissions from an outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi have been observed. The light curves of the gamma-ray emissions suggest that they arise from an external shock, which is formed as the nova ejecta interacts with the ambient medium. The shock is thought to transit from an adiabatic shock to a radiative one at later times, but no such later observations are available for RS Ophiuchi. In addition, the spectral evolution of the gamma-ray outburst of RS Ophiuchi was not well measured, and hence the related particle acceleration mechanisms are not well understood. T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is another recurrent nova in Milky Way and its last outburst was nearly ten times brighter than RS Ophiuichi. Recently the optical light curve of T CrB displayed a state transition behavior before the eruption, and it was predicted that T CrB will undergo an outburst in the near future. By performing a theoretical investigation, we find that Fermi-LAT could capture the transition of the shock from the adiabatic phase to the radiative phase at the GeV band, thanks to a longer detectable time than that of RS Ophiuchi.Due to its higher brightness, we also find that imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) such as MAGIC and VERITAS, and extensive air shower experiments such as LHAASO could detect the nova outburst and measure the gamma-ray spectrum in the very-high-energy (VHE, energy above 0.1 TeV) band more precisely. This can be used to constrain the high-energy cutoff index in the accelerated proton spectrum and the acceleration efficiency, which will shed light on the particle acceleration physics in nova shocks.</p>

<p>Wolf-Rayet stars in close binary systems can be tidally spun up by their companions, potentially leaving behind fast-spinning highly-magnetized neutron stars, known as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">magnetars", after core collapse. These newborn magnetars can transfer rotational energy into heating and accelerating the ejecta, producing hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). In this {\em{Letter}}, we propose that the magnetar wind of the newborn magnetar could significantly evaporate its companion star, typically a main-sequence or helium star, if the binary system is not disrupted by the SN kick. The subsequent heating and acceleration of the evaporated star material along with the SN ejecta by the magnetar wind can produce a post-peak bump in the SLSN lightcurve. Our model can reproduce the primary peaks and post-peak bumps of four example observed multiband SLSN lightcurves, revealing that the mass of the evaporated material could be $\sim0.4-0.6\,M\_\odot$ if the material is hydrogen-rich. We suggest that the magnetar could induce strongly enhanced evaporation from its companion star near the pericenter if the orbit of the post-SN binary is highly eccentric, ultimately generating multiple post-peak bumps in the SLSN lightcurves. This</code>magnetar-star binary engine” model offers a possible explanation for the evolution of polarization, along with the origin and velocity broadening of late-time hydrogen or helium broad spectral features observed in some bumpy SLSNe. The diversity in the lightcurves and spectra of SLSNe may be attributed to the wide variety of companion stars and post-SN binary systems.</p>

<p>We present determinations of the gas-phase and stellar metallicities of a sample of 65 star-forming galaxies at $z \simeq 3.5$ using rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectroscopy from the VANDELS survey in combination with follow-up rest-frame optical spectroscopy from VLT/KMOS and Keck/MOSFIRE. We infer gas-phase oxygen abundances ($Z_{\mathrm{g}}$; tracing O/H) via strong optical nebular lines and stellar iron abundances ($Z_{\star}$; tracing Fe/H) from full spectral fitting to the FUV continuum. Our sample spans the stellar mass range $8.5 &lt; \mathrm{log}(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) &lt; 10.5$ and shows clear evidence for both a stellar and gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR). We find that our O and Fe abundance estimates both exhibit a similar mass-dependence, such that $\mathrm{Fe/H}\propto M_{\star}^{0.30\pm0.11}$ and $\mathrm{O/H}\propto M_{\star}^{0.32\pm0.09}$. At fixed $M_{\star}$ we find that, relative to their solar values, O abundances are systematically larger than Fe abundances (i.e., $\alpha$-enhancement).We estimate an average enhancement of $\mathrm{(O/Fe)} = 2.65 \pm 0.16 \times \mathrm{(O/Fe)_\odot}$ which appears to be independent of $M_{\star}$. We employ analytic chemical evolution models to place a novel constraint on the strength of galactic-level outflows via the mass-outflow factor ($\eta$). We show that outflow efficiencies that scale as $\eta \propto M_{\star}^{-0.32}$ can simultaneously explain the functional form of of the stellar and gas-phase MZR, as well as the degree of $\alpha$-enhancement at fixed Fe/H. Our results add further evidence to support a picture in which $\alpha$-enhanced abundance ratios are ubiquitous in high-redshift star-forming galaxies, as expected for young systems whose interstellar medium is primarily enriched by core-collapse supernovae.</p>

The $f(T)$ cosmological models considered are characterised by power law late-time accelerated expansion. Our results show that the combination DESI BAO +$r_d$ CMB Planck suggests a Bayesian preference for late-time $f(T)$ cosmological models over $\Lambda$CDM, obtaining a value of $H_0=72.4\pm 2.9$[km/s/Mpc] in agreement with SH0ES collaboration.</p>

<p>We investigate the X-ray properties of a large sample of 71 broad line and narrow line AGN at 2&lt;z&lt;11 discovered by JWST in the GOODS fields, which have the deepest Chandra observations ever obtained. Despite the widespread presence of AGN signatures in their rest-optical and -UV spectra, the vast majority of them is X-ray undetected. The stacked X-ray data of the non-detected sources also results in a non-detection. The upper limit on the X-ray emission for many of these AGN is one or even two orders of magnitude lower than expected from a standard AGN SED. Heavy X-ray absorption by clouds with large (Compton thick) column density and low dust content, such as the Broad Line Region (BLR) clouds, can explain the X-ray weakness. In this scenario the BLR covering factor should be much larger than in low-z AGN or luminous quasar; this is supported by the larger equivalent width of the broad component of Halpha in JWST-selected AGN. We also find that the JWST-discovered AGN lack the prominent, fast outflows characterizing low-z AGN and luminous quasars, suggesting that, in JWST-selected AGN, dense gas lingers in the nuclear region, resulting in large covering factors. We also note that a large fraction of JWST-selected AGN match the definition of NLSy1, typically characterized by a steep X-ray spectrum, and this can further contribute to their observed weakness at high-z. Finally, we discuss that the broad Balmer lines used to identify type 1 AGN cannot be ascribed to Very Massive Stars, Tidal Disruption Events, or Supernovae, although we show that a minority of the faintest broad lines could potentially be associated with the echo of superluminous SNe or TDE. Scenarios in which the broad lines are ascribed to galactic outflows are also untenable. We emphasize that confirming any of the scenarios discussed above will require X-ray missions more sensitive than Chandra. (abridged)</p>

<p>We use a combination of Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data and non-CMB data that include Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$], growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, and a collection of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, but not recent DESI 2024 BAO measurements, to confirm the DESI 2024 (DESI+CMB+PantheonPlus) data compilation support for dynamical dark energy with an evolving equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$. From our joint compilation of CMB and non-CMB data, in a spatially-flat cosmological model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.850 \pm 0.059$ and $w_a = -0.59^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$ and find that this dynamical dark energy is favored over a cosmological constant by $\sim 2\sigma$. Our data constraints on the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model are slightly more restrictive than the DESI 2024 constraints, with the DESI 2024 and our values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ differing by $-0.27\sigma$ and $0.44\sigma$, respectively. Our data compilation slightly more strongly favors the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model than does the DESI 2024 data compilation.</p>

<p>Ion Weibel instability is considered to be the dominant physics for the dissipation in high-Mach number astrophysical shocks such as supernova remnant shocks and gamma-ray burst shocks. We study the instability dependence on various parameters using theory and particle-in-cell simulations. We demonstrate that electron physics determines the saturation level of the Weibel-generated magnetic field, even though the instability is driven by the ions. We discuss the application to astrophysical and laboratory laser experiment environments to clarify the roles of the ion Weibel instability. We develop a model for the isotropization length scale in Weibel-mediated shocks and compare its value to other characteristic length scales of each system. We find that electron heating to near equipartition is crucial for the formation of ultra-relativistic Weibel-mediated shocks. On the other hand, our results imply that non-relativistic shocks in typical interstellar medium are not purely mediated by the Weibel instability.</p>

<p>The tight relationship between infrared luminosity (L$_\mathrm{TIR}$) and 1.4 GHz radio continuum luminosity (L$_\mathrm{1.4GHz}$) has proven useful for understanding star formation free from dust obscuration. Infrared emission in star-forming galaxies typically arises from recently formed, dust-enshrouded stars, whereas radio synchrotron emission is expected from subsequent supernovae. By leveraging the wealth of ancillary far-ultraviolet - far-infrared photometry from the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) and Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) surveys, combined with 1.4 GHz observations from the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) survey and Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) projects, we investigate the impact of timescale differences between far-ultraviolet - far-infrared and radio-derived star formation rate (SFR) tracers. We examine how the SED-derived star formation histories (SFH) of galaxies can be used to explain discrepancies in these SFR tracers, which are sensitive to different timescales. Galaxies exhibiting an increasing SFH have systematically higher L$_\mathrm{TIR}$ and SED-derived SFRs than predicted from their 1.4 GHz radio luminosity. This indicates that insufficient time has passed for subsequent supernovae-driven radio emission to accumulate. We show that backtracking the SFR(t) of galaxies along their SED-derived SFHs to a time several hundred megayears prior to their observed epoch will both linearise the SFR-L$_\mathrm{1.4GHz}$ relation and reduce the overall scatter. The minimum scatter in the SFR(t)-L$_\mathrm{1.4GHz}$ is reached at 200 - 300 Myr prior, consistent with theoretical predictions for the timescales required to disperse the cosmic ray electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission.</p>
