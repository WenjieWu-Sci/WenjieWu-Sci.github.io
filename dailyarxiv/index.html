<p>2025-04-23, <strong>Dispu$τ$able: the high cost of a low optical depth</strong>, Noah Sailer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16932v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.16932v1</a></p>

<p>Recent Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) are mildly discrepant ($2.2\sigma$) with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) when interpreted within $\Lambda$CDM. When analyzing these data with extended cosmologies this inconsistency manifests as a $\simeq3\sigma$ preference for sub-minimal neutrino mass or evolving dark energy. It is known that the preference for sub-minimal neutrino mass from the suppression of structure growth could be alleviated by increasing the optical depth to reionization $\tau$. We show that, because the CMB-inferred $\tau$ is negatively correlated with the matter fraction, a larger optical depth resolves a similar preference from geometric constraints. Optical depths large enough to resolve the neutrino mass tension ($\tau\sim0.09)$ also reduce the preference for evolving dark energy from $\simeq3\sigma$ to $\simeq1.5\sigma$. Conversely, within $\Lambda$CDM the combination of DESI BAO, high-$\ell$ CMB and CMB lensing yields $\tau = 0.090 \pm 0.012$. The required increase in $\tau$ is in $\simeq3-5\sigma$ tension with Planck low-$\ell$ polarization data when taken at face value. While there is no evidence for systematics in the large-scale Planck data, $\tau$ remains the least well-constrained $\Lambda$CDM parameter and is far from its cosmic variance limit. The importance of $\tau$ for several cosmological measurements strengthens the case for future large-scale CMB experiments as well as direct probes of the epoch of reionization.</p>

<p>2025-04-23, <strong>Particles in finite volumes and a toy model of decaying neutrons</strong>, Christian Käding et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16784v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.16784v1</a></p>

<p>It is well-known that the momentum spectra of particles confined to finite spatial volumes deviate from the continuous spectra used for unconfined particles. In this article, we consider real scalar particles confined to finite volumes with periodic boundary conditions, such that the particles’ spectra are discrete. We directly compute the density matrices describing the decay processes $\phi \to \varphi^2$ and $\phi \to \varphi\chi\nu$, and subsequently derive expressions for the decay probabilities both for confined and unconfined particles. The latter decay process is used as a rough toy model for a neutron decaying into a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron neutrino. We propose that finite volume effects can have an impact on the outcomes of experiments measuring the neutron lifetime. In addition, our findings at the toy model level suggest that taking into account possible initial correlations between neutrons and their daughter particles might be relevant as well.</p>

<p>2025-04-23, <strong>Testing the Gallium anomaly using Electron-Neutrino Scattering</strong>, Emilio Ciuffoli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16590v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.16590v1</a></p>

<p>The Gallium anomaly is an unexplained deficit in the neutrinos observed during the calibration of GALLEX and SAGE using a $^{51}$Cr radioactive source and recently confirmed by BEST. The possible explanations for this deficit include an overestimation of the neutrino absorption cross section in Ga, an incorrect measurement of the source activity or the existence of sterile neutrinos. However, as this deficit has only been observed in Ga detectors, it has not been possible to distinguish among various proposals. Therefore, we propose an experiment using the same radioactive source but with a different detection method, electron-neutrino scattering. We discuss potential locations for such an experiment, estimating the main backgrounds and expected event rates, considering various target masses and source positions. Even if the anomaly does not result from the detection method, such an experiment can provide an independent determination of the branching ratio of the $^{51}$Cr decay by using the spectral information or observing the scattering angle. It is also sensitive to an eventual baseline dependence of the anomaly, as is predicted in sterile neutrino models.</p>

<p>2025-04-23, <strong>Energy Rates Due to Weak Decay Rates of Vanadium Isotopes in Stellar Environment</strong>, Ramoona Shehzadi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16428v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.16428v1</a></p>

<p>The neutrino cooling and gamma heating rates are considered as an important input needed to study the final phases of the evolution of high-mass stars. The weak-interaction mediated processes, namely the $\beta$-decay and electron capture, significantly change the lepton to baryon ratio and accelerate the contraction of the core. The emission of resulting neutrinos/antineutrinos tends to cool the stellar core. On the other hand, gamma rays are produced because of electron capture and $\beta$-decay to excited states in daughter nuclei. These gamma rays heat the core and contribute to an increase of entropy which may cause convection to occur.   In the present work, the weak-interaction heating and cooling rates on a chain of twenty-two isotopes of vanadium having mass in the range $43-64$ have been estimated using the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation theory. The rates have been computed for the temperature ranging from ($10^{7} - 3 \times 10^{10}$)\;K and for the density range ($10-10^{11}$)\;g/cm$^{3}$. Our calculated neutrino energy loss rates have also been compared with the previously reported rates calculated using other theoretical models. At high stellar temperatures, our rates are larger by 1-2 orders of magnitude as compared to previous results.</p>

<p>2025-04-23, <strong>Self-interacting dark matter with observable $ΔN_{\rm eff}$</strong>, Debasish Borah et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16910v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.16910v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a GeV-scale self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) candidate within a dark $U(1)_D$ gauged extension of the Standard Model (SM), addressing small-scale structure issues in $\Lambda$CDM while predicting an observable contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ in the form of dark radiation. The model introduces a fermionic DM candidate $\chi$ and a scalar $\phi$, both charged under an unbroken $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry. The self-interactions of $\chi$ are mediated by a light vector boson $X^\mu$, whose mass is generated via the Stueckelberg mechanism. The relic abundance of $\chi$ is determined by thermal freeze-out through annihilations into $X^\mu$, supplemented by a non-thermal component from the late decay of $\phi$. Crucially, $\phi$ decays after the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) but before the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) epoch, producing additional $\chi$ and a dark radiation species ($\nu_S$). This late-time production compensates for thermal underabundance due to efficient annihilation into light mediators, while remaining consistent with structure formation constraints. The accompanying dark radiation yields a detectable $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, compatible with Planck 2018 bounds and within reach of next-generation experiments such as SPT-3G, CMB-S4, and CMB-HD.</p>

<p>2025-04-23, <strong>Characterization of a GAGG detector for neutron measurements in underground laboratories</strong>, Lorenzo Ascenzo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16889v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.16889v1</a></p>

<p>In rare events experiments, such as those devoted to the direct search of dark matter, a precise knowledge of the environmental gamma and neutron backgrounds is crucial for reaching the design experiment sensitivity. The neutron component is often poorly known due to the lack of a scalable detector technology for the precise measurement of low-flux neutron spectra. Gd$_3$Al$_2$Ga$_3$O$_{12}$ (GAGG) is a newly developed, high-density scintillating crystal with a high gadolinium content, which could allow to exploit the high $(n,\gamma)$ cross section of $^{155}$Gd and $^{157}$Gd for neutron measurements in underground environments. GAGG crystals feature a high scintillation light yield, good timing performance, and the capability of particle identification via pulse-shape discrimination. In a low-background environment, the distinctive signature produced by neutron capture on gadolinium, namely a $\beta/\gamma$ cascade releasing up to 9 MeV of total energy, and the efficient particle identification provided by GAGG could yield a background-free neutron capture signal. In this work, we present the characterization of a first GAGG detector prototype in terms of particle discrimination performance, intrinsic radioactive contamination, and neutron response.</p>

<p>2025-04-23, <strong>Detecting Cosmological Phase Transitions with Taiji: Sensitivity Analysis and Parameter Estimation</strong>, Fan Huang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16712v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.16712v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the capability of the Taiji space-based gravitational wave observatory to detect stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds produced by first-order phase transitions in the early universe. Using a comprehensive simulation framework that incorporates realistic instrumental noise, galactic double white dwarf confusion noise, and extragalactic compact binary backgrounds, we systematically analyze Taiji’s sensitivity across a range of signal parameters. Our Bayesian analysis demonstrates that Taiji can robustly detect and characterize phase transition signals with energy densities exceeding $\Omega_{\text{PT}} \gtrsim 1.4 \times 10^{-11}$ across most of its frequency band, with particularly strong sensitivity around $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ Hz. For signals with amplitudes above $\Omega_{\text{PT}} \gtrsim 1.1 \times 10^{-10}$, Taiji can determine the peak frequency with relative precision better than $10\%$. These detection capabilities would enable Taiji to probe electroweak-scale phase transitions in various beyond-Standard-Model scenarios, potentially revealing new physics connected to baryogenesis and dark matter production. We quantify detection confidence using both Bayes factors and the Deviance Information Criterion, finding consistent results that validate our statistical methodology.</p>

<p>2025-04-23, <strong>Gravitational Positivity Bounds on Higgs-Portal Dark Matter</strong>, Kimiko Yamashita et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16525v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.16525v1</a></p>

<p>We consider gravitational positivity bounds on the Higgs-portal scalar dark matter model. Applying gravitational positivity bounds with dark matter forward scattering process $\phi \phi \to \phi \phi$ to this DM model, we find that the new physics, besides the Higgs-portal dark matter physics, arises at an energy scale lower than $10^{10}$ GeV without the dark matter self-coupling. With the existence of the dark matter self-coupling, the hierarchical order of magnitude between the self-coupling $\lambda_{\phi}$ and the Higgs-portal coupling $\lambda_{h\phi}$ changes the game. With $\lambda_{\phi}/\lambda_{h\phi} = 10^{12}$, the GUT scale cutoff can realize. In this case, the dark freezeout scenario is possible for realizing the relic density of dark matter in the Universe. We find that $\lambda_{\phi} \sim O(1)$, $\lambda_{h\phi} \sim 10^{-12}$, and sub-GeV dark matter is implicated for the GUT scale cutoff possibility with the Higgs-portal dark matter model.</p>

<p>2025-04-23, <strong>Supermassive Binaries in Ultralight Dark Matter Solitons</strong>, Russell Boey et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16348v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.16348v1</a></p>

<p>Ultralight (or fuzzy) dark matter (ULDM) is an alternative to cold dark matter. A key feature of ULDM is the presence of solitonic cores at the centers of collapsed halos. These would potentially increase the drag experienced by supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, changing their merger dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave background. We perform detailed simulations of high-mass SMBH binaries in the soliton of a massive halo. We find more rapid decay than previous simulations and semi-analytic approximations. We confirm expectations that the drag depends strongly on the ULDM particle mass, finding masses greater than $10^{-21}$ eV could potentially alleviate the final parsec problem and that ULDM may even suppress gravitational wave production at lower frequencies in the pulsar timing band.</p>

<p>2025-04-23, <strong>Thawing quintessence and transient cosmic acceleration in light of DESI</strong>, Rayff de Souza et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16337v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.16337v1</a></p>

<p>Recent analysis of the DESI Collaboration challenges the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, suggesting evidence for a dynamic dark energy. These results are obtained in the context of generic parameterizations of the dark energy equation of state (EoS), which better fit the data when they exhibit an unphysical phantom behavior in the past. In this paper, we briefly analyze how ambiguous this latter conclusion can be in light of the background degeneracy between EoS parameterizations and minimally coupled quintessence scenarios. We then investigate whether the current observational data can be accommodated with a non-phantom, thawing dark energy EoS, typical of a broad class of quintessence models. We show that the thawing behavior of this EoS outperforms the CPL parameterization and is statistically competitive with $\Lambda$CDM while predicting cosmic acceleration as a transient phenomenon. Such a dynamic behavior aligns with theoretical arguments from string theory and offers a way out of the trans-Planckian problem that challenges the ever-accelerated $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</p>

<p>2025-04-23, <strong>Hint towards inconsistency between BAO and Supernovae Dataset: The Evidence of Redshift Evolving Dark Energy from DESI DR2 is Absent</strong>, Samsuzzaman Afroz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16868v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.16868v1</a></p>

<p>The combination of independent cosmological datasets is a route towards precision and accurate inference of the cosmological parameters if these observations are not contaminated by systematic effects. However, the presence of unknown systematics present in differrent datasets can lead to a biased inference of the cosmological parameters. In this work, we test the consistency of the two independent tracers of the low-redshift cosmic expansion, namely the supernovae dataset from Pantheon$+$ and the BAO dataset from DESI DR2 using the distance duality relation which is a cornerstone relation in cosmology under the framework of General Relativity. We find that these datasets violate the distance duality relation and show a signature of redshift evolution, hinting toward unaccounted physical effects or observational artifacts. Coincidentally this effect mimics a redshift evolving dark energy scenario when supernovae dataset and DESI datasets are combined without accounting for this inconsistency. Accounting for this effect in the likelihood refutes the previous claim of evidence of non-cosmological constant as dark energy model from DESI DR2, and shows a result consistent with cosmological constant with $w_0= -0.92\pm 0.08$ and $w_a= -0.49^{+0.33}_{-0.36}$. This indicates that the current conclusion from DESI DR2 in combination with Pantheon$+$ is likely due to the combination of two inconsistent datasets resulting in precise but inaccurate inference of cosmological parameters. In the future, tests of this kind for the consistency between different cosmological datasets will be essential for robust inference of cosmological parameters and for deciphering unaccounted physical effects or observational artifacts from supernovae and BAO datasets.</p>

<p>2025-04-23, <strong>An accreting dwarf star orbiting the S-type giant star pi1 Gru</strong>, M. Montargès et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16845v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.16845v1</a></p>

<p>Aims. We aim to characterize the properties of the inner companion of the S-type AGB star pi1 Gru, and to identify plausible future evolution scenarios for this triple system. Methods. We observed pi1 Gru with ALMA and VLT/SPHERE. In addition, we collected archival photometry data and used the Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomaly. We derive the best orbital parameters from Bayesian inference. Results. The inner companion, pi1 Gru C was located at 37.4 +/- 2.0 mas from the primary in June-July 2019 (projected separation of 6.05 +/- 0.55 au at 161.7 +/- 11.7 pc). The best orbital solution gives a companion mass of 0.86 (+0.22/-0.20) Msun (using the derived mass of the primary), and a semi-major axis of 7.05 (+0.54/-0.57) au. This leads to an orbital period of 11.0 (+1.7/-1.5) yr. The best solution is an elliptical orbit with eccentricity e = 0.35 (+0.18/-0.17), but a circular orbit cannot be totally excluded. The close companion can either be a K1V (F9.5V/K7V) star or a white dwarf. The ultraviolet and millimeter continuum photometry are consistent with the presence of an accretion disk around the close companion. The ultraviolet emission could then either originate in hot spots in an overall cooler disk, or also from a hot disk in case the companion is a white dwarf. Conclusions. Though the close companion and the AGB star are interacting, and an accretion disk is observed around the companion, the mass-accretion rate is too low to cause a Ia supernova but could produce novae every ~900 yr. Short wavelength spatially resolved observations are needed to further constrain the nature of the C companion. Searches for close-in companions similar to this system will help to better understand the physics of mass- and angular-momentum transfer, and orbital evolution in the late evolutionary stages.</p>

<p>2025-04-23, <strong>Symbiotic stars in the era of modern ground- and space-based surveys</strong>, Jaroslav Merc et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16825v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.16825v1</a></p>

<p>Symbiotic stars, interacting binaries composed of a cool giant and a hot compact companion, exhibit complex variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. Over the past decades, large-scale photometric and spectroscopic surveys from ground- and space-based observatories have significantly advanced their discovery and characterization. These datasets have transformed the search for new symbiotic candidates, providing extensive time-domain information crucial for their classification and analysis. This review highlights recent observational results that have expanded the known population of symbiotic stars, refined classification criteria, and enhanced our understanding of their variability. Despite these advances, fundamental questions remain regarding their long-term evolution, mass transfer and accretion processes, or their potential role as progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. With ongoing and upcoming surveys, the coming years promise new discoveries and a more comprehensive picture of these intriguing interacting systems.</p>
