<p>2023-08-09, <strong>Search for Dark Matter Decay in Nearby Galaxy Clusters and Galaxies with IceCube</strong>, Minjin Jeong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04833v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.04833v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter could decay into Standard Model particles producing neutrinos directly or indirectly. The resulting flux of neutrinos from these decays could be detectable at neutrino telescopes and would be associated with massive celestial objects where dark matter is expected to be accumulated. Recent observations of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos at IceCube might hint at a signal produced by the decay of TeV to PeV scale dark matter. This analysis searches for neutrinos from decaying dark matter in nearby galaxy clusters and galaxies. We focus on dark matter masses from 10 TeV to 1 EeV and four decay channels: $\nu\bar{\nu}$, $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$, $W^{+}W^{-}$, $b\bar{b}$. Three galaxy clusters, seven dwarf galaxies, and the Andromeda galaxy are chosen as targets and stacked within the same source class. A well-established IceCube data sample is used, which contains 11 years of upward-going track-like events. In this contribution, we present preliminary results of the analysis.</p>

<p>2023-08-08, <strong>Measurement of the Cosmic Neutrino Flux from the Southern Sky using 10 years of IceCube Starting Track Events</strong>, Manuel Silva et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04582v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.04582v1</a></p>

<p>The measurement of a diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux using starting track events marks the first time IceCube has observed and subsequently measured the astrophysical diffuse flux using a dataset composed primarily of starting track events. Starting tracks combine an excellent angular and energy resolution. This enables us to take advantage of the self-veto effect in the southern sky reducing the atmospheric neutrino rate allowing us to detect astrophysical neutrinos to energies well below 100 TeV. We measure the astrophysical flux as $\phi^{per-flavor}_{Astro}=1.68^{+0.19}_{-0.22}$(at 100 TeV) and $\gamma_{Astro} = 2.58^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ assuming a single power law flux. The astrophysical flux 90% sensitive energy range is 3 TeV to 500 TeV, extending IceCube’s reach to the low energy astrophysical flux by an order of magnitude. A brief summary of tests performed to search for neutrinos from the galactic plane using this dataset is also provided. With this sample, we did not find statistically significant evidence for emission from the galactic plane. We then tested the impact of these galactic plane neutrinos on the isotropic diffuse flux, with at most 10% effect on the overall normalization and negligible impact to the spectral index.</p>

<p>2023-08-08, <strong>Low-latency gravitational wave alert products and their performance in anticipation of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run</strong>, Sushant Sharma Chaudhary et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04545v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.04545v1</a></p>

<p>Multi-messenger searches for binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers are currently one of the most exciting areas of astronomy. The search for joint electromagnetic and neutrino counterparts to gravitational wave (GW)s has resumed with Advanced LIGO (aLIGO)’s, Advanced Virgo (AdVirgo)’s and KAGRA’s fourth observing run (O4). To support this effort, public semi-automated data products are sent in near real-time and include localization and source properties to guide complementary observations. Subsequent refinements, as and when available, are also relayed as updates. In preparation for O4, we have conducted a study using a simulated population of compact binaries and a Mock Data Challenge (MDC) in the form of a real-time replay to optimize and profile the software infrastructure and scientific deliverables. End-to-end performance was tested, including data ingestion, running online search pipelines, performing annotations, and issuing alerts to the astrophysics community. In this paper, we present an overview of the low-latency infrastructure as well as an overview of the performance of the data products to be released during O4 based on a MDC. We report on expected median latencies for the preliminary alert of full bandwidth searches (29.5 s) and for the creation of early warning triggers (-3.1 s), and show consistency and accuracy of released data products using the MDC. This paper provides a performance overview for LVK low-latency alert structure and data products using the MDC in anticipation of O4.</p>

<p>2023-08-08, <strong>Fermion mass, Axion dark matter, and Leptogenesis in SO(10) GUT</strong>, Ajay Kaladharan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04497v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.04497v1</a></p>

<p>SO(10) grand unified theory with minimum parameters in the Yukawa sector employs the Peccei-Quinn symmetry that solves the strong CP problem. Such an economical Yukawa sector is highly appealing and has been extensively studied in the literature. However, when the running of the renormalization group equations of the Yukawa couplings are considered, this scenario shows somewhat tension with the observed fermion masses and mixing. In this work, we propose an extension of the minimal framework that alleviates this tension by introducing only a few new parameters. The proposed model consists of a fermion in the fundamental and a scalar in the spinorial representations. While the latter is needed to implement the Peccei-Quinn symmetry successfully, the presence of both is essential in obtaining an excellent fit to the fermion mass spectrum. In our model, axions serve the role of dark matter, and the out-of-equilibrium decays of the right-handed neutrinos successfully generate the matter-antimatter symmetry of the Universe.</p>

<p>2023-08-08, <strong>The division between weak and strong explosions from failed supernovae</strong>, Eric R. Coughlin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04486v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.04486v1</a></p>

<p>Some massive stars likely fail to produce core-collapse supernovae, but these failed supernovae (FSNe) can generate an electromagnetic outburst prior to the disappearance of the star, as the mass lost to neutrinos during the stellar core-collapse results in the formation and breakout of a second shock. We show that when the mass lost to neutrinos is sufficiently small, there are two self-similar solutions that describe the propagation of a weak shock into a hydrodynamically expanding envelope that simultaneously yield accretion onto the black hole. The larger-Mach number solution is unstable and yields the minimum Mach number that a shock must have to strengthen into the energy-conserving regime. Above a critical mass loss there are no weak-shock solutions, implying that there are only strong explosions if the neutrino mass loss is above a critical value, and this value is a few percent of the mass of the star (and is physically achievable) for typical parameters. Our results imply that the fate of the explosion from a FSN – weak with little to no mass ejection or strong with the expulsion of the majority of the envelope – is a sensitive function of the stellar properties and the neutrino mass loss. We also show that there is a second type of self-similar solution for the shock that results in the ``settling’’ of the gas near the compact object, which may be applicable to non-terminal stellar eruptions and the response of a gaseous disc to gravitational-wave induced mass loss from a binary black hole merger.</p>

<p>2023-08-08, <strong>Cosmic ray interactions with matter and radiation</strong>, Pasquale Dario Serpico et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04361v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.04361v1</a></p>

<p>The main goal of the present lectures is to outline the key particle interactions and energy loss mechanisms in the Galactic medium that high-energy particles are subject to. These interactions are an important ingredient entering the cosmic ray propagation equation, contributing to shape cosmic ray spectra. They also source the so-called secondary species, like gamma rays, neutrinos, “fragile” nuclei not synthesised in stars, and antiparticles, all routinely used as diagnostic tools in a multi-messenger context. These lectures are complementary to Denise Boncioli’s ones, focusing instead on processes happening at ultra-high energies in the extragalactic environment. They include propaedeutic material to Felix Aharonian’s and, to some extent, Stefano Gabici’s and Carmelo Evoli’s lectures.</p>

<p>2023-08-08, <strong>A time variability test for neutrino sources identified by IceCube</strong>, Pranav Dave et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04342v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.04342v1</a></p>

<p>IceCube has reported evidence for neutrino emission from the Seyfert-II galaxy NGC 1068 and the blazar TXS 0506+056. The former was identified in a time-integrated search, and the latter using time-dependent and multi-messenger methods. A natural question is: are sources identified in time-integrated searches consistent with a steady neutrino source? We present a non-parametric method, TAUNTON, to answer this question. Motivated by the Cram'er-von Mises test, TAUNTON is an unbinned single-hypothesis method to identify deviations in neutrino data from the steady hypothesis. An advantage of TAUNTON is that it is sensitive to arbitrary deviations from the steady hypothesis. Here we present results of TAUNTON applied to a 8.7 year data-set of muon neutrino track events; the same data used to identify NGC 1068 at 4.2$\sigma$. We use TAUNTON on 51 objects, a subset (with &gt;4 signal neutrinos) of the 110 objects studied in the NGC 1068 publication. We set a threshold of 3$\sigma$ pre-trial to identify sources inconsistent with the steady hypothesis. TAUNTON reports a p-value of 0.9 for NGC 1068, consistent with the steady hypothesis. Using the time integrated fit, data for TXS 0506+056 is consistent with the steady hypothesis at 1.7$\sigma$. Time variability is not identified for TXS 0506+056 because there are few neutrino events.</p>

<p>2023-08-08, <strong>Predicting gravitational waves from jittering-jets-driven core collapse supernovae</strong>, Noam Soker et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04329v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.04329v1</a></p>

<p>I estimate the frequencies of gravitational waves from jittering jets that explode core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) to crudely be 5-30 Hz, and with strains that might allow detection of Galactic CCSNe. The jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) asserts that most CCSNe are exploded by jittering jets that the newly born neutron star (NS) launches within few seconds. According to the JJEM, instabilities in the accreted gas lead to the formation of intermittent accretion disks that launch the jittering jets. Earlier studies that did not include jets calculated the gravitational frequencies that instabilities around the NS emit to have a peak in the crude frequency range of 100-2000 Hz. Based on a recent study, I take the source of the gravitational waves of jittering jets to be the turbulent bubbles (cocoons) that the jets inflate as they interact with the outer layers of the core of the star at thousands of kilometres from the NS. The lower frequencies and larger strain than those of gravitational waves from instabilities in CCSNe allow future, and maybe present, detectors to identify the gravitational wave signals of jittering jets. Detection of gravitational waves from local CCSNe might distinguish between the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism and the JJEM.</p>

<p>2023-08-08, <strong>VLBI Probes of Jet Physics in Neutrino-Candidate Blazars</strong>, F. Eppel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04311v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.04311v1</a></p>

<p>In recent years, evidence has accumulated that some high-energy cosmic neutrinos can be associated with blazars. The strongest evidence for an individual association was found in the case of the blazar TXS 0506+056 in 2017. In July 2019, another track-like neutrino event (IC190730A) was found spatially coincident with the well-known bright flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 1502+106. PKS 1502+106 was not found to be in a particularly elevated gamma-ray state, but exhibited a remarkably bright radio outburst at the time of the neutrino detection, similar to TXS 0506+056. We have performed a multi-frequency VLBI study from 15 GHz up to 86 GHz on TXS 0506+056, PKS 1502+106 and one additional neutrino-candidate blazar (PKS 0215+015) to study the radio structure of neutrino candidate blazars in response to their neutrino association. We have obtained target of opportunity observations with the VLBA for all three sources within $\sim$1 month from their associated neutrino events and are performing multi-epoch studies of the jet kinematics at 15 GHz as part of the MOJAVE program. Here, we present first results on TXS 0506+056 at 86 GHz and one additional 43 GHz image obtained 27 days after IC170922A, closer in time to the neutrino event than previously published images. We also give an overview about our recent work on PKS 1502+106 and PKS 0215+015.</p>

<p>2023-08-08, <strong>Probing Earth’s Missing Potassium using the Unique Antimatter Signature of Geoneutrinos</strong>, LiquidO Consortium et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04154v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.04154v1</a></p>

<p>The formation of the Earth remains an epoch with mysterious puzzles extending to our still incomplete understanding of the planet’s potential origin and bulk composition. Direct confirmation of the Earth’s internal heat engine was accomplished by the successful observation of geoneutrinos originating from uranium (U) and thorium (Th) progenies, manifestations of the planet’s natural radioactivity dominated by potassium (40K) and the decay chains of uranium (238U) and thorium (232Th). This radiogenic energy output is critical to planetary dynamics and must be accurately measured for a complete understanding of the overall heat budget and thermal history of the Earth. Detecting geoneutrinos remains the only direct probe to do so and constitutes a challenging objective in modern neutrino physics. In particular, the intriguing potassium geoneutrinos have never been observed and thus far have been considered impractical to measure. We propose here a novel approach for potassium geoneutrino detection using the unique antimatter signature of antineutrinos to reduce the otherwise overwhelming backgrounds to observing this rarest signal. The proposed detection framework relies on the innovative LiquidO detection technique to enable positron (e+) identification and antineutrino interactions with ideal isotope targets identified here for the first time. We also provide the complete experimental methodology to yield the first potassium geoneutrino discovery.</p>

<p>2023-08-08, <strong>Cross Correlation of IceCube Neutrinos with Tracers of Large Scale Structure</strong>, David Guevel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03978v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.03978v1</a></p>

<p>The origin of most astrophysical neutrinos is unknown, but extragalactic neutrino sources may follow the spatial distribution of the large-scale structure of the universe. Galaxies also follow the same large scale distribution, so establishing a correlation between galaxies and IceCube neutrinos could help identify the origins of the diffuse neutrinos observed by IceCube. Following a preliminary study based on the WISE and 2MASS catalogs, we will investigate an updated galaxy catalog with improved redshift measurements and reduced stellar contamination. Our IceCube data sample consists of track-like muon neutrinos selected from the Northern sky. The excellent angular resolution of track-like events and low contamination with atmospheric muons is necessary for the sensitivity of the analysis. Unlike a point source stacking analysis, the calculation of the cross correlation does not scale with the number of entries in the catalog, making the work tractable for catalogs with millions of objects. We present the development and performance of a two-point cross correlation of IceCube neutrinos with a tracer of the large scale structure.</p>

<p>2023-08-08, <strong>Neutrinos and nucleosynthesis of elements</strong>, Tobias Fischer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03962v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.03962v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinos are known to play important roles in many astrophysical scenarios from the early period of the big bang to current stellar evolution being a unique messenger of the fusion reactions occurring in the center of our sun. In particular, neutrinos are crucial in determining the dynamics and the composition evolution in explosive events such as core-collapse supernovae and the merger of two neutron stars. In this paper, we review the current understanding of supernovae and binary neutron star mergers by focusing on the role of neutrinos therein. Several recent improvements on the theoretical modeling of neutrino interaction rates in nuclear matter as well as their impact on the heavy element nucleosynthesis in the supernova neutrino-driven wind are discussed, including the neutrino-nucleon opacity at the mean field level taking into account the relativistic kinematics of nucleons, the effect due to the nucleon-nucleon correlation, and the nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. We also review the framework used to compute the neutrino-nucleus interactions and the up-to-date yield prediction for isotopes from neutrino nucleosynthesis occurring in the outer envelope of the supernova progenitor star during the explosion. Here improved predictions of energy spectra of supernova neutrinos of all flavors have had significant impact on the nucleosynthesis yields. Rapid progresses in modeling the flavor oscillations of neutrinos in these environments, including several novel mechanisms for collective neutrino oscillations and their potential impacts on various nucleosynthesis processes are summarized.</p>

<p>2023-08-09, <strong>Confronting global 21-cm signal with $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetric dark matter models</strong>, Debarun Paul et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04955v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.04955v1</a></p>

<p>While the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetric dark matter models have shown tremendous prospects in addressing a number of (astro-)particle physics problems, they can leave interesting imprints on cosmological observations as well. We consider two such promising models: semi-annihilating dark matter (SADM) and Co-SIMP $2\rightarrow 3$ interaction, and investigate their effects on the global 21-cm signal. SADM is found to address the EDGES observation with the aid of an excess radio background, whereas Co-SIMP can explain the EDGES dip by virtue of an intrinsic cooling effect without invoking any such excess radiation. Hence, the latter model turns out to be a rare model within the domain of CDM, that uses leptophilic interaction to achieve the EDGES dip. Further, keeping in mind the ongoing debate between EDGES and SARAS 3 on the global 21-cm signal, we demonstrate that our chosen models can still remain viable in this context, even if the EDGES data requires reassessment in future. We then extend our investigation to possible reflections on the Dark Ages, followed by a consistency check with the CMB and BAO observations via Planck 2018(+BAO) datasets. This work thus presents a compelling case of exploring these interesting particle physics models in the light of different cosmological observations.</p>

<p>2023-08-08, <strong>Kerr-Newman and Electromagnetic acceleration</strong>, Paul H. Frampton et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04875v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.04875v1</a></p>

<p>Previous discussions of charged dark matter neglected PBH spin and employed the Reissner-Nordstrom metric. In Nature we expect the PBHs to possess spin which require use of the technically more challenging Kerr-Newman metric. It is shown that the use of K-N metric retains the principal properties already obtained using the R-N metric, in particular the dominance of Coulomb repulsion requires super-extremality and the presence of naked singularities. In this sense, the spin of the PBHs is not an essential complication.</p>

<p>Searches for new particles beyond the Standard Model (SM) are an important task for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this paper, we investigate the properties of the heavy non-SM Higgs bosons in the $\mu$-term extended Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model ($\mu$NMSSM). We scan the parameter space of the $\mu$NMSSM considering the basic constraints from Higgs data, dark matter (DM) relic density, and LHC searches for sparticles. And we also consider the constraints from the LZ2022 experiment and the muon anomaly constraint at 2$\sigma$ level.   We find that the LZ2022 experiment has a strict constraint on the parameter space of the $\mu$NMSSM, and the limits from the DM-nucleon spin-independent (SI) and spin-dependent (SD) cross-sections are complementary. Then we discuss the exotic decay modes of heavy Higgs bosons decaying into SM-like Higgs boson. We find that for doublet-dominated Higgs $h_3$ and $A_2$, the main exotic decay channels are $h_3\rightarrow Z A_1$, $h_3\rightarrow h_1 h_2$, $A_2\rightarrow A_1 h_1$ and $A_2\rightarrow Z h_2$, and the branching ratio can reach to about 23$\%$, 10$\%$, 35$\%$ and 10$\%$ respectively. At the 13 TeV LHC, the production cross-section of $ggF\rightarrow h_3\rightarrow h_1 h_2$ and $ggF\rightarrow A_2\rightarrow A_1 h_1$ can reach to about $10^{-11}$pb and $10^{-10}$pb, respectively.</p>

<p>2023-08-08, <strong>Bounds on Ultralight Dark Matter from NANOGrav</strong>, Mohammad Aghaie et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04590v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.04590v1</a></p>

<p>The detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background by NANOGrav imposes constraints on the mass of compact cores of ultralight dark matter, also known as “solitons”, surrounding supermassive black holes found at the centers of large galaxies. The strong dynamical friction between the rotating black holes and the solitons competes with gravitational wave emission, resulting in a suppression of the characteristic strain in the nHz frequency range. Our findings rule out solitons arising from the condensation of ultralight dark matter particles with masses ranging from $1.3\times 10^{-21}$ eV to $1.4\times 10^{-20}$ eV.</p>

<p>We study normalised solutions of the stationary Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson (GPP) equation with a defocusing local nonlinear term, \(-\Delta u+\lambda u+\|u\|^2u =(I\_\alpha*\|u\|^2)u\quad\text{in $\mathbb R^3$},\qquad\int\_{\mathbb R^3}u^2dx=\rho^2,\) where $\rho&gt;0$ is the prescribed mass of the solutions, $\lambda=\lambda_\rho\in\mathbb R$ is an a-priori unknown Lagrange multiplier, and $I_\alpha(x)=A_\alpha|x|^{3-\alpha}$ is the Riesz potential of order $\alpha\in(0,3)$. When $\alpha=2$ this problem appears in the study of self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates, which were proposed in cosmology and astrophysics to describe Cold Dark Matter and Boson Stars.   We investigate the existence of normalized solutions to the GPP equation, paying special attention to the shape and the asymptotic behaviour of the associated mass-energy relation and $\lambda_\rho$ curves and to the limit profiles of solutions at the endpoints of these curves. In particular, we show that after appropriate rescalings, the constructed normalized solutions converge either to a ground state of the Choquard equation, or to a compactly supported radial ground state of the integral Thomas-Fermi equation.</p>

<p>Einstein formulated the general theory of relativity (GR) with an aim to mathematically incorporate Mach’s principle. Despite early hopes, it became evident that GR did not follow Mach’s proposition. Nevertheless, due to its accurate explanation of various observational results, Einstein refrained from further attempts to formulate Mach’s principle. Over time, multiple researchers attempted to develop gravity theories aligned with the Machian model of inertia. However, each of these theories possessed its own strengths and weaknesses. This paper presents a novel theory of gravity that fully embraces Mach’s principle. This metric-based theory, termed as Machian Gravity (MG), can be derived from the action principle, ensuring compliance with all conservation laws. The theory demonstrates its efficacy by providing precise explanations for galactic rotation curves. Moreover, it effectively resolves the discrepancy between dynamic mass and photometric mass in galaxy clusters without resorting to dark matter. It also presents a resolution for the expansion history of the universe without requiring any dark matter and dark energy. Consequently, MG presents a viable and compelling alternative to the standard gravity theory.</p>

<p>When modeling the population of merging binary black holes, analyses generally focus on characterizing the distribution of primary (i.e. more massive) black holes in the binary, while simplistic prescriptions are used for the distribution of secondary masses. However, the secondary mass distribution provides a fundamental observational constraint on the formation history of coalescing binary black holes. If both black holes experience similar stellar evolutionary processes prior to collapse, as might be expected in dynamical formation channels, the primary and secondary mass distributions would show similar features. If they follow distinct evolutionary pathways (for example, due to binary interactions that break symmetry between the initially more massive and less massive star), their mass distributions may differ. We explicitly fit the secondary mass distribution, finding that if the primary and secondary mass distributions are different, the previously-identified peak in the primary mass distribution may be driven by an even larger peak in the secondary mass distribution. Alternatively, if we assume that the two masses are drawn from the same underlying distribution, they both show a peak at $31.4_{-2.6}^{+2.3} \, M_{\odot}$. This value is shifted lower than that obtained when assuming the peak only exists in the marginal primary mass distribution, placing this feature in further tension with expectations from a pulsational pair-instability supernova pileup. We anticipate that by the end of the fifth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run, we will be able to determine whether the data prefer distinct or identical component mass distributions to $&gt;4\sigma$, providing important clues to the formation history of coalescing binary black holes.</p>

<p>Among the diverse progenitor channels leading to Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), there are explosions originating from white dwarfs with sub-Chandrasekhar masses. These white dwarfs undergo detonation and explosion triggered by primary detonation in the helium shell, which has been accreted from a companion star. The double-detonation model predicts a correlation between the age of the progenitor system and the near peak brightness: the younger the exploding progenitors, the brighter the SNe. In this paper, we present our recent achievements on the study of SNe Ia properties in different locations within host galactic discs and the estimation of their progenitor population ages. Observationally, we confirm the validity of the anticipated correlation between the SN photometry and the age of their progenitors.</p>

<p>2023-08-09, <strong>Rayleigh and Raman scattering cross-sections and phase matrices of the ground-state hydrogen atom, and their astrophysical implications</strong>, Mitsuru Kokubo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04959v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.04959v1</a></p>

<p>We present explicit expressions for Rayleigh and Raman scattering cross-sections and phase matrices of the ground $1s$ state hydrogen atom based on the Kramers-Heisenberg dispersion formula. The Rayleigh scattering leaves the hydrogen atom in the ground-state while the Raman scattering leaves the hydrogen atom in either $ns$ ($n\geq2$; $s$-branch) or $nd$ ($n\geq3$; $d$-branch) excited state, and the Raman scattering converts incident ultraviolet (UV) photons around the Lyman resonance lines into optical-infrared (IR) photons. We show that this Raman wavelength conversion of incident flat UV continuum in dense hydrogen gas with a column density of $N_{\text{H}} &gt; 10^{21}~\text{cm}^{-2}$ can produce broad emission features centred at Balmer, Paschen, and higher-level lines, which would mimic Doppler-broadened hydrogen lines with the velocity width of $\gtrsim 1,000~\text{km}~\text{s}^{-1}$ that could be misinterpreted as signatures of Active Galactic Nuclei, supernovae, or fast stellar winds. We show that the phase matrix of the Rayleigh and Raman $s$-branch scatterings is identical to that of the Thomson scattering while the Raman $d$-branch scattering is more isotropic, thus the Paschen and higher-level Raman features are depolarized compared to the Balmer features due to the flux contribution from the Raman $d$-branch. We argue that observations of the line widths, line flux ratios, and linear polarization of multiple optical/IR hydrogen lines are crucial to discriminate between the Raman-scattered broad emission features and Doppler-broadened emission lines.</p>

<p>2023-08-09, <strong>Using 4MOST to refine the measurement of galaxy properties: A case study of Supernova hosts</strong>, J. Dumayne et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04863v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.04863v1</a></p>

<p>The Rubin Observatory’s 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time will observe near to 20 billion galaxies. For each galaxy the properties can be inferred. Approximately $10^5$ galaxies observed per year will contain Type Ia supernovae (SNe), allowing SN host-galaxy properties to be calculated on a large scale. Measuring the properties of SN host-galaxies serves two main purposes. The first is that there are known correlations between host-galaxy type and supernova type, which can be used to aid in the classification of SNe. Secondly, Type Ia SNe exhibit correlations between host-galaxy properties and the peak luminosities of the SNe, which has implications for their use as standardisable candles in cosmology. We have used simulations to quantify the improvement in host-galaxy stellar mass ($M_\ast$) measurements when supplementing photometry from Rubin with spectroscopy from the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) instrument. We provide results in the form of expected uncertainties in $M_\ast$ for galaxies with 0.1 &lt; $z$ &lt; 0.9 and 18 &lt; $r_{AB}$ &lt; 25. We show that for galaxies mag 22 and brighter, combining Rubin and 4MOST data reduces the uncertainty measurements of galaxy $M_\ast$ by more than a factor of 2 compared with Rubin data alone. This applies for elliptical and Sc type hosts. We demonstrate that the reduced uncertainties in $M_\ast$ lead to an improvement of 7\% in the precision of the “mass step” correction. We expect our improved measurements of host-galaxy properties to aid in the photometric classification of SNe observed by Rubin.</p>

<p>2023-08-09, <strong>The dusty red supergiant progenitor and the local environment of the Type II SN 2023ixf in M101</strong>, Ze-Xi Niu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04677v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2308.04677v1</a></p>

<p>As one of the closest supernovae (SNe) in the last decade, SN 2023ixf is an unprecedented target to investigate the progenitor star that exploded. However, there is still significant uncertainty in the reported progenitor properties. In this work, we present a detailed study of the progenitor of SN 2023ixf with two independent analyses. We first modelled its spectral energy distribution (SED) based on Hubble Space Telescope optical, Spitzer mid-infrared (IR), and ground-based near-IR data. We find that stellar pulsation and circumstellar extinction have great impacts on SED fitting, and the result suggests a relatively massive red supergiant (RSG) surrounded by C-rich dust with an initial mass of 16.2–17.4 Msun. The corresponding mass-loss rate estimate is 1e-5 Msun/yr. We also derived the star formation history of the SN environment based on resolved stellar populations, and the most recent star-forming epoch corresponds to a progenitor initial mass of 17–19 Msun, in agreement with that from our SED fitting. Therefore, we conclude that the progenitor of SN 2023ixf is close to the high-mass end for Type II SN progenitors.</p>
