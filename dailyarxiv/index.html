<p>2024-05-21, <strong>Impact of inhomogeneous diffusion on secondary cosmic ray and antiproton local spectra</strong>, Álvaro Tovar-Pardo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12918v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.12918v1</a></p>

<p>Recent $\gamma$-ray and neutrino observations seem to favor the consideration of non-uniform diffusion of cosmic rays (CRs) throughout the Galaxy. In this study, we investigate the consequences of spatially-dependent inhomogeneous propagation of CRs on the fluxes of secondary CRs and antiprotons detected at Earth. A comparison is made among different scenarios in search of potential features that may guide us toward favoring one over another in the near future. We also examine both the influence of inhomogeneous propagation in the production of secondary CRs from interactions with the gas, and the effects of this scenario on the local fluxes of antiprotons and light antinuclei produced as final products of dark matter annihilation. Our results indicate that the consideration of an inhomogeneous diffusion model could improve the compatibility of the predicted local antiproton flux with that of B, Be and Li, assuming only secondary origin of these particles. In addition, our model predicts a slightly harder local antiproton spectrum, making it more compatible with the high energy measurements of AMS-02. Finally, no significant changes are expected in the predicted local flux of antiprotons and antinuclei produced from dark matter among the different considered propagation scenarios.</p>

<p>Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles in the minimal extension of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. They could be viable dark matter candidates if they have a mass in the keV range. The Karlsruhe tritium neutrino (KATRIN) experiment, extended with a silicon drift detector focal plane array (TRISTAN), has the potential to search for keV-scale sterile neutrinos by measuring the kinematics of the tritium $\beta$-decay. The collaboration targets a sensitivity of $10^{-6}$ on the mixing amplitude $\sin^2{\Theta}$. For this challenging target, a precise understanding of the detector response is necessary. In this work, we report on the characterization of electron backscattering from the detector surface, which is one of the main effects that influence the shape of the observed energy spectrum. Measurements were performed with a tandem silicon drift detector system and a custom-designed electron source. The measured detector response and backscattering probability are in good agreement with dedicated backscattering simulations using the Geant4 simulation toolkit.</p>

<p>2024-05-21, <strong>Dimuons from neutrino-nucleus collisions in the semi-inclusive DIS approach</strong>, Ilkka Helenius et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12677v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.12677v1</a></p>

<p>We present a next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculation of dimuon production in neutrino-nucleus collisions. This process is typically calculated by assuming it to be proportional to inclusive charm production, which requires an effective acceptance correction to take the experimental cuts on the decay-muon kinematics into account. Here, we instead compute the dimuon production cross section directly as a convolution of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering to produce charmed hadrons, and a decay function fitted to $e^+e^-$ data to produce a muon from the charmed hadrons. The presented approach is in a good agreement with available experimental data and will serve as a starting point for higher-order QCD calculations without an external acceptance correction. The uncertainties arising from the decay function and scale dependence are sizeably smaller than those from the nuclear parton distribution functions. We also calculate the effective acceptances within our approach and compare them to those usually used in global fits of parton distribution functions, finding differences of the order of $10\,\%$, depending on the kinematics, perturbative order, and applied parton distributions.</p>

<p>2024-05-21, <strong>First joint oscillation analysis of Super-Kamiokande atmospheric and T2K accelerator neutrino data</strong>, Super-Kamiokande et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12488v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.12488v1</a></p>

<p>The Super-Kamiokande and T2K collaborations present a joint measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters from their atmospheric and beam neutrino data. It uses a common interaction model for events overlapping in neutrino energy and correlated detector systematic uncertainties between the two datasets, which are found to be compatible. Using 3244.4 days of atmospheric data and a beam exposure of $19.7(16.3) \times 10^{20}$ protons on target in (anti)neutrino mode, the analysis finds a 1.9$\sigma$ exclusion of CP-conservation (defined as $J_{CP}=0$) and a preference for the normal mass ordering.</p>

<p>2024-05-21, <strong>Cosmic rays from annihilation of heavy dark matter particles</strong>, E. V. Arbuzova et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12560v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.12560v1</a></p>

<p>The origin of the ultra high energy cosmic rays via annihilation of heavy stable, fermions “f”, of the cosmological dark matter (DM) is studied. The particles in question are supposed to be created by the scalaron decays in $R^2$ modified gravity. Novel part of our approach is the assumption that the mass of these carriers of DM is slightly below than a half of the scalaron mass. In such a case the phase space volume becomes tiny. It leads to sufficiently low probability of “f” production, so their average cosmological energy density could be equal to the observed energy density of dark matter. Several regions of the universe, where the annihilation could take place, are studied. They include the whole universe under assumption of homogeneous energy density, the high density DM clump in the galactic centre, the cloud of DM in the Galaxy with realistic density distribution, and high density clusters of DM in the Galaxy. Possible resonance annihilation of $f \bar f$ into energetic light particle is considered. We have shown that the proposed scenario can successfully explain the origin of the ultrahigh energy flux of cosmic rays where the canonical astrophysical mechanisms are not operative.</p>

<p>2024-05-21, <strong>Is Planckian discreteness observable in cosmology?</strong>, Gabriel R. Bengochea et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12534v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.12534v1</a></p>

<p>A Planck scale inflationary era – in a quantum gravity theory predicting discreteness of quantum geometry at the fundamental scale – produces the scale invariant spectrum of inhomogeneities with very small tensor-to-scalar ratio of perturbations and a hot big bang leading to a natural dark matter genesis scenario. Here we evoke the possibility that some of the major puzzles in cosmology would have an explanation rooted in quantum gravity.</p>

<h1 id="supernova-4">supernova (4)</h1>

<p>2024-05-21, <strong>Revisiting short-plateau SN 2018gj</strong>, V. P. Utrobin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12867v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.12867v1</a></p>

<p>We present an alternative model of unusual type-IIP SN 2018gj. Despite the short plateau and early gamma-rays escape seeming to favor low-mass ejecta, our hydrodynamic model requires a large ejected mass (about 23 Msun). The high ejecta velocity, we find from hydrogen lines in early spectra, is among crucial constraints on the hydrodynamic model. We recover the wind density that rules out a notable contribution of the circumstellar interaction to the bolometric luminosity. The early radioactive gamma-rays escape is found to be due to the high velocity of Ni-56, whereas the asymmetry of the H-alpha emission is attributed to the asymmetry of the Ni-56 ejecta. The available sample of type-IIP supernovae studied hydrodynamically in a uniform way indicates that the asymmetry of the Ni-56 ejecta is probably their intrinsic property. Hydrogen lines in the early spectra of SN 2018gi and SN 2020jfo are found to imply a clumpy structure of the outer ejecta. With two already known similar cases of SN 2008in and SN 2012A we speculate that the clumpiness of the outer ejecta is inherent to type-IIP supernovae related to the red supergiant explosion.</p>

<p>2024-05-21, <strong>Chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge with different stellar populations</strong>, M. Molero et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12585v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.12585v1</a></p>

<p>The metallicity distribution function (MDF) of the Galactic bulge features a multi-peak shape, with a metal-poor peak at [Fe/H]=-0.3 dex and a metal-rich peak at [Fe/H]=+0.3 dex. This bimodality is also seen in [alpha/Fe] versus [Fe/H] ratios, indicating different stellar populations in the bulge. We aim to replicate the observed MDF by proposing a scenario where the metal-poor bulge stars formed in situ during an intense star formation burst, while the metal-rich stars formed during a second burst and/or were accreted from the inner Galactic disk due to a growing bar. We used a chemical evolution model that tracks various chemical species with detailed nucleosynthesis, focusing on Fe production from both Type Ia supernovae and massive stars, including rotating massive stars with varying velocities. Our model also accounts for gas infall, outflow, and the effect of stellar migration. Results are compared to 13,000 stars from the SDSS/APOGEE survey within 3.5 kpc of the Galactic center. Our model successfully reproduces the double-peak shape of the bulge MDF and the alpha-element abundance trends relative to Fe by assuming (i) a multi-burst star formation history with a 250 Myr quenching of the first burst and (ii) stellar migration from the inner disk due to a growing bar. We estimate that about 40% of the bulge-bar’s stellar mass originates from the inner disk. Nucleosynthesis models that assume either no rotation for massive stars or a rotational velocity distribution favoring slow rotation at high metallicities best match the observed MDF and [alpha/Fe] and [Ce/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance patterns.</p>

<p>2024-05-21, <strong>SN 2019tua : A Type IIb Supernova with Multiple Bumps in the Light Curves</strong>, Xin-Bo Huang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12504v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.12504v1</a></p>

<p>We present photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis of the type IIb supernova (SN) SN 2019tua, which exhibits multiple bumps in its declining light curves between 40 and 65 days after discovery. SN 2019tua shows a time to peak of about 25 days similar to other type IIb SNe. Our observations indicate a decrease in its brightness of about 1 magnitude in the 60 days after the peak. At about days 50, and 60, its multiband light curves exhibit bumpy behavior. The complex luminosity evolution of SN 2019tua could not be well modeled with a single currently popular energy source model, e.g., radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni, magnetar, interaction between the ejecta and a circumstellar shell. Even though the magnetar model has a smaller ( \chi^2 / \text{dof} ) value, the complex changes in SN 2019tua’s brightness suggest that more than one physical process might be involved. We propose a hybrid CSM interaction plus $^{56}$Ni model to explain the bolometric light curve (LC) of SN 2019tua. The fitting results show that the ejecta mass $M_{\rm ej} \approx 2.4~M_\odot$, the total CSM mass $M_{\rm CSM} \approx 1.0~M_\odot$, and the $^{56}$Ni mass $M_{\rm Ni} \approx 0.4~M_\odot$. The total kinetic energy of the ejecta is $E_k\approx 0.5 \times 10^{51}\rm~erg$. Pre-existing multiple shells suggest that the progenitor of SN 2019tua experienced mass ejections within approximately $\sim6 - 44$ years prior to the explosion.</p>

<p>2024-05-21, <strong>Model independent calibration for sound horizon combining observations of supernovae and transversal BAO measurements</strong>, Tonghua Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12498v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.12498v1</a></p>

<p>The sound horizon is a key theoretical prediction of the cosmological model that depends on the speed of sound and the rate of expansion in the early universe, before matter and radiation decoupled. The standard ruler for low redshift calibration of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) is a direct measurement that would exist even if the standard cosmological model and the standard assumptions of early physics did not. We propose a new model-independent method to calibrate sound horizon $r^h_s$ (relative standard ruler) by using the latest observations of SNe Ia and transversal BAO measurements. The final result reports $r_s^{h}=107.10^{+1.36}_{-1.32}$ $Mpc/h$ in the framework of the Pantheon dataset. This result changes to $r_s^{h}=105.63^{+1.33}_{-1.31}$ $Mpc/h$ when uses Pantheon+ dataset. Note that even without an estimate of dimensionless Hubble constant $h$, the combination of BAO and SNe Ia datasets already constrain the low-redshift standard ruler scale $r_s^{h}$ at the $\sim1.26\%$ level. More importantly, it is interesting to find that most of the $r_s^{h}$ obtained at high redshifts have a larger value (9 out of 15 results are larger than the result obtained by combining all BAOs). This finding may give us a better understanding of the discordance between the data sets or Hubble tension or reveal new physics beyond the standard model.</p>
