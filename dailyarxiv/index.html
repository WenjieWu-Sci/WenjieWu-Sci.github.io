<p>2024-06-27, <strong>Probing self-interacting ultra-high-energy neutrinos with cosmic 21-cm signal</strong>, Mansi Dhuria et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19279v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.19279v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, we investigate the constraints on secret self-interactions of neutrinos by examining the impact of radiative scattering of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos. These neutrinos are produced from the decay of superheavy dark matter and interact with the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B). We explore how these interactions influence the 21-cm hydrogen signal during the cosmic dark ages and cosmic dawn, periods relatively free from astrophysical uncertainties, providing a clearer signal for studying non-standard neutrino interactions. By analyzing the global brightness temperature measurements, we constrain the scattering cross-section of UHE self-interacting neutrinos, determining the coupling constant $g$ to be within $\sim 10^{-4}$ to $\sim 10^{-3}$ for neutrino energies in the PeV to EeV range. Interestingly, these constraints are more competitive than those from existing astrophysical and collider experiments. As future 21-cm experiments focus on measuring brightness temperature across a wide range of redshifts from the cosmic dark ages to reionization, using the epoch of 21-cm to probe neutrino properties could provide crucial insights into dark matter and neutrino physics.</p>

<p>2024-06-27, <strong>Loop-induced masses for the first two generations with optimum flavour violation</strong>, Gurucharan Mohanta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19179v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.19179v1</a></p>

<p>A mechanism for the masses of third, second, and first generation charged fermions at the tree, 1-loop, and 2-loop levels, respectively, is proposed. The fermionic self-energy corrections that lead to this arrangement are induced through heavy vector bosons of a new gauged flavour symmetry group $G_F$. It is shown that a single Abelian group suffices as $G_F$. Moreover, the gauge charges are optimized to result in relatively smaller flavour violations in processes involving the first and second generation fermions. The scheme is explicitly implemented on the Standard Model fermions in an anomaly-free manner and is shown to be viable with observed charged fermion masses and quark mixings. Constraints from flavour violations dictate the lower limit on the new physics scale in these types of frameworks. Through optimal flavour violation, it is shown that nearly two orders of magnitude improvement can be achieved on the lower limit, leading to the new physics scale $\ge 10^3$ TeV in this case. Further improvements are possible at the cost of the down quark mass deviating more than $3 \sigma$ from its value extracted from lattice calculations. Options for inducing tiny masses for light neutrinos are also discussed.</p>

<p>2024-06-27, <strong>Laboratory constraint on the electric charge of the neutron and the neutrino</strong>, Savely G. Karshenboim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19129v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.19129v1</a></p>

<p>We revisit constraints on the electric charge of the neutron and neutrino as well as on e_p+e_e. We consider phenomenological constraints based on laboratory study of the electrical neutrality of subatomic, atomic, and molecular species under assumption of the conservation of the electric charge in the beta decay, that relates e_p+e_e, e_n, and e_nu. Some previously published constraints utilized an additional assumption e_nu=0, which we do not. We dismiss a cosmological constraint at the level of 10^-35 e utilized by PDG in their Review of particle properties as a controversial one which makes the laboratory constraints on e_nu dominant.   The phenomenological constraints from the laboratory experiments are obtained as e_p+e_e=(0.2\pm2.6)10^-21 e, e_n=(-0.4\pm1.1)10^-21 e, and e_nu=(0.6\pm3.2)10^{-21} e. The ones on e_p+e_e and e_n are at the same level as the PDG constraints, while our e_nu constraint is several orders of magnitude weaker than the controversial cosmological result dominated in the PDG constraint, but several orders of magnitude stronger than the other individual e_nu constraints considered by PDG.   We also consider consistency of the phenomenological constraints and the SM. The SM ignores the neutrino mass term and cannot describe the neutrino oscillations which makes it not a complete theory but a part of it. We demonstrate that the condition of the cancellation of the triangle anomaly within the complete theory does not disagree with the phenomenological constraints since different extensions of the SM may produce different additional contributions to the anomaly. In particular, we consider a minimal extension of the SM, where leptons (nu,e) are treated the same ways as quarks, which sets e_p+e_e=0 and allows for numerical strengthening the constraint on e_n and e_nu, which is e_n=-e_nu=(-0.4\pm1.0)10^-21 e.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Scattering Neutrinos, Spin Models, and Permutations</strong>, Duff Neill et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18677v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18677v1</a></p>

<p>We consider a class of Heisenberg all-to-all coupled spin models inspired by neutrino interactions in a supernova with $N$ degrees of freedom. These models are characterized by a coupling matrix that is relatively simple in the sense that there are only a few, relative to $N$, non-trivial eigenvalues, in distinction to the classic Heisenberg spin-glass models, leading to distinct behavior in both the high-temperature and low-temperature regimes. When the momenta of the neutrinos are uniform and random in directions, we can calculate the large-$N$ partition function for the quantum Heisenberg model. In particular, the high-temperature partition function predicts a non-Gaussian density of states, providing interesting counter-examples showing the limits of general theorems on the density of states for quantum spin models. We can repeat the same argument for classical Heisenberg models, also known as rotor models, and we find the high-temperature expansion is completely controlled by the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix, and again predicts non-Gaussian behavior for the density of states as long as the number of eigenvalues does not scale linearly with $N$. Indeed, we derive the amusing fact that these \emph{thermodynamic} partition functions are essentially the generating function for counting permutations in the high-temperature regime. Finally, for the case relevant to neutrinos in a supernova, we identify the low-temperature phase as a unique state with the direction of the momenta of the neutrino dictating its coherent state in flavor-space, a state we dub the âflavor-momentum-lockedâ state.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Majorana phases beyond neutrinoless double beta decay</strong>, Avital Dery et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18647v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18647v1</a></p>

<p>The $\nu_M{\rm SM}$ is defined as the SM extended to include dimension-5 operators. In this model neutrino masses violate lepton number, and two parameters of the lepton mixing matrix, the Majorana phases, are yet to be constrained. One combination of these phases and the neutrino masses, often denoted by $m_{ee}$, is probed by neutrinoless double beta decays ($0\nu\beta\beta$). We explore what information may be obtained beyond $0\nu\beta\beta$, and how it depends on the lightest neutrino mass. We point out that with current central values of the mixing parameters, $\Delta L_e=2$ and $\Delta L_e=\Delta L_\mu = 1$ (or $\Delta L_e=2$ and $\Delta L_\mu = 2$) processes cannot simultaneously vanish, providing a no-lose theorem, in principle, for excluding the $\nu_M{\rm SM}$, even in the case of normal mass ordering.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Neutrino masses and mixing from milli-charged dark matter</strong>, Sudip Jana et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18641v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18641v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a simple extension to the Standard Model, wherein neutrinos naturally attain small Majorana masses through a one-loop radiative mechanism featuring particles within the loops characterized by milli-charges. Unlike the conventional scotogenic model, our approach avoids imposing a discrete symmetry or expanding the gauge sector. The minuscule electric charges ensure the stability of the lightest particle within the loop as a viable dark matter candidate. Our investigation systematically scrutinizes the far-reaching phenomenological implications arising from these minuscule charges.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Neutrino emission in cold neutron stars: Bremsstrahlung and modified urca rates reexamined</strong>, Salvatore Bottaro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18640v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18640v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino emission in cold neutron stars is dominated by the modified urca (murca) process and nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. The standard emission rates were provided by Friman and Maxwell in 1979, effectively based on a chiral Lagrangian framework with pion and rho meson exchange, supplemented by Landau parameters to describe short-range interactions. We reevaluate these rates within the same framework, correcting several errors and removing unnecessary simplifications, notably the triangular approximation â Fermi momenta of protons and leptons negligible compared to the neutrons one â in MURCA, and quantify their importance. The impact of rho meson exchange, previously argued to cancel with interference effects, is actually quite relevant. Altogether, the cooling rates are reduced by as much as a factor 2. We provide comprehensive analytical formulas encompassing all contributions, designed for straightforward numerical implementation. Our results are particularly relevant for astrophysical studies of neutron stars evolution and for studies of physics beyond the standard model, where the emission of new particles â such as axions â is typically computed within the same framework we adopt here.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Pseudo-Dirac Neutrinos and Relic Neutrino Matter Effect on the High-energy Neutrino Flavor Composition</strong>, P. S. Bhupal Dev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18507v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18507v1</a></p>

<p>We show that if neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac, they can potentially affect the flavor ratio predictions for the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube. In this context, we point out a novel matter effect induced by the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) on the flavor ratio composition. Specifically, the active-sterile neutrino oscillations over the astrophysical baseline lead to an energy-dependent flavor ratio at Earth due to the C$\nu$B matter effect, which is distinguishable from the vacuum oscillation effect, provided there is a local C$\nu$B overdensity. Considering the projected precision of the 3-neutrino oscillation parameter measurements and improved flavor triangle measurements, we show that the next-generation neutrino telescopes, such as IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT, can probe the pseudo-Dirac neutrino hypothesis in a distinctive way.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>$Î_{\rm s}$CDM cosmology: Alleviating major cosmological tensions by predicting standard neutrino properties</strong>, Anita Yadav et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18496v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18496v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate a two-parameter extension of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model by allowing variations in the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ and their total mass $\sum m_\nu$. Our motivation is twofold: (i) to examine whether $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM retains its success in fitting the data and addressing major cosmological tensions, without suggesting a need for a deviation from the standard model of particle physics, and (ii) to determine whether the data indicate new physics that could potentially address cosmological tensions, either in the post-recombination universe through the late-time mirror AdS-dS transition, or in the pre-recombination universe through modifications in the standard values of $N_{\rm eff}$ and $\sum m_\nu$, or both. Within the extended $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, referred to as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM+$N_{\rm eff}$+$\sum m_{\rm \nu}$, we find no significant tension when considering the Planck-alone analysis. We observe that incorporating BAO data limits the further success of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM extension. However, the weakly model-dependent BAOtr data, along with Planck and Planck+PP\&amp;SH0ES, favor $H_0\sim 73\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}\, Mpc^{-1}}$. In cases where BAOtr dataset is used, the mirror AdS-dS transition is very effective in providing enhanced $H_0$ values, and thus the model requires no significant deviation from the standard value of $N_{\rm eff} = 3.044$. Both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are effectively addressed, with some compromise in the case of the Planck+BAO dataset. Finally, the upper bounds obtained on $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.5$~eV are fully compatible with neutrino oscillation experiments. Our findings provide evidence that late-time physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, such as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, without altering the standard pre-recombination universe, can suffice to alleviate the major cosmological tensions.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Transition magnetic moment of Majorana neutrinos in the triplets next-to-minimal MSSM</strong>, Zhao-Yang Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18323v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18323v1</a></p>

<p>The TNMSSM is an attractive extension of the Standard Model. It combines the advantages of the NMSSM and the TMSSM to give three tiny Majorana neutrinos masses via a type I+II seesaw mechanism. With the on-shell renormalization scheme, we consider the neutrino masses up to one loop approximation. Applying the effective Lagrangian method, we study the transition magnetic moments of Majorana neutrinos and consider the normal hierarchy (NH) and inverse hierarchy (IH) neutrino mass spectra within the constraints of experimental data on neutrino oscillations. The solar neutrino transition magnetic moment is further deduced, and compared with the XENONnT experiment limit.</p>

<p>2024-06-27, <strong>A Superfluid Dark Matter Cosmic String Wake</strong>, Aline Favero et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19325v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.19325v1</a></p>

<p>We study the effects of superfluid dark matter on the structure of a cosmic string wake, considering both the effects of regular and quantum pressure terms. We consider the total fluid to consist of a combination of baryons and dark matter. Hence, we are also able to study the effects of superfluid dark matter on the distribution of baryons inside the wake. We focus on parameter values for the superfluid dark matter which allow a MONDian explanation of galaxy rotation curves.</p>

<p>2024-06-27, <strong>Interacting ultralight dark matter and dark energy and fits to cosmological data in a field theory approach</strong>, Amin Aboubrahim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19284v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.19284v1</a></p>

<p>The description of dark matter as a pressure-less fluid and of dark energy as a cosmological constant, both minimally coupled to gravity, constitutes the basis of the concordance $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ model. However, the concordance model is based on using equations of motion directly for the fluids with constraints placed on their sources, and lacks an underlying Lagrangian. In this work, we propose a Lagrangian model of two spin zero fields describing dark energy and dark matter with an interaction term between the two along with self-interactions. We study the background evolution of the fields as well as their linear perturbations, suggesting an alternative to $\Lambda$CDM with dark matter and dark energy being fundamental dynamical fields. The parameters of the model are extracted using a Bayesian inference tool based on multiple cosmological data sets which include those of Planck (with lensing), BAO, Pantheon, SH0ES, and WiggleZ. Using these data, we set constraints on the dark matter mass and the interaction strengths. Furthermore, we find that the model is able to alleviate the Hubble tension for some data sets while also resolving the $S_8$ tension.</p>

<p>2024-06-27, <strong>Rotation curves velocities obtained by warm low-density plasma simulating dark halos and dark matter</strong>, Y. Ben-Aryeh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19218v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.19218v1</a></p>

<p>The free electron model with Boltzmann statistics for spherical low-density plasmas is developed further with asymptotic relations obtaining the density of electrons, mass densities, and the potentials of such plasmas. Solutions are developed as function of a pure number proportional to the distance from the stellar plasma center (galaxy center) with extremely small coefficient, so that these solutions are essentially functions of large astronomical distances and masses. The present plasma is divided into a central part and very long tail, where the central part of the plasma shows an exponential dependence on the distance from the galaxy center, but a part of the large mass of this plasma is included in the long stellar plasma tail. The present model is specialized to completely ionized Hydrogen plasma (with a small correction factor considering its mixture with heavier atoms) where emission and absorption of spectral lines can be neglected in the warm low density stellar plasma. We apply the present approach for treating rotation curves measurements, A general theory for rotation curves should include the superposition of the gravitational potentials introduced by the high-density compact stars, with those of the low-density stellar plasma potentials. But for halos which are at extremely large distance from the galaxy center, the dominant effects would be those of dark matter, and such dark halos are permeating and surrounding the compact galactic stars. Such plasma is found to be transparent in most of the EM spectrum. The existence of a large mass for the warm low-density plasma may solve the problem of missing mass in rotation curves measurements.</p>

<p>2024-06-27, <strong>Axion Detection Experiments Meet the Majoron</strong>, Qiuyue Liang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19083v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.19083v1</a></p>

<p>The majoron is a well-motivated light (pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone) boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of a global lepton-number symmetry. In this {\it letter}, we relate the spontaneous breaking scale and its soft-breaking mass by requiring that the majoron is the main component of the dark matter. An electromagnetic-anomalous coupling can be induced by minimally modifying the original majoron model, surprisingly, predicting a parameter region that largely overlaps with the QCD-axion dark matter band. Thus, we expect that axion search experiments meet the majoron.</p>

<p>2024-06-27, <strong>A halo model approach to describe clustering and emission of the two main star forming galaxy populations for Cosmic Infrared Background studies</strong>, Giorgia Zagatti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19069v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.19069v1</a></p>

<p>The Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB), traced by the emission from dusty star-forming galaxies, provides a crucial window into the phases of star formation throughout cosmic history. These galaxies, although challenging to detect individually at high redshifts due to their faintness, cumulatively contribute to the CIB which then becomes a powerful probe of galaxy formation, evolution and clustering. Here, we introduce a physically-motivated model for the CIB emission spanning a wide range of frequency and angular resolution, employing a halo model approach and distinguishing, within dark matter halos, between two main populations of star forming galaxies, i.e. normal late-type spiral and irregular galaxies and the progenitors of early-type galaxies. The emission from two galaxy populations maps into different regimes in frequency/resolution space, allowing us to constrain the clustering parameters of the model - $M_{\text{min}}$, the mass of a halo with 50% probability of having a central galaxy and $\alpha$, the power law index regulating the number of satellite galaxies - through a fit to Planck and Herschel-SPIRE CIB anisotropy measurements. We find that, while being able to place constraints on some of the clustering parameters, the Planck frequency and multipole coverage cannot effectively disentangle the contributions from the two galaxy populations. On the other side, the Herschel-SPIRE measurements separate out and constrain the clustering of both populations. Our work, though, highlights an inconsistency of the results between the two datasets, partially already reported in other literature and still not understood.</p>

H. et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19004v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.19004v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, we aim to explore the potential for generating events related to dark matter (DM) in conjunction with a neutral heavy gauge boson (Z$^{\prime}$) decaying leptonically during proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These collisions occur at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV, with a high integrated luminosity equivalent to 1000 fb$^{-1}$. Our analysis involves interpreting the outcomes through Monte Carlo simulation of the effective field theory (EFT) framework. If no new physics is detected, we establish constraints on various parameters within the EFT context, such as the scenario cutoff scale ($\Lambda$) and the Z$^{\prime}$ mass.</p>

<p>We study the $\gamma$-ray signal emitted from dark matter (DM) pair annihilation in the Higgs portal Majorana fermion DM model. In the model, a Majorana fermion DM $\chi$ couples with the Standard Model (SM) Higgs field $H$ through a higher-dimensional term $-{\cal L}\supset H^\dagger H \bar{\chi}\chi/\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ is a cutoff scale. The pair annihilation of $\chi$ through the above term produces the Higgs boson and the longitudinal modes of $W,Z$ gauge bosons. The Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies (dSphs) are used as the most promising targets to search for the $\gamma$-ray signal of the model, due to high DM density and lack of astrophysical backgrounds. The {\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope ({\it Fermi}-LAT) is used for the search, for its high sensitivity. In this work, we use 14-year {\it Fermi}-LAT data from 16 dSphs, to constrain the DM pair annihilation cross section for the DM mass range from 125 GeV to 100 TeV.</p>

<p>We explore the well know mass deficit/surplus phenomenon in General Relativity to suggest that it could play a part in the dark matter conundrum. Specifically in collapses and condensations of matter associated with negative intrinsic curvature of the foliation associated with the asymptotic boundary conditions, the external (ADM) mass can vastly exceed the integrated local energy over the internal volume. This can be phrased in terms of a deficit of volume for a given surface area (with respect to zero curvature). We explore the phenomenon in the context of generalizations of the Oppenheimer-Snyder models and other âcut and pasteâ models, the Lemaitre-Bondi-Tolman metric and several others. We produce constructions where the internal object is contracting or expanding, has a life time different from the asymptotic Universe, as well as a volume different than the escavated volume from the Universe. These are purely relativistic constructions and they could play a role in the puzzle of dark matter: attraction without visible or indeed any matter.</p>

<p>2024-06-27, <strong>Insights into Gravitinos Abundance, Cosmic Strings and Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</strong>, K. El Bourakadi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18828v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18828v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we investigate D-term inflation within the framework of supergravity, employing the minimal Kahler potential. Our study reveals that this model can overcome the {\eta}-problem found in F-term models. Additionally, we explore reheating dynamics and gravitino production, emphasizing the interplay between reheating temperature, spectral index, and gravitino abundance. Our analysis indicates that gravitino production is sensitive to the equation of state during reheating, affecting the reheating temperature and subsequent dark matter relic density. Perturbation theory reveals that Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) evolve according to second-order effects arising from first-order curvature perturbations. In fact, the spectral energy density of these waves is particularly relevant to Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations. Furthermore, we analyze gravitational waves generated by cosmic strings, providing critical constraints on early Universe dynamics and cosmic string properties. The dimensionless string tension significantly influences the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings post-inflation. Finally, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings is influenced by the energy scales of inflation and string formation.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Not So Round: VLA Observations of the Starless Dark Matter Halo Candidate Cloud-9</strong>, Alejandro BenÃ­tez-Llambay et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18643v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18643v1</a></p>

<p>Observations with FAST recently detected HI 21-cm emission near M94, revealing an intriguing object, Cloud-9, without an optical counterpart. Subsequent analysis suggests Cloud-9 is consistent with a gas-rich ($M_{\rm HI} \approx 10^{6} \ M_{\odot}$), starless dark matter (DM) halo of mass $M_{200} \approx 5 \times 10^{9} \ M_{\odot}$. Using VLA in D-array configuration, we present interferometric observations of Cloud-9 revealing it as a dynamically cold ($W_{50} \approx 12 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$), non-rotating, and spatially-asymmetric system, exhibiting gas compression on one side and a tail-like structure towards the other, features likely originating from ram pressure. Our observations suggest Cloud-9 is consistent with a starless $\Lambda$CDM dark matter halo if the gas is largely isothermal. If interpreted as a faint dwarf, Cloud-9 is similar to Leo T, a nearby gas-rich galaxy that would fall below current optical detection limits at Cloud-9âs distance ($d\approx 5 \rm \ Mpc$). Further observations with HST reaching magnitudes $m_{g} \approx 30$ would help identify such a galaxy or dramatically lower current limits to its stellar mass ($M_{\rm gal} \lesssim 10^{5} \ M_{\odot}$). Cloud-9 thus stands as the firmest starless DM halo candidate to date or the faintest galaxy known at its distance.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>$\overline{\text{D}}$arkRayNet: Emulation of cosmic-ray antideuteron fluxes from dark matter</strong>, Jan Heisig et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18642v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18642v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmic-ray antimatter, particularly low-energy antideuterons, serves as a sensitive probe of dark matter annihilating in our Galaxy. We study this smoking-gun signature and explore its complementarity with indirect dark matter searches using cosmic-ray antiprotons. To this end, we develop the neural network emulator $\overline{\text{D}}$arkRayNet, enabling a fast prediction of propagated antideuteron energy spectra for a wide range of annihilation channels and their combinations. We revisit the Monte Carlo simulation of antideuteron coalescence and cosmic-ray propagation, allowing us to explore the uncertainties of both processes. In particular, we take into account uncertainties from the $\Lambda_b$ production rate and consider two distinctly different propagation models. Requiring consistency with cosmic-ray antiproton limits, we find that AMS-02 shows sensitivity to a few windows of dark matter masses only, most prominently below 20 GeV. This region can be probed independently by the upcoming GAPS experiment. The program package $\overline{\text{D}}$arkRayNet is available on GitHub.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Dark Matter from Dark Glueball Dominance</strong>, David McKeen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18635v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18635v1</a></p>

<p>New gauge forces can play an important role in the evolution of the early universe. In this work we investigate the cosmological implications of a pure Yang-Mills dark sector that is dominantly populated after primordial inflation. Such a dark sector takes the form of a bath of dark gluons at high temperatures, but confines at lower temperatures to produce a spectrum of dark glueballs. These glueballs then undergo a freezeout process such that the remnant population is nearly completely dominated by the lightest state. To reproduce the observed cosmology, this lightest glueball species must decay to the Standard Model to repopulate and reheat it. At leading order, this can occur through a connector operator of dimension-6. In contrast, other glueballs can be parametrically long-lived or stable, and remain as contributors to dark matter or modify the observed cosmology through their later decays. In this work we study the evolution of such dark sectors in detail. We demonstrate that stable remnant glueballs can produce the measured dark matter abundance. We also derive broad constraints on non-Abelian dark sectors from overproduction of remnant glueballs when they are stable or from their destructive impact when they are able to decay.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Studying single-electron traps in newly fabricated Skipper-CCDs for the Oscura experiment using the pocket-pumping technique</strong>, S. E. Perez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18502v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18502v1</a></p>

<p>Understanding and characterizing very low-energy ($\sim$eV) background sources is a must in rare-event searches. Oscura, an experiment aiming to probe electron recoils from sub-GeV dark matter using a 10-kg skipper-CCD detector, has recently fabricated its first two batches of sensors. In this work, we present the characterization of defects/contaminants identified in the buried-channel region of these newly fabricated skipper-CCDs. These defects/contaminants produce deferred charge from trap emission in the images next to particle tracks, which can be spatially resolved due to the sub-electron resolution achieved with these sensors. Using the trap-pumping technique, we measured the energy and cross section associated to these traps in three Oscura prototype sensors from different fabrication batches which underwent different gettering methods during fabrication. Results suggest that the type of defects/contaminants is more closely linked to the fabrication batch rather than to the gettering method used. The exposure-dependent single-electron rate (SER) of one of these sensors was measured $\sim$100~m underground, yielding $(1.8\pm 0.3)\times10^{-3}~e^-$/pix/day at 131K. The impact of the identified traps on the measured exposure-dependent SER is evaluated via a Monte Carlo simulation. Results suggest that the exposure-dependent SER of Oscura prototype sensors would be lower in lower background environments as expected.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Hint to Supersymmetry from GR Vacuum</strong>, Gia Dvali et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18402v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18402v1</a></p>

<p>The $S$-matrix formulation of gravity suggests that the $\theta$-vacuum structure must not be sustained by the theory. We point out that, when applied to the vacuum of general relativity, this criterion hints to supersymmetry. The topological susceptibility of gravitational vacuum induced by Eguchi-Hanson instantons can be eliminated neither by spin-$1/2$ fermions nor by an axion coupled via them since such fermions do not provide instanton zero modes. Instead, the job is done by a spin-$3/2$ fermion, hence realizing a local supersymmetry. This scenario also necessitates the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry and predicts the existence of axion of $R$-symmetry which gets mass exclusively from the gravitational instantons. The $R$-axion can be a viable dark matter candidate. Matching between the index and the anomaly imposes a constraint that spin-$1/2$ fermions should not contribute to the chiral gravitational anomaly.</p>

<p>The Euclid mission of the European Space Agency will provide weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering surveys that can be used to constrain the standard cosmological model and its extensions, with an opportunity to test the properties of dark matter beyond the minimal cold dark matter paradigm. We present forecasts from the combination of these surveys on the parameters describing four interesting and representative non-minimal dark matter models: a mixture of cold and warm dark matter relics; unstable dark matter decaying either into massless or massive relics; and dark matter experiencing feeble interactions with relativistic relics. We model these scenarios at the level of the non-linear matter power spectrum using emulators trained on dedicated N-body simulations. We use a mock Euclid likelihood to fit mock data and infer error bars on dark matter parameters marginalised over other parameters. We find that the Euclid photometric probe (alone or in combination with CMB data from the Planck satellite) will be sensitive to the effect of each of the four dark matter models considered here. The improvement will be particularly spectacular for decaying and interacting dark matter models. With Euclid, the bounds on some dark matter parameters can improve by up to two orders of magnitude compared to current limits. We discuss the dependence of predicted uncertainties on different assumptions: inclusion of photometric galaxy clustering data, minimum angular scale taken into account, modelling of baryonic feedback effects. We conclude that the Euclid mission will be able to measure quantities related to the dark sector of particle physics with unprecedented sensitivity. This will provide important information for model building in high-energy physics. Any hint of a deviation from the minimal cold dark matter paradigm would have profound implications for cosmology and particle physics.</p>

<p>Aether Scalar-Tensor theory is a modification of general relativity proposed to explain galactic and cosmological mass discrepancies conventionally attributed to dark matter. The theory is able to fit the cosmic microwave background and the linear matter power spectrum without dark matter. In this work, we derive the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in this theory and solve it for realistic nuclear equations of state to predict the mass-radius relation of neutron stars. We find solutions that are compatible with all current observations of neutron stars.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>The impact of constrained interacting dark energy on the bound-zone velocity profile</strong>, Jounghun Lee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18210v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18210v1</a></p>

<p>We numerically study the effects of constrained interacting dark energy (CIDER) on the bound-zone velocity profiles around massive dark matter halos. Analyzing the CIDER simulations performed by Baldi (2023) for three different cases of dark sector coupling ($\beta=0.03$, $0.05$ and $0.08$) as well as for the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology ($\beta=0$), we determine the mean peculiar velocity profiles in the bound zones around the friends-of-friends halos with masses larger than $M_{\rm cut}=3\times 10^{13}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ at three redshifts, $z=0$, $0.5$ and $1$. It is found that the universal power-law formula proposed by Falco et al. (2024) originally for the $\Lambda$CDM case still describes well the bound-zone velocity profiles, $V(r)$, even in the CIDER models. The slope of $V(r)$, turns out to be significantly affected by the CIDER, progressively decreasing as $\beta$ increases. Meanwhile, the amplitude of $V(r)$ exhibits little dependence on $\beta$, which is ascribed to the identical Hubble parameters shared by the $\Lambda$CDM and CIDER models in the entire redshift range. Our results imply that the bound-zone velocity slope can break a degeneracy even between the $\Lambda$CDM and CIDER models with $\beta\le 0.03$, which the standard cosmological diagnostics fail to distinguish. We devise a simple analytic formula for the bound-zone slope as a function of $\beta$, and prove its validity at all of the three redshifts. It is concluded that the slope of the mean bound-zone peculiar velocity profile should be in principle a powerful probe of dark sector interaction.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Complex scalar dark matter in a new gauged U(1) symmetry with kinetic and direct mixings</strong>, Yu-Hang Su et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18170v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18170v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a scalar dark matter model featuring a hidden gauge symmetry, denoted as U(1)_X, with two complex scalars, Phi and S. In this framework, Phi spontaneously breaks the U(1)_X gauge symmetry, while S serves as a viable dark matter candidate. Particularly, the kinetic and direct mixings between the U(1)_X and U(1)_Y gauge groups provide a portal between dark matter and the Standard Model particles. These mixings offer a plausible explanation for the W boson mass anomaly observed by the CDF Collaboration. We study the comprehensive phenomenological constraints of this model from colliders and dark matter detection experiments, including Zâ searches at the LHC, the 125 GeV Higgs boson measurements, the relic density of dark matter and the indirect detection of dark matter annihilation. By randomly scanning the parameter space, we find that the regions where m_(Zâ) &gt; 4750 GeV and m_(Zâ) &lt; 4750 GeV for g_x close to 1 remain viable and can be tested by future experiments.</p>

<p>We searched the Chandra and XMM archives for observations of 900 green pea galaxies to find AGN signatures. Green peas are low-mass galaxies with prominent emission lines, similar in size and star formation rate to high-redshift dwarf galaxies. Of the 29 observations found, 9 show X-ray detections with $S/N&gt;3$. The 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity for these 9 sources exceeds $10^{40}~\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$, with 2 sources exceeding $10^{41}~\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$, suggesting the presence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBH) or low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) with BH masses between $100-10^6M_\mathrm{\odot}$. All X-ray detected sources (plus 6 additional sources) show He~II$\lambda4686$ emission and a broad component of the H$\alpha$ emission line, indicating winds. The line widths of the broad H$\alpha$ and He II$\lambda4686$ emitting gas clouds are weakly correlated ($R^{2}=0.15$), suggesting He II$\lambda4686$ emission is inconsistent with winds from super-Eddington accretors. However, the ratio of X-ray luminosity to star formation rate shows an anti-correlation with metallicity in 5 out of 9 X-ray detected sources, implying ultraluminous X-ray sources are key contributors to the observed X-ray luminosity. This could be due to super-Eddington accretors or IMBH. The X-ray emission is much higher than that produced by Wolf-Rayet stars and supernovae-driven winds. Thus, the X-ray luminosity in these 9 sources can only be explained by black holes with masses over $100~M_\mathrm{\odot}$. Our findings suggest the presence of LLAGN in these galaxies, with broad H$\alpha$ line widths implying BH masses of $10^4-10^6M_\mathrm{\odot}$. Given Green Peasâ role as significant Lyman Continuum leakers, LLAGN in these galaxies could have contributed significantly to cosmic reionization.</p>

Probing the early chemical evolution of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy with carbon abundances</strong>, Federico Sestito et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18636v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18636v1</a></p>

<p>Carbon abundances, especially at low metallicity, reveal the early chemical evolution of a system, tracing the supernovae (SNe) that contributed and how much of their ejecta made it into the next stellar generation. Our sample from the \textit{Pristine} Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) includes $\sim 350$ metal-poor ([Fe/H]~$&lt;-1.5$) stars in the main body of Sgr with good quality spectroscopic observations. Our metal-poor Sgr population has a larger velocity dispersion than metal-rich Sgr from the literature, which could be explained by outside-in star formation, extreme Galactic tidal perturbations and/or the presence of a metal-rich disc/bar $+$ a metal-poor halo. The average carbon abundance in Sgr is similar to that of other classical dwarf galaxies (DGs) and consistently lower than in the Milky Way by $\sim0.2-0.3$~dex at low metallicity. The interstellar medium in DGs, including Sgr, may have retained yields from more energetic Pop III and II SNe, thereby reducing the average [C/Fe]. Additionally, SNe~Ia, producing more Fe than C, would start to contribute at lower metallicity in DGs/Sgr than in the Galaxy. The presence of a [C/Fe] gradient for Sgr stars with [Fe/H]~$\gtrsim-2.0$ ($\sim 6.8\times 10^{-4}$ dex arcmin$^{-1}$) suggests that SNe~Ia contributed in the system at those metallicities, especially in its inner regions. There is a low frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in our Sgr sample. At higher metallicity/carbon abundance (mostly CEMP-s) this may be due to photometric selection effects, but those are less likely to affect CEMP-no stars. We propose that, given the lower average [C/Fe] in DGs, using the same CEMP definition ([C/Fe]~$&gt;+0.7$) as in the Galaxy under-predicts the number of CEMP stars in DGs, and for Sgr a cut at [C/Fe]$~\sim +0.35$ may be more appropriate, which brings the frequency of CEMP stars in agreement with that in the Galaxy.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>The aspherical explosions of the 03fg-like Type Ia supernovae 2021zny and 2022ilv revealed by polarimetry</strong>, T. Nagao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18110v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18110v1</a></p>

<p>A peculiar subtype of Type Ia supernovae (SNe), 03fg-like (super-Chandrasekhar) SNe, show different observational properties from prototypical Type Ia SNe, typically having high luminosity at the light-curve peak, low expansion velocities, and strong carbon features. The origin of this class of Type Ia SNe has been actively debated. Recent nebular-phase infrared observations of the 03fg-like Type Ia SN 2022pul using the James Webb Space Telescope revealed large-scale asymmetries in the ejecta and the presence of the strong [Ne II] line at 12.81 $\mu$m, suggesting a violent merger of two white dwarfs as its origin. Polarimetry is another powerful tool to study overall ejecta asymmetries of spatially-unresolved SNe. Here, we aim to check the universality of the violent merger scenario as the origin of the 03fg-like Type Ia SNe, by studying their explosion geometries using polarimetry. In this letter, we present imaging-polarimetric observations of the two 03fg-like Type Ia SNe 2021zny and 2022ilv. SNe 2021zny and 2022ilv show high intrinsic polarization ($\sim1$ % -$\sim2$ %), which might be composed of multiple components with different polarization angles. This indicates that they have complex aspherical structures in their ejecta, supporting the violent merger scenario for their origin. Our observations provide the first clear evidence from polarimetry for such aspherical structures.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>Observational Evidence to Logistic Dark Energy Driving the Accelerating Universe</strong>, Sarath Nelleri et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18095v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18095v1</a></p>

<p>We present logistic dark energy model (LDEM), where the dark energy density follows a logistic function for the scale factor. The equation of state parameter of dark energy ($w_D$) transitioned from $-1$ in the distant past to its current value of $-0.76$, closely resembling the $\Lambda$CDM model in the early epoch and showing significant deviation in the late phase. The evolution of the deceleration parameter in the LDEM signifies its success in explaining the late-time cosmic acceleration. Model selection based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), incorporating observations from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), Observational Hubble data (OHD), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) strongly favors the LDEM over the conventional $\Lambda$CDM model, where BIC is estimated to be $\sim -20$. Incorporating the shift parameter derived from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data shows competing evidence of the LDEM over the standard $\Lambda$CDM. Remarkably, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) value computed using any of the datasets tends to align closely with the predictions from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), suggesting a need to reconsider the local measurement.</p>

<p>2024-06-26, <strong>NEOWISE-R Caught the Luminous SN 2023ixf in Messier 101</strong>, Schuyler D. Van Dyk et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18005v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.18005v1</a></p>

<p>The reactivated Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE-R) serendipitously caught the Type II supernova SN 2023ixf in Messier 101 on the rise, starting day 3.6 through day 10.9, and on the late-time decline from days 211 through 213 and days 370 through 372. We have considered these mid-infrared (mid-IR) data together with observations from the ultraviolet (UV) through the near-IR, when possible. At day 3.6 we approximated the optical emission with a hot, ~26,630 K blackbody, with a notable UV excess likely from strong SN shock interaction with circumstellar matter (CSM). In the IR, however, a clear excess is also obvious, and we fit it with a cooler, ~1,620 K blackbody with radius of ~2.6 x 10^{15} cm, consistent with dust in the progenitorâs circumstellar shell likely heated by the UV emission from the CSM interaction. On day 10.8, the light detected was consistent with SN ejecta-dominated emission. At late times we also observed a clear NEOWISE-R excess, which could arise either from newly formed dust in the inner ejecta or in the contact discontinuity between the forward and reverse shocks, or from more distant pre-existing dust grains in the SN environment. Furthermore, the large 4.6 micron excess at late times can also be explained by the emergence of the carbon monoxide 1â0 vibrational band. SN 2023ixf is the best-observed SN IIP in the mid-IR during the first several days after explosion and one of the most luminous such SNe ever seen.</p>
