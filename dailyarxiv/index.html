<p>2024-10-21, <strong>Enhanced $S$-factor for the $^{14}$N$(p,γ)^{15}$O reaction and its impact on the solar composition problem</strong>, X. Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16086v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.16086v1</a></p>

<p>The solar composition problem has puzzled astrophysicists for more than 20 years. Recent measurements of carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) neutrinos by the Borexino experiment show a $\sim2\sigma$ tension with the “low-metallicity” determinations. $^{14}$N$(p,\gamma)^{15}$O, the slowest reaction in the CNO cycle, plays a crucial role in the standard solar model (SSM) calculations of CNO neutrino fluxes. Here we report a direct measurement of the $^{14}$N$(p,\gamma)^{15}$O reaction, in which $S$-factors for all transitions were simultaneously determined in the energy range of $E_p=110-260$ keV for the first time. Our results resolve previous discrepancies in the ground-state transition, yielding a zero-energy $S$-factor $S_{114}(0) = 1.92\pm0.08$ keV b which is 14% higher than the $1.68\pm0.14$ keV b recommended in Solar Fusion III (SF-III). With our $S_{114}$ values, the SSM B23-GS98, and the latest global analysis of solar neutrino measurements, the C and N photospheric abundance determined by the Borexino experiment is updated to $N_{\mathrm{CN}}=({4.45}^{+0.69}_{-0.61})\times10^{-4}$. This new $N_{\mathrm{CN}}$ value agrees well with latest “high-metallicity” composition, however, is also consistent with the “low-metallicity” determination within $\sim 1\sigma$ C.L., indicating that the solar metallicity problem remains an open question. In addition, the significant reduction in the uncertainty of $S_{114}$ paves the way for the precise determination of the CN abundance in future large-volume solar neutrino measurements.</p>

<p>2024-10-21, <strong>Summary of Global Extraction of the $\rm^{12}C$ Nuclear Electromagnetic Response Functions and Comparisons to Nuclear Theory and Neutrino/Electron Monte Carlo Generators at Nufact24</strong>, Arie Bodek et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15991v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.15991v2</a></p>

<p>We present a brief report (at the Nufact-2024 conference) summarizing a global extraction of the ${\rm ^{12}C}$ longitudinal (${\cal R}_L$) and transverse (${\cal R}_T$) nuclear electromagnetic response functions from an analysis of all available electron scattering data on carbon. Since the extracted response functions cover a large kinematic range they can be readily used for comparison to theoretical predictions as well as validation and tuning Monte Carlo (MC) generators for electron and neutrino scattering experiments. Comparisons to several theoretical approaches and MC generators are given in arXiv:2409.10637v1 [hep-ex]. We find that among all the theoretical models that were investigated, the ``Energy Dependent-Relativistic Mean Field’’ (ED-RMF) approach provides the best description of both the Quasielastic (QE) and {\it nuclear excitation} response functions (leading to single nucleon final states) over all values of four-momentum transfer. he QE data are also well described by the “Short Time Approximation Quantum Monte Carlo” (STA-QMC) calculation which includes both single and two nucleon final states which presently is only valid for momentum transfer $0.3&lt;{\bf q} &lt; 0.65$ GeV and does not include nuclear excitations. An analytic extrapolation of STA-QMC to lower $\bf q$ has been implemented in the GENIE MC generator for $\rm^{4}He$ and a similar extrapolation for ${\rm ^{12}C}$ is under development. STA validity for ${\bf q} &gt;$ 0.65 GeV requires the implementation of relativistic corrections. Both approaches have the added benefit that the calculations are also directly applicable to the same kinematic regions for neutrino scattering. In addition we also report on a universal fit to all electron scattering data that can be used in lieu of experimental data for validation of Monte Carlo generators (and is in the process of being implemented in GENIE).</p>

<p>2024-10-21, <strong>Flavor-changing phenomenology in a $U(1)$ model</strong>, N. T. Duy et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15635v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.15635v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate a family-nonuniversal Abelian extension of hypercharge, which significantly alters the phenomenological features of the standard model. Anomaly cancellation requires that the third quark family transforms differently from the first two quark families. Additionally, it acquires that three right-handed neutrinos are presented. This model generates naturally small neutrino masses and a $W$-boson mass deviation appropriate to recent measurements. Additionally, the model introduces flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) of quarks coupled to the new gauge boson $Z’$ and new Higgs fields. These FCNCs significantly modify the neutral-meson mixing amplitudes and rare meson decays, which are studied in detail. We also address flavor changing processes in the charged lepton sector.</p>

<h1 id="dark-matter-7">dark matter (7)</h1>

<p>2024-10-21, <strong>Multiparticle scalar dark matter with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry</strong>, Subhaditya Bhattacharya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16275v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.16275v1</a></p>

<p>More than one dark sector particle transforming under the same symmetry provides one stable dark matter (DM) component which undergoes co-annihilation with the heavier particle(s) decaying to DM. Specific assumptions on the kinematics and on the coupling parameters may render the heavier component(s) stable and contribute as DM. The choices of the charges of the dark sector fields under transformation play a crucial role in the resultant phenomenology. In this paper, we systematically address the possibility of obtaining two scalar DM components under $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry. We consider both the possibilities of DM being weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) or pseudofeebly interacting massive particle (pFIMP). We elaborate upon $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetric model, confronting the relic density allowed parameter space with recent most direct and indirect search bounds and prospects. We also highlight the possible distinction of the allowed parameter space in single component and two component cases, as well as between WIMP-WIMP and WIMP-pFIMP scenarios.</p>

<p>2024-10-21, <strong>The impact of the local stellar radiation on the formation and evolution of dwarfs in and near Milky Way analogue</strong>, Bocheng Zhu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16176v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.16176v1</a></p>

<p>We explore the effect of local stellar radiation on the formation and evolution of the dwarf galaxies near the Milk Way(MW) analogues. Using five simulations from the Auriga project, both with and without local stellar radiation, we find that the local stellar radiation, as a pre-reionization source, is quite effective to photoionize and heat the gas around the proto-MW analogues. As a result, the formation of surrounding dwarf galaxies in dark matter halos with halo masses below approximately $10^{9.5}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ are significantly suppressed. After the reionization, the intensity of the local stellar radiation eventually becomes comparable to that of UVB, consequently the impact of local stellar radiation on the surrounding dwarf galaxy formation decreases with decreasing redshift, and almost vanishes after redshift $z=4$. At present day, the bright satellite population in the simulations with and without local stellar radiation is nearly identical. While our simulation have no enough resolution to resolve the fainest satellite galaxies which are most prone to the local stellar radiation, we use accreted galaxy mass function to assess the impact, and find that the reduction in the faintest satellite is around $13$ percent in case of the local stellar radiation, a factor not negligible to constrain dark matter models using the precise abundance of MW satellite galaxies.</p>

<p>2024-10-21, <strong>Correcting for Selection Biases in the Determination of the Hubble Constant from Time-Delay Cosmography</strong>, Tian Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16171v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.16171v2</a></p>

<p>The time delay between multiple images of strongly lensed quasars has been used to infer the Hubble constant. The primary systematic uncertainty for time-delay cosmography is the mass-sheet transform (MST), which preserves the lensing observables while altering the inferred $H_0$. The TDCOSMO collaboration used velocity dispersion measurements of lensed quasars and lensed galaxies to infer that mass sheets are present, which decrease the inferred $H_0$ by 8$\%$. Here, we test the assumption that the density profiles of galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-quasar lenses are the same. We use a composite star-plus-dark-matter mass profile for the parent deflector population and model the selection function for galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-quasar lenses. We find that a power-law density profile with an MST is a good approximation to a two-component mass profile around the Einstein radius, but we find that galaxy-galaxy lenses have systematically higher mass-sheet components than galaxy-quasar lenses. For individual systems, $\lambda_\mathrm{int}$ correlates with the ratio of the half-light radius and Einstein radius of the lens. By propagating these results through the TDCOSMO methodology, we find that $H_0$ is lowered by a further $\sim$3\%. Using the velocity dispersions from \citet{slacs9} and our fiducial model for selection biases, we infer $H_0 = 66\pm4 \ \mathrm{(stat)} \pm 1 \ \mathrm{(model \ sys)} \pm 2 \ \mathrm{(measurement \ sys)} \ \mathrm{km} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1} \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for the TDCOSMO plus SLACS dataset. The first residual systematic error is due to plausible alternative choices in modeling the selection function, and the second is an estimate of the remaining systematic error in the measurement of velocity dispersions for SLACS lenses. Accurate time-delay cosmography requires precise velocity dispersion measurements and accurate calibration of selection biases.</p>

<p>2024-10-21, <strong>Search for New Particles with Flying Quantum Sensors in Space</strong>, Huang Xingming et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15755v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.15755v1</a></p>

<p>Recent advancements in space science and technologies offer exciting prospects for investigating novel research that is unattainable within terrestrial laboratories. Here we propose the implementation of space-based quantum sensing to explore ultralight new particles beyond the standard model. The central idea involves probing long-range interactions between spin ensembles of space quantum sensors and the particles residing within Earth, mediated by ultralight particles. We show that such interactions can be substantially enhanced in space platforms and thus increase the search sensitivity. In contrast to their terrestrial counterparts, space-based quantum searches exhibit remarkable velocity enhancements, approaching the first cosmic speed, and thus enables the exploration of unexplored parameter space concerning ultralight new particles. Furthermore, the substantial abundance of electrons and nucleons within Earth plays a crucial role in extending the scope of our mission. Our projected search sensitivity can surpass the sensitivities of both terrestrial experiments and proposals by up to approximately 7 orders of magnitude. We also briefly discuss other space mission, including ``space-ground integrated” network of quantum sensors for dark matter searches.</p>

<p>2024-10-21, <strong>Non-thermal production of Higgsino dark matter by late-decaying scalar fields</strong>, Hajime Fukuda et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15733v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.15733v1</a></p>

<p>We study the non-thermal production of the Higgsino dark matter (DM). Assuming that the lightest neutral Higgsino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in minimal supersymmetric standard model, we calculate the relic abundance of the Higgsino LSP produced by the decay of late-decaying scalar field. In the calculation of the relic abundance, we have properly included the effects of coannihilation as well as the non-perturbative effect (known as the Sommerfeld effect). Contrary to the case of the thermal-relic scenario, in which the observed DM abundance is realized with the Higgsino mass of ~ 1.2 TeV, Higgsino DM is possible with lighter Higgsino mass as the reheating temperature becomes lower than the Higgsino mass. The reheating temperature relevant for realizing the correct DM density is presented as a funciton of the Higgsino mass.</p>

<p>2024-10-21, <strong>Lyman-$α$ limit on axion-like cold dark matter</strong>, Zixuan Xu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15675v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.15675v1</a></p>

<p>Using low redshift data on astrophysical reionization, we report new Lyman-$\alpha$ limit on axion-like particle (ALP) as cold dark matter in ALP mass range of $m_{a}\sim 30-1000$ eV. Compared to the Leo T and soft-X ray bound, this limit is so far the most stringent in the ALP mass range of $m_{a}\sim 375-425$ eV and complementary in the ALP mass range otherwise. Combing these limits, we show new exclusion limits on $m_a$ for the ALP DM from either misalignment or freeze-in mechanism.</p>

<p>2024-10-21, <strong>Galactic and extragalactic probe of dark matter with LISA’s binary black holes near their galactic center</strong>, Sohan Ghodla et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15562v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.15562v1</a></p>

<p>The upcoming LISA mission will be able to detect gravitational waves from galactic and extragalactic compact binaries. Here, we report on LISA’s capability to probe dark matter around these binaries if the latter constitute black holes. By analyzing the variation in the chirp mass of the binary, we show that depending on the black hole masses, LISA should be able to probe their surrounding dark matter to a luminosity distance of $\approx 1$ Gpc if such binaries are observed within the inner $\approx 10$ pc of their galactic center for particle-like dark matter or near the galactic solitonic core for wave-like dark matter. In the case a null result is recorded during the course of observation of \emph{well-localized} binaries, one can still rule out certain parameter spaces of dark matter as being the dominant contributor to the matter budget of the Universe.</p>

<p>2024-10-21, <strong>Observational constraints on massive binaries</strong>, Tomer Shenar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16114v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.16114v1</a></p>

<p>Binary interactions are commonplace among massive stars, giving rise observed phenomena such as X-ray binaries, stripped stars &amp; supernovae, and gravitational-wave sources. The multiplicity properties of massive stars thus represent a fundamental observable to calibrate, test, and benchmark models of single-star and binary evolution. In these proceedings, I provide a modern summary of the observed properties of massive binaries across various metallicities, and discuss open problems in the field.</p>

<p>2024-10-21, <strong>Direct Measurements of Synchrotron-Emitting Electrons at Near-Sun Shocks</strong>, I. C. Jebaraj et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15933v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.15933v2</a></p>

<p>In this study, we present the first-ever direct measurements of synchrotron-emitting heliospheric traveling shocks, intercepted by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during its close encounters. Given that much of our understanding of powerful astrophysical shocks is derived from synchrotron radiation, these observations by PSP provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore how shocks accelerate relativistic electrons and the conditions under which they emit radiation. The probe’s unparalleled capabilities to measure both electromagnetic fields and energetic particles with high precision in the near-Sun environment has allowed us to directly correlate the distribution of relativistic electrons with the resulting photon emissions. Our findings reveal that strong quasi-parallel shocks emit radiation at significantly higher intensities than quasi-perpendicular shocks due to the efficient acceleration of ultra-relativistic electrons. These experimental results are consistent with theory and recent observations of supernova remnant shocks and advance our understanding of shock physics across diverse space environments.</p>

<p>2024-10-21, <strong>Detectability of Supernova Remnants with the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory</strong>, Nick Scharrer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15741v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.15741v1</a></p>

<p>Supernova remnants (SNRs) remain prime candidates for hadronic particle acceleration within our galaxy, accounting for much of the Cosmic Ray flux. Next-generation instruments such as the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) will be of crucial importance in identifying new candidate SNRs. SWGO will observe two-thirds of the gamma-ray sky, covering the energy range between a few hundreds GeV and a PeV. In this work, we apply a model of SNR evolution to predict their gamma-ray spectra. Furthermore, we use our model in combination with the target SWGO sensitivity range to explore the SNR emission phase space and quantify detection prospects for SWGO. Finally, we validate our model for sources observed with current-generation instruments, fitting it using a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain technique to the observed gamma-ray emission from four SNRs. We anticipate that at least 8 SNRs will be detected by SWGO within 1 year.</p>

<p>2024-10-21, <strong>Investigating Unusual H$α$ Features towards the Scutum Supershell</strong>, R. Alsulami et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15712v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2410.15712v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the unusual H$\alpha$ features found towards the Scutum Supershell via recent arc-minute and arc-second resolution imaging. These multi-degree features resemble a long central spine ending in a bow-shock morphology. We performed a multi-wavelength study in [SII] optical, radio continuum, infrared continuum, HI, CO, X-ray and gamma-ray emissions. Interestingly, we found the Galactic worm GW16.9$-$3.8 HI feature appears within the Scutum Supershell, and likely influences the spine morphology. Furthermore, the rightmost edge of the bow-shock H$\alpha$ emission overlaps with [S II] line emission, 4.85 GHz radio, and both 60$\mu$m and 100$\mu$m infrared continuum emissions, suggesting some potential for excitation by shock heating. We estimated the photo-ionisation from O-type and B-type stars in the region (including those from the OB associations Ser OB1B, Ser OB2 and Sct OB3) and found that this mechanism could supply the excitation to account for the observed H$\alpha$ luminosity of the spine and bow-shock of $\sim$1e36 - 2e36 erg/s (d/2.5 kpc)$^2$. Recent MHD simulations by Drozdov et al. (2022) demonstrate the potential for supernova events to drive outflow and bow-shock types of features of the same energetic nature and physical scale as the H$\alpha$ emission we observe here. While this clearly requires many supernova events over time, we speculate that one contributing event could have come from the presumably energetic supernova (hypernova) birth of the magnetar tentatively identified in the X-ray binary LS 5039.</p>
