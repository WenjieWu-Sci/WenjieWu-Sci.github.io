<p>2025-10-30, <strong>Study of neutrino spin oscillations in a gravitational field with a differential equations method</strong>, Mridupawan Deka et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26621v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26621v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we employ Ordinary Differential Equation solution method to study neutrino spin oscillations in the case when they are gravitationally scattered off a rotating Kerr black hole. Previously, this problem involved the integral solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We analyze the consistency of these two methods.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>The signals of doomsday II: Cosmological signatures of late time $SU(3)_c$ symmetry breaking</strong>, Amartya Sengupta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26267v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26267v1</a></p>

<p>The only two gauge symmetries which remain unbroken today are $SU(3)_c$ and $U(1)_{EM}$. Both of them are crucial for our universe to appear the way it does, and for our form of life to exist. Unless we are very special observers living at the very end of the cosmological symmetry breaking chain, there is no reason to believe that these two symmetries will remain unbroken in the future. In this paper, we discuss cosmological observational signatures of the $SU(3)_c$ symmetry breaking. We introduce a model with a new colored scalar field whose potential supports the first order phase transition through creation of the true vacuum bubbles. We then calculate particle production due to vacuum mismatch and use the event generators to study the decays of the new scalar field and massive gluons. We then use Pythia to hadronize the decay products and get the distributions of produced photons and neutrinos as the final result. They represent a long range signature which, if ever observed, might be interpreted as the signals of the doomsday.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>Letter of Intent: The Forward Physics Facility</strong>, Luis A. Anchordoqui et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26260v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26260v1</a></p>

<p>The Forward Physics Facility (FPF) is a proposed extension of the HL-LHC program designed to exploit the unique scientific opportunities offered by the intense flux of high energy neutrinos, and possibly new particles, in the far-forward direction. Located in a well-shielded cavern 627 m downstream of one of the LHC interaction points, the facility will support a broad and ambitious physics program that significantly expands the discovery potential of the HL-LHC. Equipped with four complementary detectors – FLArE, FASER$\nu$2, FASER2, and FORMOSA – the FPF will enable breakthrough measurements that will advance our understanding of neutrino physics, quantum chromodynamics, and astroparticle physics, and will search for dark matter and other new particles. With this Letter of Intent, we propose the construction of the FPF cavern and the construction, integration, and installation of its experiments. We summarize the physics case, the facility design, the layout and components of the detectors, as well as the envisioned collaboration structure, cost estimate, and implementation timeline.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>Testing the type-II seesaw mechanism with gravitational waves</strong>, Yonghua Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26235v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26235v1</a></p>

<p>Traditional seesaw mechanisms provide an elegant theoretical framework for explaining the small yet non-zero masses of neutrinos. Nevertheless, they face significant experimental challenges, primarily because the energy scale associated with the seesaw mechanism is too high to be directly probed in terrestrial experiments. In this paper, we explore the gravitational waves (GWs) generated via graviton bremsstrahlung during the decay of seesaw particles in the early Universe. Specifically, we compute the GW spectrum resulting from the decay of the Higgs triplet within the type-II seesaw model. Our results demonstrate that the resulting GW spectrum depends sensitively on the mass of the Higgs triplet and its couplings to the Standard Model Higgs doublet and the left-handed lepton doublet. The detection of such a high-frequency GW background could offer a unique experimental window into the seesaw mechanism and provide indirect evidence for its validity.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>Search for nucleon decay via $p\rightarrowνπ^{+}$ and $n\rightarrowνπ^{0}$ in 0.484 Mton-year of Super-Kamiokande data</strong>, Super-Kamiokande Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26232v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26232v1</a></p>

<p>We present the results of searches for nucleon decays via $p\rightarrow\nu\pi^{+}$ and $n\rightarrow\nu\pi^{0}$ using a 0.484 Mt$\cdot$yr exposure of Super-Kamiokande I-V data covering the entire pure water phase of the experiment. Various improvements on the previous 2014 nucleon decay search, which used an exposure of 0.173 Mt$\cdot$yr, are incorporated. The physics models related to pion production and nuclear interaction are refined with external data, and a more comprehensive set of systematic uncertainties, now including those associated with the atmospheric neutrino flux and pion production channels is considered. Also, the fiducial volume has been expanded by 21\%. No significant indication of a nucleon decay signal is found beyond the expected background. Lower bounds on the nucleon partial lifetimes are determined to be $3.5\times10^{32}$~yr for $p\rightarrow\nu\pi^{+}$ and $1.4\times10^{33}$~yr for $n\rightarrow\nu\pi^{0}$ at 90\% confidence level.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>KM3-230213A and IceCube Neutrino Events from Metastable Dark Matter of Primordial Black Hole Origin</strong>, Prabhav Singh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26126v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26126v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate a scenario in which the recently observed ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A, with a median energy of approximately 220 PeV, as well as the high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube Observatory, originate from the decay of superheavy dark matter (DM) particles produced through primordial black hole (PBH) evaporation. To establish this connection, we derive constraints on the PBH abundance parameter $\beta$ as a function of the initial PBH mass $M_{\mathrm{BH_0}}$ and DM mass $m_{\mathrm{DM}}$, by considering the bound from the observed relic DM abundance. Using these constraints, we compute the resulting neutrino flux and show that DM masses in the PeV-EeV range can yield neutrinos of comparable energies, capable of accounting for both the KM3-230213A and IceCube events while remaining consistent with the relic abundance constraint. Interestingly, the scenario remains viable over a broad region of parameter space while satisfying existing cosmological and astrophysical bounds. Overall, our results demonstrate that PBH evaporation followed by DM decay provides a consistent and natural explanation for the observed ultra-high-energy neutrino events in the absence of accompanying multimessenger signatures.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>Reconstruction of neutrino events in the Accelerator Neutrino Neutron Interaction Experiment: Part I</strong>, S. Abubakar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26050v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26050v1</a></p>

<p>The Accelerator Neutrino Neutron Interaction Experiment (ANNIE) was designed to reconstruct neutrino events from the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) with the parallel goals of measuring neutron production in interactions with oxygen and serving as a testbed for new technology. The ANNIE detector consists of a 26-ton water Cherenkov target tank instrumented with conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), a downstream tracking muon spectrometer, and an upstream double wall of plastic scintillator to serve to veto charged particles incoming from neutrino events that occur upstream of the experimental setup. ANNIE has also deployed multiple Large-Area Picosecond PhotoDetectors (LAPPDs) and a test vessel of water-based liquid scintillator (WbLS). This paper describes the event reconstruction performance of the detector before implementation of these novel technologies, which will serve as a baseline against which their impact can be measured. That said, even the techniques used for event reconstruction using only the conventional PMT array and muon spectrometer are significantly different than those used in other water Cherenkov detectors due to the small size of ANNIE (which makes nanosecond-scale timing not as useful as in a large detector) and the availability of reconstruction information from the tracking muon spectrometer. We demonstrate that combining the information from these two elements into a single fit using only pattern recognition yields a muon vertex uncertainty of 60 cm, a directional uncertainty of 13.2 degrees, and energy reconstruction uncertainty of about 10\% for BNB muon neutrino Charged Current Zero Pion (CC0pi) events.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>Boosting the cosmic 21-cm signal with exotic Lyman-$α$ from dark matter</strong>, Dominic Agius et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26791v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26791v1</a></p>

<p>The 21-cm signal from the epoch of cosmic dawn ($z \sim 10-30$) offers a powerful probe of new physics. One standard mechanism for constraining decaying dark matter from 21-cm observations relies on heating of the intergalactic medium by the decay products, an effect whose observability is entangled with the uncertain Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes and X-ray heating from the first stars. In this Letter, we explore a novel mechanism, where the Lyman-$\alpha$ photons produced from dark matter decay initiate early Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the spin temperature to the gas temperature, thereby boosting the 21-cm signal. This mechanism provides constraints on dark matter that are less dependent on uncertainties associated with star formation than constraints on exotic heating. We study this effect for decaying dark matter with masses $m_{\chi}\sim20.4-27.2$ eV, where diphoton decay efficiently produces Lyman-series photons. We present forecasts for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and the Square Kilometre Array, showing their potential to probe an unconstrained parameter space for light decaying DM, including axion-like particles.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>Vector dark matter with non-abelian kinetic mixing</strong>, Ana Luisa Foguel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26765v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26765v1</a></p>

<p>An appealing framework for dark matter is provided by light hidden sectors, below the electroweak scale, feebly coupled to the Standard Model via light mediators. We consider a minimal, predictive model where both the dark matter and the mediator are vector bosons, and have the same mass. The portal between the dark sector and the Standard Model is provided by a kinetic mixing between the dark gauge symmetry, $SU(2)_X$, and the hypercharge, $U(1)_Y$, induced by a dimension-six operator. The dark-matter candidates, $X^\pm$, are charged under a custodial symmetry and therefore stable, while the mediator is a massive dark photon, $Z_D$, mixing with the photon and the $Z$. We show how the observed dark-matter abundance can be reproduced via freeze-out or freeze-in, through either the kinetic mixing or the dark gauge interaction. We also analyse dark 3-to-2 annihilations, that can become dominant in model variations with $Z_D$ heavier than $X^\pm$. We confront our relic-density predictions with current and projected experimental, astrophysical and cosmological bounds on the model parameter space, highlighting the correlation between the dark-photon and dark-matter phenomenologies.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>Quantum Enhanced Dark-Matter Search with Entangled Fock States in High-Quality Cavities</strong>, Benjamin Freiman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26754v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26754v1</a></p>

<p>We present a quantum-enhanced protocol for detecting wave-like dark matter using an array of $N$ entangled superconducting cavities initialized in an $m$-photon Fock state. By distributing and recollecting the quantum state with an entanglement-distribution operation, the scan rate scales as $N^2(m+1)$ while thermal excitation is the dominant background, significantly outperforming classical single-cavity methods under matched conditions. We evaluate the robustness of our scheme against additional noise sources, including decoherence and beamsplitter infidelity, through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. In practice, the key requirements, namely high-Q superconducting radio-frequency cavities that support long integration times, high-fidelity microwave beamsplitters, and universal cavity control, are already available on current experimental platforms, making the protocol experimentally feasible.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>Wavefront Curvature and Transverse Atomic Motion in Time-Resolved Atom Interferometry: Impact and Mitigation</strong>, Noam Mouelle et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26739v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26739v1</a></p>

<p>Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms’ transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud’s centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>A New Probe for Long-Lived Particles at Higgs Factories: Displaced Photons in the Hadronic Calorimeter</strong>, Zhicheng Jiang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26649v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26649v1</a></p>

<p>The search for dark matter and other photon-portal long-lived particles (LLPs) at electron-positron colliders often relies on the mono-photon signature. At future Higgs factories operating at the $Z$-pole, this approach faces a critical challenge: the irreducible background from $e^+e^- \to \nu\bar{\nu}\gamma$ becomes overwhelming. We propose a novel strategy that overcomes this limitation by searching for displaced photons from LLP decays within the barrel of the hadronic calorimeter. This signature exploits the architectural shielding of the detector to create a nearly background-free environment. Our analysis demonstrates exceptional sensitivity to LLPs with decay lengths from $\sim$1 to $10^6$ meters, improving upon conventional searches by up to one order of magnitude for benchmark photon-portal models.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>Hybrid Physical-Neural Simulator for Fast Cosmological Hydrodynamics</strong>, Arne Thomsen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26593v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26593v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmological field-level inference requires differentiable forward models that solve the challenging dynamics of gas and dark matter under hydrodynamics and gravity. We propose a hybrid approach where gravitational forces are computed using a differentiable particle-mesh solver, while the hydrodynamics are parametrized by a neural network that maps local quantities to an effective pressure field. We demonstrate that our method improves upon alternative approaches, such as an Enthalpy Gradient Descent baseline, both at the field and summary-statistic level. The approach is furthermore highly data efficient, with a single reference simulation of cosmological structure formation being sufficient to constrain the neural pressure model. This opens the door for future applications where the model is fit directly to observational data, rather than a training set of simulations.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>A test of invariance of halo surface density for FIRE-2 simulations with cold dark matter and self-interacting dark matter</strong>, Sujit K. Dalui et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26545v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26545v1</a></p>

<p>Numerous observations have shown that the dark matter halo surface density, defined as the product of core radius and halo central density of cored dark matter haloes is nearly constant and independent of galaxy mass over a whole slew of galaxy types. Here we calculate the surface density in cold dark matter(CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models including baryons, as well as SIDM without baryons, for dwarf galaxies of masses $\approx 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ using mock catalogs obtained from simulations as part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments project. We find that the dark matter surface density and column density are nearly constant for CDM and SIDM for this mass range. The halo surface density obtained from the Burkert profile fit is consistent with galactic-scale observations within $1\sigma$. We also computed the empirical scaling relations between the central surface density and maximum velocity using the best-fit dark matter profiles, and found that they agree with observations of Milky Way and M31 dwarfs.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>Weak-Lensing Detection of Intercluster Filaments in Three Nearby Cluster Systems</strong>, Rahul Shinde et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26318v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26318v1</a></p>

<p>Direct detection of intercluster filaments is challenging due to their low surface density, resulting in a weak deflection field. We present weak-lensing detections of intercluster filaments using wide-field Dark Energy Camera (DECam) observations from the Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS). A matched-filter method was applied to identify filamentary structures in three nearby ($z &lt; 0.1$) systems centered on Abell 401, Abell 2029, and Abell 3558. We discover two prominent filaments ($\geq 4\sigma$) in each system, with the strongest detections ($6.4\sigma - 7.3\sigma$) around Abell 401 and Abell 2029. In particular, we report the first robust weak-lensing detections $(&gt;5 \sigma)$ of the intercluster bridges connecting the cluster pairs Abell 401/399, Abell 2029/2033, Abell 2029/SIG, and Abell 3558/3556. Adopting a filament convergence model motivated by numerical simulations, we infer the maximum convergence ($\kappa_0$) and characteristic width ($h_{\mathrm{c}}$) for all six filaments, yielding $\kappa_0 \sim 0.015 - 0.053$ and $h_{\mathrm{c}} \sim 0.11 - 0.45 \ \mathrm{Mpc}$. The performance of the matched-filter technique is validated using mock shear catalogs and further tested on a null field around Abell 2351. We also explore the potential of using the B-mode lensing signal of filaments to suppress cluster-induced shear contamination. These results demonstrate the feasibility of directly mapping dark matter filaments with current and future wide-field weak-lensing datasets.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>Searching for the X17 with the PADME experiment</strong>, V. Kozhuharov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26258v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26258v1</a></p>

<p>The PADME experiment was originally designed to test dark matter theories predicting the existence of a ‘‘Dark Sector’’ composed of particles that interact with Standard Model ones exclusively through the exchange of a new, massive mediator. The confirmation of the X17 anomaly, observed in nuclear decays at the ATOMKI in Debrecen, sparked considerable interest in the particle physics community. If the anomaly arises from the decay of a new state into an $e^+e^-$ pair,the time-reversal symmetry implies that it must be also producible through $e^+e^-$ annihilation. The PADME experiment can rely on the world’s only e+ beam with the appropriate energy for a resonant production of X17. The collaboration dedicated 2022 data taking to investigate the X17 anomaly via $e^+e^- \to X17 \to e^+e^-$ reaction, aiming to probe the particle hypothesis. An overview of the scientific program of the experiment and the present status of the search for X17 at PADME are presented.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>A Triple-GEM Time Projection Chamber for Wide Field-of-View Hard X-ray Polarimetry: First Results</strong>, Davide Fiorina et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26239v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26239v1</a></p>

<p>We report on the development of a large-volume, wide field-of-view time projection chamber (TPC) for X-ray polarimetry, featuring a triple-GEM amplification stage and optical readout. Originally developed within the CYGNO program for directional dark matter searches, the system employs a scientific CMOS (sCMOS) camera and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) to collect secondary scintillation light produced during charge amplification. A prototype with a cylindrical active volume (radius 3.7 cm, height 5 cm) was tested at the INAF–IAPS calibration facility (Rome, Tor Vergata) to assess sensitivity to low-energy electron directionality. We fully reconstruct electrons in the 10-60 keV range, obtain angular resolutions as good as 15{\deg}, and infer modulation factors up to 0.9. These first results demonstrate robust photoelectron tracking at tens of keV with strong modulation, indicating that photoelectric-effect polarimetry can be extended to higher energies. This capability is promising for rapid transients (GRBs, solar flares) and would broaden the astrophysical reach of X-ray polarimetry.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>The Weighing Halos Accurately, Locally, and Efficiently with Supernovae (WHALES) Survey Overview and Initial Data Release</strong>, Maria Acevedo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26731v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26731v1</a></p>

<p>We present an overview of the Weighing Halos Accurately, Locally, and Efficiently with Supernovae (WHALES) survey, the first to discover and measure Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in and around galaxy superclusters. By building a sample of SNe~Ia around these massive environments, we aim to provide new constraints on bulk-flow models while laying the groundwork for improved estimates of supercluster masses. Here, we present data from the first two seasons targeting the Shapley Supercluster (0.02&lt;z&lt;0.06), which is responsible for a large but unknown fraction of our local group’s motion. Until now, no supernovae had been analyzed in the direction of Shapley. Through the WHALES survey, we have identified 12 likely SNe Ia in this region using SkyMapper, including 8 with spectroscopic confirmation. We present the first light curves of these SNe and combine our observations with data from ATLAS. We demonstrate that the low number of discovered SNe Ia per season is consistent with various rate calculations, highlighting the need for future surveys to monitor superclusters over a multi-year timespan. Finally, we present simulations of SN Ia observations in the environments of massive galaxy clusters, demonstrating how the inferred peculiar velocities can constrain cluster masses, and highlighting the added complexity within superclusters. We find that a sample of 100 SNe Ia would enable a 25% precision measurement of the total mass of the Shapley Supercluster.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>The chemical DNA of the Magellanic Clouds IV. Unveiling extreme element production: the Eu abundance in the Small Magellanic Cloud</strong>, Samuele Anoardo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26625v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26625v1</a></p>

<p>In this study we investigate the chemical enrichment of the rapid neutron-capture process in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We measure [Eu/Fe] abundance ratios in 209 giant stars that are confirmed members of the SMC, providing the first extensive dataset of Eu abundances in this galaxy across its full metallicity range, spanning more than 1.5 dex. We compare Eu abundances with those of Mg and Ba to evaluate the efficiency of the r-process relative to $\alpha$-capture and s-process nucleosynthesis. The SMC shows enhanced [Eu/Fe] values at all metallicities (comparable with the values measured in the Milky Way), with a clear decline as [Fe/H] increases (from $\sim$ -1.75 dex to $\sim$ -0.5 dex), consistent with the onset of Type Ia supernovae. In contrast, [Eu/Mg] is enhanced by about +0.5 dex at all [Fe/H], significantly above the values observed in Milky Way stars, where [Eu/Mg] remains close to solar, reflecting comparable production of r-process and $\alpha$-capture elements. Moreover, [Ba/Eu] increases with metallicity, beginning at [Fe/H] $\approx$ -1.5 dex, namely at a lower metallicity with respect to the Milky Way, where [Ba/Eu] starts to increase around [Fe/H] $\approx$ -1 dex. Our findings suggest the SMC has a higher production of Eu (with respect to the $\alpha$-elements) than the Milky Way but in line with what observed in other dwarf systems within the Local Group. We confirm that galaxies with star formation efficiencies lower than the Milky Way have high [Eu/$\alpha$], probably indicating a stronger efficiency of the delayed sources of r-process at low metallicities.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>The magnetic fields of the dusty nuclei and molecular outflows of Arp 220</strong>, Enrique Lopez-Rodriguez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26570v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26570v1</a></p>

<p>Galaxy mergers trigger starburst activity and galactic outflows that enrich the circumgalactic medium, profoundly impacting galaxy evolution. These phenomena are intrinsically linked to the physical conditions of the medium, which is permeated by magnetic (B) fields affecting its transport and dynamics. Here, we spatially resolve, $0.24$” (96 pc), the B-fields in the dusty and molecular outflows of Arp 220, the closest ($78$ Mpc) Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxy hosting two interacting nuclei, denoted as East and West. We perform ALMA $870~\mu$m dust continuum polarization and CO(3-2) emission line polarization, and report the first detection of CO(3-2) emission line polarization through the Goldreich-Kylafis effect in an outflow. Dust polarization shows that Arp 220 E has a spiral-like B-field on the disk with a linear polarization fraction of $0.4\pm0.1$% that may produce the detected circular polarization passing through foreground aligned dust grains. Arp 220 W reveals a B-field parallel to the red- and blueshifted outflows in both the dust and emission line polarization maps. The outflows show a dust polarization of $0.2$%, while the CO(3-2) emission line polarization is $1-2$% at $4-6\sigma$ significance across independent velocity channels. A highly polarized ($3-5$%) dusty bridge has a B-field orientation of $\sim110^{\circ}$ connecting both nuclei. Mean B-field strengths of $1.6$ mG and $8$ mG for the blue- and redshifted outflows, respectively, are estimated. These strong B-fields are attributed to amplification by compression in nuclear clouds and supernova remnants. This amplified B-field is likely sustained by the turbulent kinetic energy in the outflow and may be critical in directing the transport of metals and cosmic rays into the circumgalactic medium.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>CROCODILE-DWARF: Assembly and Kinematics of Field Dwarf Galaxies with GADGET4-OSAKA</strong>, Kazuki Tomaru et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26513v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26513v1</a></p>

<p>We present results from CROCODILE-DWARF, a suite of cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of isolated field dwarf galaxies with halo masses of $\sim10^{10}\,M_\odot$ at $z=0$, performed with the \textsc{gadget4-osaka} code. The simulations include detailed modeling of star formation, chemical enrichment, and supernova feedback using the \textsc{CELib} and \textsc{grackle} libraries, achieving baryonic resolutions of $\sim2\times10^3\,M_\odot$. Our study focuses on how assembly history governs the structural and kinematic diversity of dwarf galaxies within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. The simulated galaxies reproduce the observed stellar-to-halo mass, mass–metallicity, and size–mass relations, yielding stellar masses of $10^6-10^8\,M_\odot$ and metallicities consistent with those of Local Group dwarf galaxies. The galaxies display a broad range of rotational support, where gas is generally more rotationally supported than stars. Differences in morphology and kinematics primarily reflect variations in halo assembly timescales and merger activity. Early-assembling, high-concentration halos form stars efficiently and become gas-poor by $z=0$, while late-assembling, low-concentration halos remain gas-rich due to delayed star formation and rejuvenated gas accretion. We identify a clear anti-correlation between rotational support and the cumulative merger mass fraction, demonstrating that dynamical heating by mergers is the dominant factor shaping kinematic diversity. In some cases, late-time mergers induce the formation of extended gas disks by delivering fresh gas and angular momentum. These results demonstrate that assembly history, rather than halo mass alone, critically shapes the present-day kinematic and morphological diversity of dwarf galaxies.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>Model-independent late-universe measurements of $H_0$ and $Ω_\mathrm{K}$ with the PAge-improved inverse distance ladder</strong>, Guo-Hong Du et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26355v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26355v1</a></p>

<p>The standard $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model has encountered serious challenges and the $H_0$ tension has become more significant with increasingly precise cosmological observation. Meanwhile, inconsistencies in measurements of the curvature parameter $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ between different datasets also have emerged. In this work, we employ two global and cosmic age-based parameterizations, PAge and MAPAge, to perform model-independent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ by utilizing the inverse distance ladder (IDL). To construct the PAge-improved IDL, we utilize the strong gravitational lensing (SGL), cosmic chronometers (CC), and gamma ray bursts (GRB) data to calibrate the latest DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation data and DESY5 type Ia supernova data. Our analysis indicate that DESI+DESY5+SGL+CC+GRB gives $H_0=71.59\pm 0.94\,{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ in the MAPAge model, reducing the $H_0$ tension to the $1.0\sigma$ level. Extending to MAPAge$+\Omega_{\rm K}$ model, we obtain $\Omega_\mathrm{K}=0.001\pm 0.038$, which suggests that current late-time data are consistent with a flat universe. Finally, the Bayesian analysis indicates that the present late-universe data provide weak to moderate evidence in favor of PAge and MAPAge relative to $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>Direct Numerical Simulations of Oxygen-Flame-Driven Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition in Type Ia Supernovae</strong>, Xiaoyu Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26152v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26152v1</a></p>

<p>We present direct numerical simulations demonstrating deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) driven by oxygen flames in Type Ia supernova progenitors. Using the Castro hydrodynamics code coupled with the ``aprox13’’ 13-isotope nuclear network, we simulate combustion in isolated fuel regions where oxygen flames trail carbon flames. In a fiducial one-dimensional run at $\rho_{0}=3.5\times10^{7}\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$ we observe spontaneous DDT of the oxygen flame via the Zel’dovich gradient mechanism when the carbon-oxygen separation reaches $\sim 10\ \mathrm{km}$. The oxygen detonation then captures the carbon flame and triggers a stable carbon detonation. Systematic one-dimensional parameter scans show that successful carbon DDT requires upstream densities in the range $(3.1$–$3.6)\times10^{7}\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$ and a minimum carbon-flame thickness of $\gtrsim 20\ \mathrm{m}$. Two-dimensional simulations confirm DDT and demonstrate that the multidimensional cellular structure of the oxygen detonation can promote carbon detonation at somewhat lower densities than in one dimension. These results provide direct numerical evidence that oxygen-flame-driven DDT is physically plausible in turbulent white-dwarf environments and underscore the importance of multidimensional effects for Type Ia supernova explosion modeling.</p>

<p>2025-10-30, <strong>Evidence of cosmic-ray acceleration up to sub-PeV energies in the supernova remnant IC 443</strong>, Zhen Cao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26112v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.26112v1</a></p>

<p>Supernova remnants (SNRs) have been considered as the primary contributors to cosmic rays (CRs) in our Galaxy. However, the maximum energy of particles that can be accelerated by shocks of SNRs is uncertain observationally and theoretically, and the role of contribution to CRs around PeV energies by SNRs is unclear. In this study, we present observations of high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from the SNR IC 443 using the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). The morphological analysis reveals a pointlike source whose location and spectrum are consistent with those of the Fermi-LAT-detected compact source with $\pi^0$-decay signature, and a more extended source which is consistent with a newly discovered source, previously unrecognized by Fermi-LAT. The spectrum of the point source can be described by a power-law function with an index of $\sim3.0$, extending beyond $\sim 30$ TeV without apparent cutoff. Assuming a hadronic origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission, the $95\%$ lower limit of accelerated protons reaches about 300 TeV. The extended source might be coincident with IC 443, SNR G189.6+3.3 or the putative pulsar wind nebula CXOU J061705.3+222127, and can be explained by either a hadronic or leptonic model. The LHAASO results provide compelling evidence that CR protons up to sub-PeV energies can be accelerated by the SNR.</p>
