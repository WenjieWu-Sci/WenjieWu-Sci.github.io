<p>2026-02-12, <strong>GPU-Accelerated Analytic Simulation of Sparse Signals in Pixelated Time Projection Detector</strong>, Yousen Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12052v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.12052v1</a></p>

<p>This paper presents a GPU-accelerated simulation package,   TRED, for next-generation neutrino detectors with pixelated   charge readout, leveraging community-driven software ecosystems to   ensure sustainability and extensibility. We introduce two generic   contributions: (i) an effective-charge calculation based on Gaussian   quadrature rules for numerical integration, and (ii) a sparse,   block-binned tensor representation that enables efficient FFT-based   computation of induced signals on readout electrodes for sparsely   activated detector volumes. The former captures sub-grid structure   without requiring dense sampling, while the latter achieves low   memory usage and scalable runtime, as demonstrated in benchmark   studies. The underlying data representation is applicable to   large-scale detectors and to other computational problems involving   sparse activity.</p>

<p>The NOvA experiment’s most recent search for eV-scale sterile neutrinos under a 3+1 model simultaneously analyses muon neutrino and neutral current datasets from the NuMI beam at its Near ($\sim$\qty{1}{km} baseline) and Far (\qty{810}{km} baseline) detectors to look for oscillations consistent with a sterile neutrino. The analysis is systematically limited in the region of parameter space where $Δm^2_{41} \gtrsim 1~\mathrm{eV}^2$. This region of parameter space is preferred by sterile neutrino interpretations of current experimental anomalies and so improving sensitivity here is high-priority. These proceedings present our current search strategy, and discusses future plans to include data from a second beamline, the Booster Neutrino Beam, to improve our sensitivity in systematics-dominated regions of parameter space.</p>

<p>2026-02-11, <strong>Demonstration and performance of an online data selection algorithm for liquid argon time projection chambers using MicroBooNE</strong>, MicroBooNE collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11138v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.11138v1</a></p>

<p>The MicroBooNE detector is a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) that produces three-dimensional images of particle interactions using ionization charge collected by anode wire plane arrays and scintillation light collected by a light detection system. In addition to testing long-standing experimental neutrino anomalies and performing measurements of neutrino interactions with argon nuclei using the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam, MicroBooNE aims to develop methodologies for rare beyond the Standard Model and off-beam physics searches. Looking ahead to the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), with MicroBooNE serving as a valuable testbed, achieving high sensitivity and livetime for off-beam physics while satisfying data processing and storage constraints will require data-driven, intelligent, and online or real-time data selection techniques. These techniques are essential for reducing data rates and preserving rare signals with high accuracy. In this paper, we describe a fast data selection algorithm suitable for online execution to identify electrons from stopping cosmic ray muons in the MicroBooNE detector utilizing ionization charge information, and present its performance. This represents the first demonstration of online data selection in a LArTPC using real data and charge information exclusively and provides an important proof-of-principle for applying such techniques to other LArTPC experiments such as the Short-Baseline Near Detector and DUNE.</p>

<p>2026-02-11, <strong>Sterile neutrino dark matter in conformal Majoron models</strong>, João Gonçalves et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11085v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.11085v1</a></p>

<p>We study sterile neutrino dark matter (DM) in a classically conformal U(1)’ extension of the Standard Model with three right-handed neutrinos and a Majoron-like singlet scalar that generate the observed pattern of active neutrino masses and mixing via the type-I seesaw mechanism. Working in the regime of strongly suppressed active-sterile mixing, we show that the observed DM abundance can be produced through freeze-in from feeble interactions mediated by the heavy Z’ and the conformal scalar. We solve the Boltzmann equation for the nonthermal phase-space distribution and confront the scenario with Lyman-$α$ data by computing the matter power spectrum. For keV-scale sterile neutrinos we identify the viable parameter space consistent with structure-formation and X-ray bounds, including regions compatible with a tentative 3.5 keV line. If a second sterile state is long-lived, late decays can realize a two-component setup that alleviates the $S_8$ tension. In a highly fine-tuned variant of the model, the 220 PeV KM3NeT event can also be explained by invoking the decay of a superheavy sterile neutrino.</p>

<p>2026-02-11, <strong>Application of a high-precision distributed uranium source for determining the effective mass and volume of a HPGe detector</strong>, A. S. Barabash et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10759v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.10759v1</a></p>

<p>A distributed uranium source with the accurately certified activity of 238U has been used to verify the effective mass of the HPGe detector intended for the νGeN neutrino experiment. The source, dissolved in nitric acid, provides homogeneous irradiation of the detector crystal allowing the study of its mass and volume. The experimental spectra obtained with the distributed source have been compared to the detailed Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations. The measured counting rates of several gamma-lines agree with the simulated efficiencies, confirming that the detector mass and volume coincide with the manufacturer specifications. The results demonstrate the applicability of such sources for mass calibration of HPGe detectors.</p>

<p>2026-02-12, <strong>Systematic Operator Construction for Non-relativistic Effective Field Theories: Hilbert Series versus Young Tensor</strong>, Yong-Kang Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12263v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.12263v1</a></p>

<p>This work establishes a systematic framework for operator construction in the non-relativistic effective field theory, incorporating both the three dimensional Euclidean symmetry and the internal symmetries. By employing double cover of the rotation group, we extend the Hilbert series to the non-relativistic systems, and eliminates redundancies introduced by the spin operator. We also generalize the Young tensor method to the non-relativistic cases through the $SU(2)$ semi-standard Young tableaux, which allows for the construction of operator bases with repeated fields at any given mass dimension. Utilizing the Young tensor technique and Hibert series as cross-check, we obtain the complete operator bases for the following cases: heavy particle (and also heavy quark) effective theory operators up to mass dimension 9; pion-less effective theory operators, including nucleon-nucleon contact interactions up to $\mathcal{O}(Q^4)$ and three-nucleon interactions at $\mathcal{O}(Q^2)$; and finally the spin-1/2 dark matter-nucleon operators up to $\mathcal{O}(v^4)$.</p>

<p>2026-02-12, <strong>Resurrecting Kaluza-Klein Dark Matter with Low-Temperature Reheating</strong>, Kirtiman Ghosh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12154v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.12154v1</a></p>

<p>In Universal Extra Dimension (UED) scenarios, the lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) particle is naturally stable due to a remnant discrete symmetry, KK parity, arising from extra-dimensional compactification. This stability requires no ad hoc symmetry and renders Kaluza-Klein dark matter a well-motivated candidate, provided it reproduces the observed relic abundance. The minimal UED (mUED) framework being highly predictive is strongly constrained by the combined requirements of relic density and collider searches under standard cosmological assumptions. We revisit the dark matter phenomenology of mUED in the presence of a nonstandard cosmological history featuring a low reheating temperature driven by prolonged inflaton decay. Solving the coupled Boltzmann equations for dark matter, radiation, and inflaton energy densities, we show that entropy injection during reheating can dilute the relic abundance by orders of magnitude, reopening large regions of parameter space previously ruled out. We further demonstrate that the revived parameter space is consistent with current collider, direct-detection, and indirect-detection constraints, while remaining testable by upcoming experiments.</p>

<p>2026-02-12, <strong>Search for Sub-Solar Mass Binaries in the First Part of LIGO’s Fourth Observing Run</strong>, Keisi Kacanja et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12115v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.12115v1</a></p>

<p>We report the first results of a sub-solar mass compact binary search using the data from the first part of the fourth observing run (O4a) of the Advanced LIGO detectors. Sub-solar mass neutron stars or primordial black holes are not expected to form via standard stellar evolution, and their observation would signify a new class of astrophysical object or the discovery of dark matter. Our search covers binaries with primary masses 0.1 to 2 $\textrm{M}_\odot$ and secondary masses 0.1 to 1 $\textrm{M}_\odot$. We explicitly incorporate tidal effects up to $7\times10^5$ for extremely low mass neutron stars. No statistically significant candidates are identified. The advanced sensitivity of the O4a run enables an improvement in the sub-solar mass black hole merger rate limits by more than $2 \times$ over the previous three observing runs (O1-O3b). We place a $90\%$ confidence upper limit on the merger rate $\mathcal{R}_{90}$ for sub-solar mass black holes to be $&lt; 1.77\times10^4 \textrm{Gpc}^{-3} \textrm{yr}^{-1}$ for a chirp mass of 0.2 $\textrm{M}_\odot$. We place the first constraints for binary neutron stars with tidal deformabilities up to $\sim 7\times10^5$ and improve the merger rate estimate by a factor $\sim 4$ in comparison to previous O3 tidal searches for tidal deformabilities $&lt; 10^4$. We further constrain the fraction of dark matter composed of primordial black hole $f_{\rm PBH}&lt; 2\%$ for a chirp mass of 0.1 $\textrm{M}_\odot$. Our results significantly expand the observational search space for sub-solar binaries and provide rigorous constraints on the local abundance of compact objects that may arise from non-standard formation mechanisms.</p>

<p>2026-02-12, <strong>Dark matter distributions around extreme mass ratio inspirals: effects of radial pressure and relativistic treatment</strong>, Yang Zhao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12022v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.12022v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate different treatments of dark matter (DM) distributions surrounding extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) to assess their impact on orbital evolution and gravitational wave emission. Density profiles derived from the mass current and from the energy-momentum tensor using a distribution function yield consistent results, but both differ substantially from profiles obtained using an anisotropic fluid model based on Einstein cluster ansatz. We find that the inclusion of radial pressure significantly modifies both the orbital dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave waveforms. By analyzing waveform dephasing and mismatches, we show that a fully relativistic treatment of DM distributions can substantially alter the detectability thresholds of DM halos. Our results demonstrate that radial pressure and relativistic modeling of DM are essential for accurately describing the dynamics and observational signatures of EMRIs embedded in DM halos.</p>

<p>2026-02-12, <strong>Is cosmic birefringence due to dark energy or dark matter? Simulation-based inference</strong>, Florie Carralot et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12019v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.12019v1</a></p>

<p>Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a powerful inference technique for cases where the exact functional form of the likelihood is not known. A prime example is the likelihood of cross-correlation power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fields at low multipoles, $\ell\lesssim 10$. In this paper, we investigate a parity-violating cross-correlation between $E$- and $B$- mode polarization fields using SBI. The $EB$ correlation at low $\ell$ is essential to distinguish between possible axion dark energy and dark matter interpretations of `cosmic birefringence’, a rotation of the plane of linear polarization of the CMB, recently reported from WMAP, Planck, and Atacama Cosmology Telescope data. We use neural likelihood estimation to infer the likelihood of the $EB$ correlation at low $\ell$ and show that it is highly non-Gaussian. We then employ neural posterior estimation to constrain the scalar field mass ($m_φ$), the cosmic birefringence amplitude ($gφ_\mathrm{in}/2$), and the instrumental miscalibration angle ($α$), from simulated datasets. We find that the posterior on $m_φ$ shows two regimes, with a transition marked by $10^{-32}$ eV, highlighting a strong sensitivity to the scale dependence of cosmic birefringence. To quantify this behavior, we compute the probability $p(m_φ &lt; 10^{-32}$\,eV) for various fiducial values of $m_φ$. We find that $α$ and the contribution of lensed $B$ modes ultimately limit our ability to exclude the dark energy scenario fully.</p>

<p>2026-02-12, <strong>Subaru High-$z$ Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs). XXV. Large-scale environments of low-luminosity quasars at $z\sim6$ traced by Ly$α$ emitters</strong>, Junya Arita et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11736v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.11736v1</a></p>

<p>High-$z$ quasars are believed to reside in massive dark matter haloes (DMHs), suggesting that they reside in galaxy overdense regions. However, previous observations have shown a range of environments around them. The previous targets are limited to bright quasars ($M_{1450}\lesssim-25$), for which photoevaporation may hinder galaxy formation in their vicinity. Here, we present Subaru/Hyper-Suprime Cam observations of the environments of four low-luminosity quasars ($-24&lt;M_{1450}&lt;-22$) at $z\sim6.18$, which are expected to have a smaller photoevaporation effect. We detect Lyman $α$ emitters (LAEs) around them with narrowband NB872 imaging, and measure the local LAE overdensity. One quasar (J0844$-$0132) resides in an overdense region ($δ_\mathrm{LAE}=3.77\pm0.97$), whereas the other three fields are consistent with normal fields. The result is confirmed over the proximity zone of each quasar, suggesting that the diverse environment around quasars is independent of photoevaporation. We find no significant correlation between the LAE overdensities and the properties of host galaxies and supermassive black holes. Our quasars have host stellar mass measurements from JWST, allowing us to compare them with the LAE overdensity around galaxies without quasar activity with comparable stellar masses. We find that the LAE overdensity in the J0844$-$0132 field is stronger than that of galaxies with similar stellar mass at $z\sim6$, while the other quasar fields show a comparable LAE overdensity.</p>

<p>2026-02-12, <strong>Probing mixed-state dark matter and $b \to s μ^+μ^-$ anomalies in a scalar-assisted baryonic gauge theory</strong>, Taramati et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11571v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.11571v1</a></p>

<p>We explore a Standard Model extension based on a local $U(1)_B$ symmetry, where a baryon-charged scalar mediates interactions between a fermionic dark matter candidate and Standard Model quarks. In this setup, the dark matter relic abundance is shaped not only by standard annihilation channels but also by additional coannihilation processes induced by a new scalar. The presence of this mediator provides a unified link between dark sector and flavor physics, yielding distinctive phenomenological consequences. We conduct a detailed study of dark matter phenomenology, emphasizing the role of the mass splitting between the dark matter particles, and the scalar mediator in determining the efficiency of coannihilation. The parameter space is examined in light of existing constraints from cosmological observations, direct and indirect detection experiments, as well as the collider searches at the \texttt{LHC}. Our analysis shows that the extended scalar sector opens up viable regions of parameter space beyond those accessible in minimal (U(1)_B) realizations, many of which are expected to be tested by forthcoming searches at \texttt{XENONnT} and \texttt{CTA}. Moreover, the model induces correlated signatures from flavor observables associated with the $b \to s μ^+ μ^-$ transitions as well, serving as complementary tests of the underlying framework.</p>

<p>2026-02-12, <strong>Stone Skipping Black Holes in Ultralight Dark Matter Solitons</strong>, Alan Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11512v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.11512v1</a></p>

<p>The orbit of a black hole moving within an ultralight dark matter (ULDM) soliton is naively expected to decay due to dynamical friction. However, single black holes can undergo ``stone skipping’’, with their orbital radius varying quasi-periodically. We show that stone skipping is induced by the dipole excitation of the soliton. We model it as resonance in a forced, damped harmonic oscillator, demonstrating that the coherent response of the soliton can significantly modify the dynamics of objects orbiting within it. This suggests that a dipole perturbation of a soliton can modify inspiral timescales if the black holes masses are significantly less than the soliton mass, with implications for supermassive black hole dynamics, the final parsec problem and gravitational wave observations in a ULDM cosmology.</p>

<p>2026-02-11, <strong>Linear Growth of Matter Perturbations Probed by Redshift-Space Distortions in Interacting $Λ(t)$CDM Cosmologies</strong>, A. A. Escobal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11310v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.11310v1</a></p>

<p>In the context of a spatially flat $Λ(t)$CDM cosmology, we investigate interacting dark energy (IDE) scenarios characterized by phenomenological interaction terms proportional to the Hubble expansion rate and the dark energy density. Our analysis is performed at both the background and linear perturbation levels, with particular emphasis on the evolution of dark matter density fluctuations. Cosmological constraints are derived from a joint analysis of CMB distance priors, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from Pantheon+, Redshift-Space Distortions (RSD), and $H(z)$ data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC). Using the linear growth of matter perturbations, we estimate the clustering parameter $S_8$ within IDE extensions of the flat $Λ(t)$CDM framework. At the perturbative level, we consider interaction terms of the form $Q_{\text{I}}=\varepsilon a H\barρ_{Λ(t)}$ (Model I) and $Q_{\text{II}}=\varepsilon H\barρ_{Λ(t)}$ (Model II). From the combined dataset, we obtain the constraints $S_8 = 0.870 \pm 0.026$ for Model I and $S_8 = 0.872 \pm 0.026$ for Model II. Finally, we discuss the implications for the coupling parameter $\varepsilon$, taking into account the semi-analytical approximations and observational data employed in this study.</p>

<p>2026-02-11, <strong>Tailored mass estimators for Milky Way dwarf Spheroidals</strong>, Sofia L. Splawska et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11273v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.11273v1</a></p>

<p>Assuming spherical symmetry and dynamical equilibrium within a given gravitational potential, a dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy’s globally averaged stellar velocity dispersion depends entirely on the shape of its stellar density profile. Thus, the dynamical inference of a dSph’s gravitational potential is necessarily sensitive to assumptions about that shape. Relaxing standard assumptions, we fit flexible stellar density models to observations of the Milky Way’s known dSph satellites. Considering various choices for the density profile shape and spatial extent of a host dark matter halo, we use the virial theorem to propagate observational uncertainties about the shapes of the inferred dSph stellar density profiles to uncertainties in the inferred dynamical masses. We find that the observed structural diversity of the Milky Way dSph population implies a large range of potential systematic errors (up to factors of 10) associated with standard dynamical mass estimators. We show that accounting for these observational and systematic uncertainties can significantly alter the appearance and behavior of dSph dynamical scaling relations, including enclosed dynamical mass vs. stellar mass and the Radial Acceleration Relation.</p>

<p>The early universe grants access to energy scales far beyond those achievable in terrestrial experiments and allows unstable Standard Model particles to play an active dynamical role. In this contribution, we focus on recent studies aimed at quantifying the potential of the early universe to probe the properties and interactions of axions. The discussion is organized around four classes of axion scenarios, ordered from long to short lifetimes: (i) stable or long-lived axions contributing to dark radiation; (ii) stable or long-lived axions produced out-of-equilibrium and constituting dark matter; (iii) metastable axions whose decays inject energy into the primordial plasma and leave observable signatures in the global 21 cm signal; and (iv) very short-lived axions that act only as portals to additional degrees of freedom. Together, these scenarios highlight the interplay between axion phenomenology and early universe cosmology and demonstrate the potential of cosmological data to probe axions over a broad range of masses and lifetimes.</p>

<p>The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), NASA’s next flagship science mission, follows in the tradition of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and other preceding great observatories. HWO will directly image and characterize Earth-like exoplanet and their atmospheres, with the capability to detect biosignatures and potentially answer the question of whether we are we alone. HWO will also serve as a powerful general astrophysics observatory, enabling breakthroughs in galaxy evolution, stellar astrophysics, and dark matter studies. Currently in pre-formulation, the project has established Exploratory Analytic Cases (EACs), a series of architectural concept designs used to assess the mission’s demanding science objectives while exploring challenging engineering parameters. This paper describes the first three EACs, starting with observing strategies and error budget formulation and then progressing to design formulations, trade studies and lessons learned; this paper also discusses the integrated modeling pipeline, a key multidisciplinary system-level analysis capability, and analysis findings as applied to the first EAC. These activities set the stage for the follow on EACs 4 and 5, which will further explore the trade space and prepare for the baseline design that will support the Mission Concept Review (MCR).</p>

<p>2026-02-11, <strong>The high speed analog optical readout system designed for low temperature experiments</strong>, Z. Zhou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10596v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.10596v1</a></p>

<p>For low-temperature experiments such as liquid xenon dark matter detectors, it is crucial to read out detector signals from cryostats. Traditionally, photoelectrical signals are transmitted from the cryogenic region to the outside using coaxial cables through vacuum feedthroughs on the cryostats. In this paper, we investigate an analog optical transmission method in which the raw electrical signals are converted into optical signals with light intensity linearly proportional to the electrical amplitude, transmitted out of the cryogenic environment through optical fiber, and subsequently converted back into electrical signals by photoelectric devices while preserving the signal waveform. This new approach offers advantages, including low attenuation over long-distance transmission and reduced crosstalk across the feedthroughs. Additionally, the low-temperature optical wavelength multiplexing scheme has been investigated and applied, increasing the transmission capability of a single fiber. At -100 degree Celsius, the proposed analog optical readout system achieves a -3dB bandwidth of larger than 150MHz, a dynamic range of up to 500mV, and a low cryogenic-region power consumption of 70mW per channel, demonstrating its strong potential for low-temperature experiments.</p>

<p>Astrophysical black holes are embedded in surrounding dark and baryonic matter that can measurably perturb the spacetime. We construct a self-consistent spacetime describing a slowly rotating black hole embedded in an external matter distribution, modeling the surrounding dark matter halo as an anisotropic fluid. Working within the slow-rotation approximation, we capture leading-order spin and frame-dragging effects while retaining analytic transparency. We show that the presence and rotation of the halo induce distinct deviations from the vacuum black hole geometry, modifying inertial frame dragging, equatorial circular geodesics, the light ring, the innermost stable circular orbit, and radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies. These effects produce systematic shifts in orbital constants of motion and the locations of epicyclic resonances. In particular, the epicyclic frequency ratios develop nonmonotonic behavior, such as local minima. We further demonstrate that these features depend on the angular velocity of the surrounding fluid, reflecting the interplay between environmental gravity and frame dragging. Our results demonstrate that environmental and rotational effects can leave observable imprints on precision strong-field probes, particularly extreme mass-ratio inspirals, where small corrections accumulate over many orbital cycles. This work provides a minimal and extensible framework for incorporating realistic astrophysical environments into strong-field tests of gravity with future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.</p>

<p>2026-02-11, <strong>Unidentified falling objects in the LHC as dark matter signals</strong>, Xunyu Liang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10562v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.10562v1</a></p>

<p>Unidentified Falling Objects (UFOs) refer to sporadic beam losses observed during LHC operation. The prevailing explanation is that micrometer-sized dust particles released from the beam screen produce beam losses through interactions with the protons. However, the release mechanism of these particles remains unknown. We propose that roughly $(1-10)$% of UFOs may be caused by axion quark nuggets (AQNs), macroscopic dark matter (DM) candidates with masses of order $(5-1000)\,$g. The AQN model naturally relates the dark- and visible-matter abundances ($Ω_\mathrm{DM}\simΩ_\mathrm{visible}$) and provides a mechanism for generating the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry, with DM composed of both matter and antimatter AQNs. When passing underground within approximately 100km of the LHC, an antimatter AQN generates acoustic waves strong enough to trigger multiple UFO events within $2\,$s. If three correlated UFOs (placed at different locations along the LHC ring) are detected, the signal-to-noise ratio can exceed 5 across the entire allowed AQN mass range for a measurement time of about 360 hours. Practically, the LHC can serve as a large broadband acoustic detector for AQNs.</p>

<p>2026-02-12, <strong>Population synthesis predictions of the Galactic compact binary gravitational wave foreground detectable by LISA</strong>, Jake McMillan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11765v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.11765v1</a></p>

<p>We use population synthesis modelling to predict the gravitational wave (GW) signal that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect from the Galactic population of compact binary systems. We implement a realistic star formation history with time and position-dependent metallicity, and account for the effect of supernova kicks on present-day positions. We consider all binaries that have a white dwarf (WD), neutron star (NS), or black hole primary in the present-day. We predict that the summed GW signal from all Galactic binaries will already be detectable 3 months into the LISA mission, by measuring the power spectrum of the total GW strain. We provide a simple publicly available code to calculate such a power spectrum from a user-defined binary population. In the full 4 year baseline mission lifetime, we conservatively predict that $&gt;2000$ binaries could be individually detectable as GW sources. We vary the assumed common envelope (CE) efficiency $α$, and find that it influences both the shape of the power spectrum and the relative number of detectable systems with WD and NS progenitors. In particular, the ratio of individually detectable binaries with chirp mass $\mathcal{M} &lt; M_\odot$ to those with $\mathcal{M} \geqslant M_\odot$ increases with $α$. We therefore conclude that LISA may be able to diagnose the CE efficiency, which is currently poorly constrained.</p>

<p>2026-02-11, <strong>The “bubbly” interstellar medium as origin for the inhomogeneous internal metallicity distributions in large disk galaxies</strong>, Benjamin Metha et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11450v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.11450v1</a></p>

<p>Resolved metallicity studies of local disk galaxies have revealed that their interstellar media (ISMs) are far from chemically homogeneous, displaying significant ($\sim 0.05$ dex) variations in the metallicity on characteristic scales of a few hundred parsecs. Such data is at odds with most analytical models, where the ISM is predicted to be more well-mixed. Here, we suggest that the observed small-scale features seen in galaxies may be superbubbles of metal-enriched gas created by a collection of core collapse supernovae with tight spatial (and temporal) correlation. In this scenario, the size of the metallicity fluctuations (superbubble radius, $φ$) is set by the disk scale height of the galaxy in question (after which point shock breakout favours preferential expansion along directions perpendicular to the dense disc), and the amount of additional metals contained within a fluctuation is proportional to the star formation efficiency in superbubble regions ($ε$). To test this theory, we analysed metallicity maps from the PHANGS-MUSE sample of galaxies using a geostatistical forward-modelling approach. We find $φ\simeq 300$ pc and $ε= 0.1-0.2$, in good agreement with our theoretical model. Further, these small-scale parameters are found to be related to the global galaxy properties, suggesting that the local structure of the interstellar medium of galaxies is not universal. Such a model of star formation paints a new picture of galaxy evolution in the modern universe: in large local galaxies, star formation appears steady and regular when averaged over large scales. However, on small scales, these large galaxies remain intrinsically bursty like their smaller, high-redshift counterparts.</p>

<p>2026-02-11, <strong>Filling The Pockets: The Spherical Nature of 3D Deflagration in Thermonuclear Supernovae</strong>, S. Shiber et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11341v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.11341v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate thermonuclear explosions within the delayed detonation framework. While spherical delayed detonation models generally reproduce key observational features, a fundamental inconsistency emerges in three dimensions: 3D hydrodynamic simulations exhibit insufficient white dwarf expansion during the deflagration phase. We identify the early deflagration stage, when the burning is dominated by the laminar speed, as a critical phase and explore potential solutions using three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations performed with the FLASH code. In hydrodynamical simulations, the early deflagration phase produces large pockets of unburned C/O, leading to inefficient burning. Much of the released energy is deposited into buoyantly rising plumes rather than into the global pre-expansion of the white dwarf, which is required to produce the partially burned layers characteristic of SNe Ia. In contrast, when preexisting turbulent velocity fields and strong magnetic fields, on scales expected from the smoldering phase, are included, the effective burning approaches that in spherical models. Both turbulence and magnetic fields promote the entrainment of burned material into unburned pockets, addressing a long-standing problem in multi-dimensional deflagration models. The resulting streaks of burned material enable the conductive ignition of the surrounding unburned fuel. The dominant effect is not a change in the small-scale flame physics (~10^{-3} cm), but rather enhanced mixing between burned and unburned material. As expected, this mechanism is most efficient when the turbulent length scales are smaller than those of the unburned plumes.</p>

<p>In the context of a spatially flat $Λ(t)$CDM cosmology, we investigate interacting dark energy (IDE) scenarios characterized by phenomenological interaction terms proportional to the Hubble expansion rate and the dark energy density. Our analysis is performed at both the background and linear perturbation levels, with particular emphasis on the evolution of dark matter density fluctuations. Cosmological constraints are derived from a joint analysis of CMB distance priors, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from Pantheon+, Redshift-Space Distortions (RSD), and $H(z)$ data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC). Using the linear growth of matter perturbations, we estimate the clustering parameter $S_8$ within IDE extensions of the flat $Λ(t)$CDM framework. At the perturbative level, we consider interaction terms of the form $Q_{\text{I}}=\varepsilon a H\barρ_{Λ(t)}$ (Model I) and $Q_{\text{II}}=\varepsilon H\barρ_{Λ(t)}$ (Model II). From the combined dataset, we obtain the constraints $S_8 = 0.870 \pm 0.026$ for Model I and $S_8 = 0.872 \pm 0.026$ for Model II. Finally, we discuss the implications for the coupling parameter $\varepsilon$, taking into account the semi-analytical approximations and observational data employed in this study.</p>

<p>2026-02-11, <strong>Measurement prospects for the pair-instability mass cutoff with gravitational waves</strong>, Matthew Mould et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11282v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.11282v1</a></p>

<p>Pair-instability supernovae leave behind no compact remnants, resulting in a predicted gap in the distribution of stellar black-hole masses. Gravitational waves from binary black-hole mergers probe the relevant mass range and analyses of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog (GWTC-4) indicate a possible mass cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$. However, the robustness of this result is yet to be tested. To this end, we simulate a comprehensive suite of gravitational-wave catalogs with full Bayesian parameter estimation and analyze them with parametric population models. For catalogs similar to GWTC-4, confident identification of a cutoff is not guaranteed, but GWTC-4 results are compatible with the best constraints among our simulations. Conversely, spurious false identification of a cutoff is unlikely. For catalogs expected by the end of the O4 observing run, uncertainty in the cutoff mass is reduced by $\gtrsim20\%$, but a cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$ yields only a lower bound on the $^{12}\mathrm{C}(α,γ)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, which in terms of the S-factor at $300\,\mathrm{keV}$ may be $S_{300}\gtrsim125\,\mathrm{keV}\,\mathrm{b}$ at $90\%$ credibility by the end of O4. Relative uncertainties on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ from gravitational-wave data alone can still be up to $100\%$. We also analyze GWTC-4 with the nonparametric PixelPop population model, finding that some mass features are more prominent than in parametric models but a sharp cutoff is not required. However, the parametric model passes a likelihood-based predictive test in GWTC-4 and the PixelPop results are consistent with those from our simulated catalogs where a cutoff is present. We use the simple focus of this study to emphasize that such tests are necessary to make astrophysical claims from gravitational-wave catalogs going forward.</p>

<p>2026-02-11, <strong>DeepRed: an architecture for redshift estimation</strong>, Alessandro Meroni et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11281v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.11281v1</a></p>

<p>Estimating redshift is a central task in astrophysics, but its measurement is costly and time-consuming. In addition, current image-based methods are often validated on homogeneous datasets. The development and comparison of networks able generalize across different morphologies, ranging from galaxies to gravitationally-lensed transients, and observational conditions, remain an open challenge. This work proposes DeepRed, a deep learning pipeline that demonstrates how modern computer vision architectures, including ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, and MLP-Mixer, can estimate redshifts from images of galaxies, gravitational lenses, and gravitationally-lensed supernovae. We compare these architectures and their ensemble to both neural networks (A1, A3, NetZ, and PhotoZ) and a feature-based method (HOG+SVR) on simulated (DeepGraviLens) and real (KiDS, SDSS) datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. On DeepGraviLens, DeepRed achieves a significant improvement in the Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation compared to the best baseline (PhotoZ): 55% on DES-deep (using EfficientNet), 51% on DES-wide (Ensemble), 52% on DESI-DOT (Ensemble), and 46% on LSST-wide (Ensemble). On real observations from the KiDS survey, the pipeline outperforms the best baseline (NetZ), improving NMAD by 16% on a general test set without high-probability lenses (Ensemble) and 27% on high-probability lenses (Ensemble). For non-lensed galaxies in the SDSS dataset, the MLP-Mixer architecture achieves a 5% improvement over the best baselines (A3 and NetZ). SHAP shows that the models correctly focus on the objects of interest with over 95% localization accuracy on high-quality images, validating the reliability of the predictions. These findings suggest that deep learning is a scalable, robust, and interpretable solution for redshift estimation in large-scale surveys.</p>

<p>2026-02-11, <strong>BlastBerries: How Supernovae Affect Lyman Continuum Escape Fractions and Ionizing Photon Production in Local Analogs of High-Redshift Galaxies</strong>, Miranda Y. Kong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11261v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.11261v1</a></p>

<p>While compact, star-forming galaxies are believed to play a key role in cosmic reionization, the physical mechanisms enabling the escape of ionizing photons through the galactic interstellar medium remain unclear. Supernova (SN) feedback is one possible mechanism for clearing neutral gas channels to allow the escape of Lyman continuum photons. Here, we use SN discoveries in low-redshift analogs of high-redshift star-forming galaxies – Green Pea galaxies and their even lower-redshift counterparts, Blueberry (BB) galaxies – to understand how SNe shape the properties of their host galaxies at high redshifts. We cross-match 1242 BB galaxies with transient discovery reports and identify 11 SNe, ten of which are likely core-collapse SNe, and compare their hosts to the larger BB population. We find that SN-hosting BBs exhibit elevated star formation rates, burstier star formation histories within the last $\sim$50 Myr, and higher stellar masses. We estimate the occurrence rates of SNe in BB galaxies, finding that the SN rate may be slightly suppressed in BBs compared to field galaxies of similar mass, but we are unable to fully control for observational uncertainties. Finally, SN hosts show bluer UV slopes than non-host BB galaxies at 2.1$σ$ significance and lower ionizing photon production efficiency at 7.9$σ$ significance; the former result offers modest support for the hypothesis that SN-driven feedback plays a role in facilitating the escape of ionizing photons, while the latter may imply that SN-driven quenching decreases the rate of ionizing photon production in compact star-forming galaxies during the epoch of reionization.</p>

<p>2026-02-11, <strong>3D insights into SN 1987A: ALMA observations compared to hydrodynamical explosion simulations</strong>, R. Wesson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11259v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.11259v1</a></p>

<p>We obtain three-dimensional distributions of CO and SiO molecules from high spatial resolution (0.03–0.06”) ALMA observations of SN 1987A at two different epochs. The evolution between these two epochs is consistent with homologous expansion. From these 3D maps, we reconstruct the 3D mass distributions of the ejecta in CO and SiO molecules, which we compare with those obtained by state-of-the-art, long-time hydrodynamical supernova explosion models computed with the Prometheus-HotB code for 10 different progenitors, including both red and blue supergiants. The models which best match the mass distributions correspond to explosions of binary-merger blue supergiant progenitors; at least two such models approximately reproduce the observed CO morphology. In contrast, the SiO velocity distribution and morphology are not as well reproduced in these models, indicating insufficient mixing of Si into the outer layers already at the progenitor stage. The theoretical models suggest a strong correlation between the centre of mass of the densest carbon- and oxygen-rich ejecta and the direction of the neutron-star kick. If such a correlation also applies to the CO emission in the ejecta of SN 1987A, the kick of the compact remnant is expected to point towards the observer, at an angle of approximately $45^\circ$ to the north.</p>

<p>2026-02-11, <strong>Unmasking LHAASO J2108+5157: Near Infrared Insights into a Mysterious TeV Source</strong>, Josep Martí et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11148v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.11148v1</a></p>

<p>LHAASO J2108+5157 is one of the few ultra-high energy gamma-ray sources in the LHAASO catalogue without secure counterpart at longer wavelengths. Several Galactic scenarios have been proposed, including an evolved supernova remnant and a pulsar wind nebula. Yet, no shocked gas, shell-like structure, or compact pulsar candidate has been identified. Follow-up observations with VERITAS and the LST-1 prototype have not firmly clarified its nature. A recent microquasar candidate from GMRT radio data remains uncertain. Here we present the first dedicated near-infrared study of the field, combining deep JHKs imaging with narrow band observations targeting the H2 v=1-0 S(1) line. Our observations were initially planned to encompass the full source region, but now only partially cover the latest updated position and size of LHAASO J2108+5157. We find no evidence of shocked emission, extended nebular structures, or an accreting compact object signature in the covered field. The GMRT radio source, despite its jet-like morphology, exhibits near-infrared properties incompatible with both a Galactic microquasar and a nearby radio galaxy, discouraging an association with the gamma-ray emission. Our analysis reveals no convincing counterpart consistent within the positional uncertainty, leaving LHAASO J2108+5157 as an enigmatic ultra-high energy emitter that requires deeper observations.</p>

<p>2026-02-11, <strong>New constraints on cosmic anisotropy from galaxy clusters using an improved dipole fitting method</strong>, Jianping Hu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11093v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.11093v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we attempted to apply the dipole fitting (DF) method to galaxy clusters to search for cosmic anisotropic signals, and to construct a statistical isotropic analysis scheme for them. Compared to Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia), the galaxy clusters offer a significant advantage in terms of spatial distribution. This advantage makes the anisotropic signals obtained from them more reliable. From 313 galaxy clusters (Chandra + XMM-Newton), we find two preferred directions (l, b) = (${257.82^{\circ}}_{-52.88}^{+58.01}$, $-31.30{^{\circ}}_{-39.46}^{+35.92}$) and ($80.89{^{\circ}}_{-52.46}^{+60.97}$, $31.75{^{\circ}}_{-40.16}^{+35.19}$). The former to a direction where the universe is expanding at a faster rate than the surrounding area, while the latter to a slower rate of expansion. The corresponding magnitude of anisotropy is $|A|$ = 5.2 $\sim$ 5.4 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$. The results of statistical isotropy analyses give $\sim$1.0$σ$ confidence level. From the reanalyses based on the subsamples including Chandra, XMM-Newton, low reshift (LR, $z &lt; 0.10$), high redshift (HR, $z &gt; 0.10$) datasets, we find that the observation equipment and sample redshift can affect the preferred direction, anisotropic magnitude, and statistical significance of anisotropy. The XMM-Newton dataset gives a statistical significance of 2.26$σ$ (Mock) and 2.86$σ$ (Iso) which are much higher than that from Chandra and the total datasets. The magnitude of anisotropy $|A|$ from HR dataset is larger than that from LR dataset. Overall, our results indicate the presence of anisotropic signals in galaxy clusters, which must be taken seriously. Further test is still needed to better understand these signals.</p>

<p>2026-02-11, <strong>The metal-poor tail of the APOGEE survey II. Spectral analysis of Mg and Si in very metal-poor APOGEE spectra</strong>, M. Montelius et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10883v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.10883v1</a></p>

<p>H-band spectra contain very limited spectral information for stars at the most metal-poor tail ( Fe/H &lt; -2.5) because the available Fe lines in FGK stars in this wavelength range are weak. The first paper in this series successfully identified a sample of 327 very metal-poor stars (with [Fe/H] &lt; -2) from the APOGEE database, 289 of which are on the red giant branch. The spectra of these stars were not properly analysed by the APOGEE main pipeline because they are very metal poor. In this work, we measure metallicities for these stars using the abundances of the elements Mg and Si. We demonstrate that the absorption lines of the elements Mg and Si are of good quality despite the challenging combination of (low) metallicity, wavelength regime, spectral resolution, and signal-to-noise ratios available for these spectra. A specialised pipeline was designed to measure the abundance of Mg and Si in APOGEE spectra and yielded a robust estimate of the overall metallicity. In order to provide reliable measurements, we tested three different sets of assumptions for Mg and Si enhancement. We present Mg and Si abundances as well as overall metallicities for 327 stars, all of which had previously gotten null values from the main APOGEE pipeline for either the calibrated M/H or [Fe/H] . The typical uncertainties for our measurements are 0.2 dex. We found five stars in our sample with unusual [Si/Mg] abundances higher than 0.5, and we connect this signature to globular cluster stars, and this might be related to specific supernova events. Our data suggest a concentration of high [Si/Mg] stars in the Sextans dwarf galaxy. Other dwarf galaxies are found to agree well with results in the literature. Our derived metallicities range between -3.1 $\leq$ [M/H] $\leq$ -2.25, thereby pushing the metal-poor tail of APOGEE results down by 0.6 dex.</p>

<p>2026-02-11, <strong>A 682-second X-ray Periodicity in CH Cygni: Evidence for a Magnetic White Dwarf</strong>, Manuel Pichardo Marcano et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10511v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.10511v1</a></p>

<p>Symbiotic stars are interacting binaries consisting of a red giant and typically a white dwarf, important as potential Type Ia supernova progenitors. Despite theoretical predictions that white dwarfs in symbiotic systems should often be magnetic, direct evidence has been elusive. We report the discovery of a $682.5 \pm 7$ s periodicity in the XMM-Newton X-ray light curve that we interpret as the spin period of the WD in CH Cygni. This detection provides strong evidence for a magnetic white dwarf in CH Cygni, making it only the second WD symbiotic star with confirmed X-ray pulsations after R Aquarii. Our discovery supports the magnetic propeller model previously proposed for CH Cygni’s jet activity and state transitions.</p>
