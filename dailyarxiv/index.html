<p>2024-11-12, <strong>Complete Two-loop Renormalization Group Equation of the Weinberg Operator</strong>, Alejandro Ibarra et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08011v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.08011v1</a></p>

<p>We calculate the renormalization group equation (RGE) of the lepton-number-violating Weinberg operator with the particle content of the Standard Model (SM), thus completing the set of two-loop RGEs of the SM effective field theory up to dimension 5. We identify new diagrams that could increase the rank of the Wilson coefficient of the Weinberg operator, and we calculate the complete two-loop RGE for the neutrino mass eigenvalues and leptonic mixing matrix. We also briefly discuss some phenomenological implications of the RGEs.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>New Physics effects with right-handed neutrinos in semileptonic decay $B_c^+ \to B_s μ^+ ν_μ$</strong>, Priyanka Boora et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07987v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07987v1</a></p>

<p>We extend the Standard Model with the general effective Hamiltonian for the quark level transition $c \to s \ell \nu$ with a complete set of four fermion operators including right-handed neutrinos. The current experimental measurements in charm decays are compatible with the Standard Model predictions and are used to constrain the new physics. With the available experimental data, we fit a $\chi^2$ function to get the best-fit values of the NP WCs. We investigate the impact of allowed new physics in the observables such as differential branching fraction, forward-backward asymmetry, lepton polarization asymmetry, and convexity parameter in the semileptonic decay $B_c^+ \to B_s \mu^+ \nu_{\mu}$. The different types of new physics scenarios have significant effects on these considered observables. The future experimental information of these observables can help to disentangle the structure of new physics.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>Revisiting X-ray Afterglows of Jetted Tidal Disruption Events with the External Reverse Shock</strong>, Chengchao Yuan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07925v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07925v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the external reverse shock region of relativistic jets as the origin of X-ray afterglows of jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs) that exhibit luminous jets accompanied by fast-declining non-thermal X-ray emissions. We model the dynamics of jet propagating within an external density medium, accounting for continuous energy injection driven by accretion activities. We compute the time-dependent synchrotron and inverse Compton emissions from the reverse shock region. Our analysis demonstrates that the reverse shock scenario can potentially explain the X-ray light curves and spectra of four jetted TDEs, AT 2022cmc, Swift J1644, Swift J2058, and Swift J1112. Notably, the rapid steepening of the late-stage X-ray light curves can be attributed jointly to the jet break and cessation of the central engine as the accretion rate drops below the Eddington limit. Using parameters obtained from X-ray data fitting, we also discuss the prospects for $\gamma$-ray and neutrino detection.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>A nearby FR I type radio galaxy 3C 120 as a neutrino emitting candidate</strong>, Rong-Qing Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07827v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07827v1</a></p>

<p>Although connections between flaring blazars and some IceCube neutrinos have been established, the dominant sources for the bulk extragalactic neutrino emissions are still unclear and one widely suggested candidate is a population of radio galaxies. Because of their relatively low $\gamma$-ray radiation luminosities ($L_\gamma$), it is rather challenging to confirm such a hypothesis with the neutrino/GeV flare association. Here we report on the search for GeV $\gamma$-ray counterpart of the neutrino IC-180213A and show that the nearby ($z$ = 0.03) broad line radio galaxy 3C 120 is the unique co-spatial GeV $\gamma$-ray source in a half-year epoch around the neutrino detection. Particularly, an intense $\gamma$-ray flare, the second strongest one among the entire 16-year period, is temporally coincident with the detection of IC-180213A. Accompanying optical flare is observed, too. We also find that the IC-180213A/3C 120 association well follows the $L_\gamma$-$D_{L}^{2}$ correlation for the (candidate) neutrino sources including NGC 1068 and some blazars. These facts are strongly in favor of 3C 120 as a high energy neutrino emitter and provide the first piece of evidence for the radio galaxy origin of some PeV neutrinos.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>Non-thermal Dark Matter in $U(1)_{B-L}$ Extension of Inert Doublet Model</strong>, A. Elsheshtawy et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07787v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07787v1</a></p>

<p>We propose an extension of the Inert Doublet Model (IDM) that explains both neutrino masses and dark matter (DM) in the intermediate-mass range by incorporating a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry. This additional symmetry enables the inclusion of right-handed neutrinos, providing a natural mechanism for neutrino mass generation. While the CP-even component of the inert doublet can serve as a DM candidate, its thermal relic abundance is insufficient to match the observed DM density. To address this, we introduce a non-thermal production mechanism, where a heavy scalar associated with the $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry decays into the inert doublet scalar, yielding a viable relic abundance at low reheating temperatures. We also examine both direct and indirect detection prospects for this DM candidate and assess the model against current experimental constraints.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>Detecting ultralight axions from multifrequency observations of neutral hydrogen intensity mapping</strong>, Qianshuo Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07735v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07735v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the effects of ultralight axions (ULAs) on the differential brightness temperature fluctuations of neutral hydrogen at the post-reionization stage. Unique structure suppression features under the influence of ULAs are studied from angular correlations of the neutral hydrogen signals observed at different frequencies. Moreover, ULAs can behave like dark energy or dark matter at different mass regimes, implying that the fraction of the ULA energy density would be correlated with the sum of neutrino masses and the parameters of the dark energy equation of state for dark matter and dark energy like ULAs, respectively. We have explored the parameter space for the ULA physics and possible degeneracies among dark energy, neutrinos, and ULAs using the theoretical angular correlation functions expected from future intensity mapping surveys.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>Sensitivity Study of Supernova Neutrinos for Mass Hierarchy</strong>, Riya Gaba et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07716v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07716v1</a></p>

<p>Supernovae represent some of the most energetically explosive events in the universe, with a substantial fraction of their released gravitational energy carried away by neutrinos. This study evaluates the sensitivity of three next-generation neutrino detectors which are Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K), and the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to supernova neutrinos, specifically focusing on their ability to discern between normal and inverted mass hierarchies. We utilize three different flux models: Bollig, Tamborra and Nakazato, employing the SNEWPY software to simulate the expected neutrino fluxes from core-collapse supernovae. These models highlight the variability in the predictions due to different progenitors and simulation methods. By analyzing the event rates across various interaction channels and implementing the adiabatic Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect on the neutrino flux, we have calculated the expected detection rates for each detector. Our results indicate that sensitivities range from ${\sim}3\sigma$ to ${\sim}9\sigma$ for DUNE, ${\sim}4\sigma$ to ${\sim}16\sigma$ for Hyper-K and ${\sim}1.7\sigma$ to ${\sim}6.7\sigma$ for JUNO depending on distance and flux model, with sensitivity diminishing significantly at larger distances. This work underscores the potential of future neutrino observatories to enhance our understanding of fundamental physics through the study of supernova neutrinos.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>Investigation and optimization of the deconvolution method for PMT waveform reconstruction</strong>, Jingzhe Tang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07620v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07620v1</a></p>

<p>Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are extensively employed as photosensors in neutrino and dark matter detection. The precise charge and timing information extracted from the PMT waveform plays a crucial role in energy and vertex reconstruction. In this study, we investigate the deconvolution algorithm utilized for PMT waveform reconstruction, while enhancing the timing separation ability for pile-up hits by redesigning filters based on the time-frequency uncertainty principle. This filter design sacrifices signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to achieve narrower pulse widths. Furthermore, we optimize the selection of signal pulses in the case of low SNR based on Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Monte Carlo data confirms that our optimization yields enhanced reconstruction performance: improving timing separation ability for pile-up hits from $\sim$10 ns to $3\sim5$ ns, while controlling residual nonlinearity of charge reconstruction within 1\%.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>Physics of radio antennas</strong>, Mohammad Ful Hossain Seikh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07507v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07507v1</a></p>

<p>Radio antennas are widely used in the field of particle astrophysics in searches for ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) and neutrinos (UHEN). It is therefore necessary to properly describe the physics of their response. In this article, we summarize the mathematics underlying parameterizations of radio antennas. As a paradigm, we focus on a half-wave dipole and also discuss measurements of characteristics, performed in an electromagnetic (EM) anechoic chamber.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>The Multi-Scale Multi-Phase Circumgalactic Medium: Observed and Simulated</strong>, Celine Peroux et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07988v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07988v1</a></p>

<p>These are exciting times for studies of galaxy formation and the growth of structures. New observatories and advanced simulations are revolutionising our understanding of the cycling of matter into, through, and out of galaxies. This chapter first describes why baryons are essential for galaxy evolution, providing a key test of Lambda-Cold Dark Matter cosmological model. In particular, we describe a basic framework to convert measurements of the gas properties observed in absorption spectra into global estimates of the condensed (stars and cold gas) matter mass densities. We then review our current understanding of the cycling of baryons from global to galactic scales, in the so-called circumgalactic medium. The final sections are dedicated to future prospects, identifying new techniques and up-coming facilities as well as key open questions. This chapter is complemented with a series of hands-on exercises which provide a practical guide to using publicly available hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Beyond providing a direct connection between new observations and advanced simulations, these exercises give the reader the necessary tools to make use of these theoretical models to address their own science questions. Ultimately, our increasingly accurate description of the circumgalactic medium reveals its crucial role in transforming the pristine early Universe into the rich and diverse Universe of the present day.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>From Dark Matter Minihalos to Large-Scale Radiative Feedback: A Self-Consistent 3D Simulation of the First Stars and Galaxies using Neural Networks</strong>, Colton Feathers et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07875v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07875v1</a></p>

<p>A key obstacle to accurate models of the first stars and galaxies is the vast range of distance scales that must be considered. While star formation occurs on sub-parsec scales within dark matter (DM) minihalos, it is influenced by large-scale baryon-dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{\rm bc}$) and Lyman-Werner (LW) radiative feedback which vary significantly on scales of $\sim$100 Mpc. We present a novel approach to this issue in which we utilize artificial neural networks (NNs) to emulate the Population III (PopIII) and Population II (PopII) star formation histories of many small-scale cells given by a more complex semi-analytic framework based on DM halo merger trees. Within each simulation cell, the NN takes a set of input parameters that depend on the surrounding large-scale environment, such as the cosmic overdensity, $\delta(\vec{x})$, and $v_{\rm bc}$ of the cell, then outputs the resulting star formation far more efficiently than is possible with the semi-analytic model. This rapid emulation allows us to self-consistently determine the LW background intensity on $\sim$100 Mpc scales, while simultaneously including the detailed merger histories (and corresponding star formation histories) of the low-mass minihalos that host the first stars. Comparing with the full semi-analytic framework utilizing DM halo merger trees, our NN emulators yield star formation histories with redshift-averaged errors of $\sim$10.2\% and $\sim$9.2\% for PopII and PopIII, respectively. When compared to a simpler sub-grid star formation prescription reliant on halo mass function integration, we find that the diversity of halo merger histories in our simulation leads to enhanced spatial fluctuations, an earlier transition from PopIII to PopII dominated star formation, and more scatter in star formation histories overall.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>Wormhole-Induced ALP Dark Matter</strong>, Dhong Yeon Cheong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07713v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07713v1</a></p>

<p>Non-perturbative gravitational effects induce explicit global symmetry breaking terms within axion models. These exponentially suppressed terms in the potential give a mass contribution to the axion-like particles (ALPs). In this work we investigate this scenario with a scalar field charged under a global $U(1)$ symmetry and having a non-minimal coupling to gravity. Given the exponential dependence, the ALP can retain a mass spanning a wide range, which can act as a dark matter component. We specify pre-inflationary and post-inflationary production mechanisms of these ALPs, with the former from the misalignment mechanism and the latter from both the misalignment and cosmic-string decay. We identify the allowed parameter ranges that explain the dark matter abundance for both a general inflation case and a case where the radial mode scalar drives inflation, each in metric and Palatini formalisms. We show that the ALP can be the dominant component of the dark matter in a wide range of its mass, $m_{a} \in [10^{-21}~\mathrm{eV},\, \mathrm{TeV}]$, depending on the inflationary scenario and the $U(1)$ breaking scale. These results indicate that ALPs can be responsible for our dark matter abundance within a setup purely from non-perturbative gravitational effects.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>Primordial black holes and induced gravitational waves from logarithmic non-Gaussianity</strong>, Ryoto Inui et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07647v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07647v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the formation of primordial black hole (PBH) based on numerical relativity simulations and peak theory as well as the corresponding scalar induced gravitational wave (SIGW) signals in the presence of \emph{logarithmic non-Gaussianities} which has recently been confirmed in a wide class of inflation models. Through numerical calculations, we find certain parameter spaces of the critical thresholds for the type A PBH formation and reveal a maximum critical threshold value. We also find that there is a region where no PBH is produced from type II fluctuations contrary to a previous study. We then confirm that SIGW signals originated from the logarithmic non-Gaussianity are detectable in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna if PBHs account for whole dark matter. Finally, we discuss the SIGW interpretation of the nHz stochastic gravitational wave background reported by the recent pulsar timing array observations. We find that PBH overproduction is a serious problem for most of the parameter space, while this tension might still be alleviated in the non-perturbative regime.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>Measures of luminous and dark matter in galaxies across time</strong>, Jonathan Freundlich et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07605v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07605v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter is one of the pillars of the current standard model of structure formation: it is assumed to constitute most of the matter in the Universe. However, it can so far only be probed indirectly through its gravitational effects, and its nature remains elusive. In this focus meeting, we discussed different methods used to estimate galaxies’ visible and dark matter masses in the nearby and distant Universe. We reviewed successes of the standard model relying on cold dark matter, confronted observations with simulations, and highlighted inconsistencies between the two. We discussed how robust mass measurements can help plan, perform, and refine particle dark matter searches. We further exchanged about alternatives to cold dark matter, such as warm, self-interacting, and fuzzy dark matter, as well as modified gravity. Finally, we discussed prospects and strategies that could be implemented to reveal the nature of this crucial component of the Universe.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>Constraining Dark Matter Models with a Light Mediator from CDEX-10 Experiment at China Jinping Underground Laboratory</strong>, Qi-Yuan Nie et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07543v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07543v1</a></p>

<p>We search for nuclear recoil signals of dark matter models with a light mediator using data taken from a p-type point-contact germanium detector of the CDEX-10 experiment at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory. The 90% confidence level upper limits on the DM-nucleon interaction cross section from 205.4 kg-day exposure data are derived, excluding new parameter space in 2~5 GeV DM mass when the mediator mass is comparable to or lighter than the typical momentum transfer. We further interpret our results to constrain a specific self-interacting dark matter model with a light mediator coupling to the photon through kinetic mixing, and set experimental limits on the model parameter region favored by astrophysical observations.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>The Dependence of Dark Matter Halo Properties on the Morphology of Their Central Galaxies from Weak Lensing</strong>, Zhenjie Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07525v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07525v1</a></p>

<p>Xu \&amp; Jing (2022) reported a monotonic relationship between host halo mass ((M_h)) and the morphology of massive central galaxies, characterized by the S'ersic index ((n)), at fixed stellar mass, suggesting that morphology could serve as a good secondary proxy for halo mass. Since their results were derived using the indirect abundance matching method, we further investigate the connection between halo properties and central galaxy morphology using weak gravitational lensing. We apply galaxy-galaxy lensing to measure the excess surface density around CMASS central galaxies with stellar masses in the range of (11.3 &lt; \log M_*/{\rm M_\odot} &lt; 11.7), using the HSC shear catalog processed through the Fourier\_Quad pipeline. By dividing the sample based on (n), we confirm a positive correlation between (n) and (M_h), and observe a possible evidence of the positive correlation of (n) and halo concentration. After accounting for color, we find that neither color nor morphology alone can determine halo mass, suggesting that a combination of both may serve as a better secondary proxy. In comparison to hydrodynamic simulations, we find that TNG300 produce much weaker correlations between (M_h) and (n). Furthermore, disabling jet-mode active galactic nuclei feedback in SIMBA simulations results in the disappearance of the positive (n-M_h) relationship, suggesting that the star formation history influenced by black holes may be a contributing factor.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>A halo model approach for mock catalogs of time-variable strong gravitational lenses</strong>, Katsuya T. Abe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07509v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07509v1</a></p>

<p>Time delays in both galaxy- and cluster-scale strong gravitational lenses have recently attracted a lot of attention in the context of the Hubble tension. Future wide-field cadenced surveys, such as the LSST, are anticipated to discover strong lenses across various scales. We generate mock catalogs of strongly lensed QSOs and SNe on galaxy-, group-, and cluster-scales based on a halo model that incorporates dark matter halos, galaxies, and subhalos. For the upcoming LSST survey, we predict that approximately 3500 lensed QSOs and 200 lensed SNe with resolved multiple images will be discovered. Among these, about 80 lensed QSOs and 10 lensed SNe will have maximum image separations larger than 10 arcsec, which roughly correspond to cluster-scale strong lensing. We find that adopting the Chabrier stellar IMF instead of the fiducial Salpeter IMF reduces the predicted number of strong lenses approximately by half, while the distributions of lens and source redshifts and image separations are not significantly changed. In addition to mock catalogs of multiple-image lens systems, we create mock catalogs of highly magnified systems, including both multiple-image and single-image systems. We find that such highly magnified systems are typically produced by massive galaxies, but non-negligible fraction of them are located in the outskirt of galaxy groups and clusters. Furthermore, we compare subsamples of our mock catalogs with lensed QSO samples constructed from the SDSS and Gaia to find that our mock catalogs with the fiducial Salpeter IMF reproduce the observation quite well. In contrast, our mock catalogs with the Chabrier IMF predict a significantly smaller number of lensed QSOs compared with observations, which adds evidence that the stellar IMF of massive galaxies is Salpeter-like. Our python code SL-Hammocks as well as the mock catalogs are made available online. (abridged)</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>Et tu, Brute?: The Crab Nebula also exploded by jittering jets</strong>, Dmitry Shishkin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07938v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07938v1</a></p>

<p>We identify a point-symmetrical morphology comprised of seven pairs of opposite bays in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant Crab Nebula, which is consistent with the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe. We use a recently published infrared image of the Crab Nebula and apply image analysis to fit seven pairs of bays in the Crab, each pair of two bays and a symmetry axis connecting them. The seven symmetry axes intersect close to the explosion site, forming a point-symmetrical structure. We explain the bays as clumps that move slower than the low-density ejecta that the pulsar accelerated. Jittering jets that exploded the Crab formed the clumps during the explosion process. This shows that jittering jets explode even very low-energy CCSNe, as the Crab is, adding to the solidification of the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>Are there Black Hole Symbiotic X-ray Binaries?</strong>, Zhu-Ling Deng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07548v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07548v1</a></p>

<p>While there are over a dozen known neutron star (NS) symbiotic X-ray binaries (SyXBs) in the Galaxy, none SyXBs containing a black hole (BH) have been detected. We address this problem by incorporating binary population synthesis and the accretion properties of BHs fed by the wind from red giant companions. We investigate the impact of different supernova mechanisms, kick velocity distributions and wind velocities on the formation of both NS and BH SyXBs. Our simulations show that the number of BH SyXBs is at most one-sixth that of NS SyXBs in the Galaxy provided that the common envelope efficiency parameter $\alpha\sim 0.3-5$. And less than $\sim 10$ of BH SyXBs could be detectable in X-ray, considering their low radiation efficiencies. These findings indicate a scarcity of BH SyXBs in the Galaxy.</p>

<p>2024-11-12, <strong>Radio Follow-up Observations of SN 2023ixf by Japanese and Korean VLBIs</strong>, Yuhei Iwata et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07542v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07542v1</a></p>

<p>We report on radio follow-up observations of the nearby Type II supernova, SN 2023ixf, spanning from 1.7 to 269.9 days after the explosion, conducted using three very long baseline interferometers (VLBIs), which are the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN), the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA), and the Korean VLBI Network (KVN). In three observation epochs (152.3, 206.1, and 269.9 days), we detected emission at the 6.9 and 8.4 GHz bands, with a flux density of $\sim 5$ mJy. The flux density reached a peak at around 206.1 days, which is longer than the timescale to reach the peak observed in typical Type II supernovae. Based on the analytical model of radio emission, our late-time detections were inferred to be due to the decreasing optical depth. In this case, the mass-loss rate of the progenitor is estimated to have increased from $\sim 10^{-6} - 10^{-5}\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ to $\sim 10^{-4}\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ between 28 and 6 years before the explosion. Our radio constraints are also consistent with the mass-loss rate to produce a confined circumstellar medium proposed by previous studies, which suggest that the mass-loss rate increased from $\sim 10^{-4}\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ to $\gtrsim 10^{-2}\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ in the last few years before the explosion.</p>
