<p>2023-06-05, <strong>P, CP solution of the strong CP puzzle</strong>, Ravi Kuchimanchi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03039v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.03039v1</a></p>

<p>We use parity (P) to set $\theta_{QCD}$ to zero in the minimal left-right symmetric model, add a heavy vectorlike quark family, and obtain in a novel manner the Nelson Barr (NB) form associated so far only with spontaneous CP solution to the strong CP Puzzle. Our solution does not have the `coincidence of scales problem’, that typically plagues NB models. P protects $\bar{\theta}$, if it breaks at a scale $v_R$ below the mass $M$ of the heavy quarks, and $\bar{\theta} \sim 10^{-9} (v_R/M)^2$ is radiatively generated, which can be acceptably small. On the other hand, if $M &lt; v_R$, the $\bar{\theta} \sim 10^{-9}$ generated by the NB mechanism is too large, but $\delta_{CKM}$ can be obtained without the NB mechanism, and surprisingly a lower irreducible $\bar{\theta} \sim (10^{-13}~to~10^{-10}) ln( {v_R/M)}$, testable by neutron EDM experiments is generated. No leptonic CP violation is generated (Dirac phase $\delta_{CP} = 0~or~\pi$ in PMNS matrix) which makes the minimal model testable by neutrino experiments. We also discuss some challenges in a non-minimal model that generates leptonic CP violation. Lastly but importantly, we find with $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ gauge group, that there is an \textit{automatic} NB solution on imposing CP (global symmetry usually imposed to get the NB form is accidental once we have $SU(2)_R$), which does not require mirror or generalized parity and is more economical, as it works also with just 1 mirror generation.</p>

<p>2023-06-05, <strong>$f(Q)$-gravity and neutrino physics</strong>, Luís Atayde et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03015v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.03015v1</a></p>

<p>Within the $f(Q)$-gravity framework we perform a phenomenological study of the cosmological observables in light of the degeneracy between neutrinos physics and the modified gravity parameter and we identify specific patterns which allow to break such degeneracy. We also provide separately constraints on the total mass of the neutrinos, $\Sigma m_{\nu}$, and on the effective number of neutrino species, $N_{\rm eff}$, using cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), redshift space distortion (RSD), supernovae (SNIa), galaxy clustering (GC) and weak gravitational lensing (WL) measurements. The strongest upper bound on the total mass of the neutrinos is found for the combination of CMB+BAO+RSD+SNIa and it is $\Sigma m_\nu&lt;0.277$ eV at 95\% C.L. For the same combination of data we find $N_{\rm eff}=2.93^{+0.31}_{-0.34}$ at 95\% C.L. We also find that all combinations of data we consider, prefer a stronger gravitational interaction than $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we consider the $\chi^2$ and deviance information criterion statistics and find the $f(Q)+\Sigma m_\nu$ model to be statistically supported by data over the standard scenario. On the contrary $f(Q)+N_{\rm eff}$ is supported by CMB+BAO+RSD+SNIa but a moderate evidence against it is found with GC and WL data.</p>

<p>2023-06-05, <strong>Measurements of $π^+$, $π^-$, $p$, $\bar{p}$, $K^+$ and $K^-$ production in 120 GeV/$c$ p + C interactions</strong>, H. Adhikary et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02961v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.02961v1</a></p>

<p>This paper presents multiplicity measurements of charged hadrons produced in 120 GeV/$c$ proton-carbon interactions. The measurements were made using data collected at the NA61/SHINE experiment during two different data-taking periods, with increased phase space coverage in the second configuration due to the addition of new subdetectors. Particle identification via $dE/dx$ was employed to obtain double-differential production multiplicities of $\pi^+$, $\pi^-$, $p$, $\bar{p}$, $K^+$ and $K^-$. These measurements are presented as a function of laboratory momentum in intervals of laboratory polar angle covering the range from 0 to 450 mrad. They provide crucial inputs for current and future long-baseline neutrino experiments, where they are used to estimate the initial neutrino flux.</p>

<p>2023-06-05, <strong>Searching for DM induced neutrino signals in dSphs using 10 years of IceCube public data</strong>, Xue-Kang Guo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02675v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.02675v1</a></p>

<p>This study searches for neutrino signals from 18 dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) using 10 years of publicly available muon-track data of the IceCube neutrino observatory. We apply an unbinned likelihood analysis on each of these dSphs to derive the significance the putative neutrino emission. To further enhance our sensitivity, we also stack all dSphs together to perform a joint analysis. However, no significant neutrino emission signal was detected in either the single-source or stacking analysis. Based on these null results, we derive constraints on the annihilation cross section of dark matter particles. Compared to the existing literature, our constraints via the channel $\chi\chi\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ are comparable to the ones from the VERITAS observations of dSphs.</p>

<p>2023-06-04, <strong>Proton decay</strong>, Tommy Ohlsson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02401v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.02401v1</a></p>

<p>Proton decay is a hypothetical form of particle decay in which protons are assumed to decay into lighter particles. This form of decay has yet to be detected. In this contribution to the proceedings of Neutrino 2022, we review the current status of proton decay, covering both experimental results and theoretical models, including their predictions.</p>

<p>2023-06-04, <strong>CP violation in light neutrino oscillations and heavy neutrino decays: a general and explicit seesaw-bridged correlation</strong>, Zhi-zhong Xing et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02362v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.02362v1</a></p>

<p>With the help of a block parametrization of the canonical seesaw flavor textures in terms of the Euler-like rotation angles and CP-violaing phases, we derive a general and explicit expression for the Jarlskog invariant of CP violation in neutrino oscillations and compare it with the CP-violating asymmetries of heavy Majorana neutrino decays within the minimal seesaw framework which contains two right-handed neutrino fields. Two simplified scenarios are discussed to illustrate how direct or indirect the correlation between these two types of CP violation can be.</p>

<p>2023-06-05, <strong>Signatures of primordial black holes in gravitational wave clustering</strong>, Sarah Libanore et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03087v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.03087v1</a></p>

<p>The possible existence of primordial black holes (PBHs) is an open question in modern cosmology. Among the probes to test it, gravitational waves (GW) coming from their mergers constitute a powerful tool. In this work, we study how stellar mass PBH binaries could affect measurements of the clustering of merger events in future GW surveys. We account for PBH binaries formed both in the early and late Universe and show that the power spectrum modification they introduce can be detected at $\sim 2\sigma-3\sigma$ (depending on some assumptions) whenever PBH mergers make up at least $\sim 60\%$ of the overall number of detected events. By adding cross-correlations with galaxy surveys, this threshold is lowered to $\sim 40\%$. In the case of a poor redshift determination of GW sources, constraints are degraded by about a factor of 2. Assuming a theoretical model for the PBH merger rate, we can convert our results to constraints on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs, $f_{\rm PBH}$. Finally, we perform a Bayesian model selection forecast and confirm that the analysis we develop could be able to detect $\sim30M_\odot$ PBHs if they account for $f_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$, depending on the model uncertainty considered, being thus competitive with other probes.</p>

<p>2023-06-05, <strong>Constraining extended cosmologies with GW$\times$LSS cross-correlations</strong>, Michele Bosi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03031v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.03031v1</a></p>

<p>The rapid development of gravitational wave astronomy provides the unique opportunity of exploring the dynamics of the Universe using clustering properties of coalescing binary black hole mergers. Gravitational wave data, along with information coming from future galaxy surveys, have the potential of shedding light about many open questions in Cosmology, including those regarding the nature of dark matter and dark energy. In this work we explore which combination of gravitational wave and galaxy survey datasets are able to provide the best constraints both on modified gravity theories and on the nature of the very same binary black hole events. In particular, by using the public Boltzmann code \texttt{Multi\_CLASS}, we compare cosmological constraints on popular $\Lambda$CDM extensions coming from gravitational waves alone and in conjunction with either deep and localized or wide and shallow galaxy surveys. We show that constraints on extensions of General Relativity will be at the same level of existing limits from gravitational waves alone or one order of magnitude better when galaxy surveys are included. Furthermore, cross-correlating both kind of galaxy survey with gravitational waves datasets will allow to confidently rule in or out primordial black holes as dark matter candidate in the majority of the allowed parameter space.</p>

<p>2023-06-05, <strong>Growth rate of spherical voids with non-comoving Dark Matter and Baryons</strong>, Fernando A. Pizaña et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02668v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.02668v1</a></p>

<p>We present numerical solutions to Einstein’s equations describing large spherical cosmic voids constituted by two components; dark matter and baryons, with a non-vanishing initial relative velocity, in an asymptotically homogeneous background compatible with the $\Lambda$CDM concordance model. We compute numerically the evolution of such configurations in the dark matter frame, with a hypothetical homogeneous distribution of baryons, but respecting the values dictated by the concordance model for the average baryon-to-dark matter density ratio. We reproduce the well known formation of overdensities at the edge of the void, and recover the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi solutions in the comoving limit of our simulations. We compute the average growth factor of matter fluctuations, and find that it departs significantly from the linear perturbative prescription even in the comoving case, where the non-linearity of inhomogeneities has an impact.</p>

<p>2023-06-05, <strong>A new method to constrain annihilating dark matter</strong>, Man Ho Chan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02536v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.02536v1</a></p>

<p>Recent indirect searches of dark matter using gamma-ray, radio, and cosmic-ray data have provided some stringent constraints on annihilating dark matter. In this article, we propose a new indirect method to constrain annihilating dark matter. By using the data of the G2 cloud near the Galactic supermassive black hole Sgr A*, we can get stringent constraints on the parameter space of dark matter mass and the annihilation cross section, especially for the non-leptophilic annihilation channels $b\bar{b}$ and $W^{\pm}$. For the thermal annihilation cross section, the lower bounds of dark matter mass can be constrained up to TeV order for the non-leptophilic channels with the standard spike index $\gamma_{\rm sp}=7/3$.</p>

<p>2023-06-05, <strong>Deuterium Fractionation across the Infrared Dark Cloud G034.77-00.55 interacting with the Supernova Remnant W44</strong>, G. Cosentino et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02877v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2306.02877v1</a></p>

<p>Supernova remnants (SNRs) may regulate star formation in galaxies. For example, SNR-driven shocks may form new molecular gas or compress pre-existing clouds and trigger the formation of new stars. To test this scenario, we measure the deuteration of $N_2H^+$, $D_{frac}^{N_2H^+}$, a well-studied tracer of pre-stellar cores, across the Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G034.77-00.55, known to be experiencing a shock interaction with the SNR W44. We use N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ J=1-0 single pointing observations obtained with the 30m antenna at the Instituto de Radioastronomia Millimetrica to infer $D_{frac}^{N_2H^+}$ toward five positions across the cloud, namely a massive core, different regions across the shock front, a dense clump and ambient gas. We find $D_{frac}^{N_2H^+}$ in the range 0.03-0.1, several orders of magnitude larger than the cosmic D/H ratio ($\sim$10$^{-5}$). Across the shock front, $D_{frac}^{N_2H^+}$ is enhanced by more than a factor of 2 ($D_{frac}^{N_2H^+}\sim$0.05-0.07) with respect to the ambient gas ($\leq$0.03) and similar to that measured generally in pre-stellar cores. Indeed, in the massive core and dense clump regions of this IRDC we measure $D_{frac}^{N_2H^+}$}$\sim$0.1. We find enhanced deuteration of $N_2H^+$ across the region of the shock, at a level that is enhanced with respect to regions of unperturbed gas. It is possible that this has been induced by shock compression, which would then be indirect evidence that the shock is triggering conditions for future star formation. However, since unperturbed dense regions also show elevated levels of deuteration, further, higher-resolution studies are needed to better understand the structure and kinematics of the deuterated material in the shock region, e.g., if it still in relatively diffuse form or already organised in a population of low-mass pre-stellar cores.</p>
