<p>2023-07-03, <strong>HNL see-saw: lower mixing limit and pseudodegenerate state</strong>, Igor Krasnov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01190v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.01190v1</a></p>

<p>Heavy Neutral Leptons are popular hypothetical particles, first introduced as a way to explain neutrino oscillations, and since then extensively studied in relation to many other aspects of physics beyond the Standard Model. They also serve as viable targets for direct experimental searches, being effectively described only by HNL mass and mixing with each neutrino flavor. Motivated by this, we study the lower theoretical boundary for mixing with a specified flavor in two and three HNL cases. We find the connection of this limit with the effective neutrino mass appearing in neutrinoless double beta decay (and similar expressions for mixing with muon and tau neutrino). In two HNL case, there is a rather strict relation between mixing of different HNL with the same neutrino flavor. We find that existing exclusion regions and their expected expansions in the near future are all described by a certain limit. We call that limit pseudodegenerate and find its relation to the symmetrical limit, already studied in the literature. We also study pseudodegenerate limit and conditions under which it is achieved in three HNL case.</p>

<p>2023-07-03, <strong>Pinning down the leptophobic $Z^\prime$ in leptonic final states with Deep Learning</strong>, Tanumoy Mandal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01118v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.01118v1</a></p>

<p>A leptophobic $Z^\prime$ that does not couple with the Standard Model leptons can evade the stringent bounds from the dilepton-resonance searches. In our earlier paper [T. Arun et al., Search for the $Z’$ boson decaying to a right-handed neutrino pair in leptophobic $U(1)$ models, Phys. Rev. D, 106 (2022) 095035; arXiv:2204.02949], we presented two gauge anomaly-free $U(1)$ models where a heavy leptophobic $Z’$ is present along with right-handed neutrinos ($N_R$). We pointed out the interesting possibility of a correlated search for $Z’$ and $N_R$ at the LHC through the $pp\to Z’\to N_R N_R$ channel. This channel can probe a part of the leptophobic $Z’$ parameter space that cannot be otherwise probed using the standard dijet resonance searches. In this paper, we analyse the monolepton final state arising from the decay of the $N_R$ pair. We show that a leptophobic $Z’$ as heavy as $7$ TeV and with a gauge coupling of the order of the electroweak coupling is discoverable through this channel at the high-luminosity LHC.</p>

<p>2023-07-03, <strong>Estimating Galactic Diffuse Emission with LHAASO and IceCube Observation</strong>, Chengyu Shao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01038v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.01038v1</a></p>

<p>With the breakthrough in PeV gamma-ray astronomy brought by the LHAASO experiment, high-energy sky is getting more completed than before. Lately LHAASO Collaboration reported the observation of a gamma-ray diffuse emission with energy up to the PeV level from both the inner and outer Galactic plane. In these spectra, there is one bump which is hard to explain by the conventional cosmic-ray transport scenarios. Therefore, we introduce two extra components corresponding to unresolved sources with exponential-cutoff-power-law (ECPL) spectral shape, one with index of 2.4, and 30 TeV cutoff energy, and another with index of 2.3 and 2 PeV cutoff energy. With our constructed model, we simulate the Galactic diffuse neutrino flux and find our results are in full agreement with latest IceCube Galactic plane search. We estimate the Galactic neutrino contribute of $\sim 9\%$ of astrophysical neutrinos at 20 TeV. In the high-energy regime, as expected most of neutrinos observed by IceCube should be from extra-galaxy.</p>

<p>2023-07-03, <strong>Multi-messenger Observations of Tidal Disruption Events</strong>, Simeon Reusch et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00902v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.00902v1</a></p>

<p>Using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and other observatories, we have identified three candidate Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) in spatial and temporal coincidence with high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube: AT2019dsg, AT2019fdr and AT2019aalc. All three of these events have been shown to be able to produce high-energy neutrinos. In these proceedings, I will give an overview of Tidal Disruption Events, outline our follow-up program with ZTF, describe the observations carried out for each of those coincident events and highlight their similarities and differences.</p>

<p>2023-07-03, <strong>Analytical Constraints on the Radius and Bulk Lorentz Factor in the Lepto-Hadronic One-Zone Model of BL Lacs</strong>, ZhiPeng Ma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00737v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.00737v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we study the parameter space of neutrino-emitting BL Lacs under the framework of the one-zone lepto-hadronic model. We show that constraints on the model come from various aspects of observations such as the variability timescale of blazar flares, gamma-ray opacity and the spectral energy distribution of electromagnetic emission, as well as the inferred neutrino emissivity of the blazar. We apply our method to two potential neutrino sources, i.e., TXS 0506+056 and PKS 0735+178, which are BL Lacs. Then, we explore and summarize the allowed range of parameters such as the bulk Lorentz factor and the blob radius under different distributions of injected protons. We find that the parameter space that is available to explain the BL Lac–neutrino association is sensitive to the proton distribution, and usually, an injected proton luminosity significantly exceeding the Eddington luminosity is required for both sources. Our results suggest that the simple lepto-hadronic one-zone model may not be a reasonable interpretation for BL Lac–neutrino associations.</p>

<p>2023-07-03, <strong>An environment-dependent halo mass function as a driver for the early quenching of $z\geq1.5$ cluster galaxies</strong>, Syeda Lammim Ahad et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01147v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.01147v1</a></p>

<p>Many $z=1.5$ galaxies with a stellar mass ($M_{\star}$) $\geq 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ are already quenched in both galaxy clusters ($&gt;50$ per cent) and the field ($&gt;20$ per cent), with clusters having a higher quenched fraction at all stellar masses compared to the field. A puzzling issue is that these massive quenched galaxies have stellar populations of similar age in both clusters and the field. This suggests that, despite the higher quenched fraction in clusters, the dominant quenching mechanism for massive galaxies is similar in both environments. In this work, we use data from the cosmological hydrodynamic simulations Hydrangea and EAGLE to test whether the excess quenched fraction of massive galaxies in $z = 1.5$ clusters results from fundamental differences in their halo properties compared to the field. We find that (i) at $10^{10} \leq$ $M_{\star}/\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\leq 10^{11}$, quenched fractions in the redshift range $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$ are consistently higher for galaxies with higher peak maximum circular velocity of the dark matter halo ($v_{\mathrm{max, peak}}$), and (ii) the distribution of $v_{\mathrm{max, peak}}$ is strongly biased towards higher values for cluster satellites compared to the field centrals. Due to this difference in the halo properties of cluster and field galaxies, secular processes alone may account for (most of) the environmental excess of massive quenched galaxies in high-redshift (proto) clusters. Taken at face value, our results challenge a fundamental assumption of popular quenching models, namely that clusters are assembled from an unbiased subset of infalling field galaxies. If confirmed, this would imply that such models must necessarily fail at high redshift, as indicated by recent observations.</p>

<p>2023-07-03, <strong>Fuzzy Dark Matter, the Dark Dimension, and the Pulsar Timing Array Signal</strong>, Luis A. Anchordoqui et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01100v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.01100v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a new dark matter contender within the context of the so-called ``dark dimension’’, an innovative 5-dimensional construct that has a compact space with characteristic length-scale in the micron range. The new dark matter candidate is the radion, a bulk scalar field whose quintessence-like potential drives an inflationary phase described by a 5-dimensional de Sitter (or approximate) solution of Einstein equations. We show that the radion could be ultralight and thereby serve as a fuzzy dark matter candidate. We advocate a simple cosmological production mechanism bringing into play unstable Kaluza-Klein graviton towers which are fueled by the decay of the inflaton. We demonstrate that the fuzzy radion can accommodate the signal recently observed in pulsar timing arrays.</p>

<p>2023-07-03, <strong>Streamlined Lensed Quasar Identification in Multiband Images via Ensemble Networks</strong>, Irham Taufik Andika et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01090v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.01090v1</a></p>

<p>Quasars experiencing strong lensing offer unique viewpoints on subjects like the cosmic expansion rate, the dark matter profile within the foreground deflectors, and the quasar host galaxies. Unfortunately, identifying them in astronomical images is challenging since they are overwhelmed by the abundance of non-lenses. To address this, we have developed a novel approach by ensembling cutting-edge convolutional networks (CNNs) – i.e., ResNet, Inception, NASNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and RegNet – along with vision transformers (ViTs) trained on realistic galaxy-quasar lens simulations based on the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) multiband images. While the individual model exhibits remarkable performance when evaluated against the test dataset, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of $&gt;$97.4% and a median false positive rate of 3.1%, it struggles to generalize in real data, indicated by numerous spurious sources picked by each classifier. A significant improvement is achieved by averaging these CNNs and ViTs, resulting in the impurities being downsized by factors up to 40. Subsequently, combining the HSC images with the UKIRT, VISTA, and unWISE data, we retrieve approximately 60 million sources as parent samples and reduce this to 892,609 after employing a photometry preselection to discover $z&gt;1.5$ lensed quasars with Einstein radii of $\theta_\mathrm{E}&lt;5$ arcsec. Afterward, the ensemble classifier indicates 3991 sources with a high probability of being lenses, for which we visually inspect, yielding 161 prevailing candidates awaiting spectroscopic confirmation. These outcomes suggest that automated deep learning pipelines hold great potential in effectively detecting strong lenses in vast datasets with minimal manual visual inspection involved.</p>

<p>2023-07-03, <strong>Implications of Nano-Hertz Gravitational Waves on Electroweak Phase Transition in the Singlet Dark Matter Model</strong>, Yang Xiao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01072v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.01072v1</a></p>

<p>Inspired by the recent evidences of nano-Hertz stochastic gravitational waves observed by the pulsar timing array collaborations, we explore their implied supercooled electroweak phase transition in the singlet extension of the Standard Model. Our findings reveal that by adjusting the model parameter at per milli level, the corresponding percolation temperature can be continuously lowered to 1 GeV. With such a low percolation temperature, the singlet dark matter may freeze out before the electroweak phase transition, and, consequently, the entropy generated during the transition can significantly affect the dark matter relic density and other related constraints.</p>

<p>2023-07-03, <strong>Disk galaxies are self-similar: the universality of the HI-to-Halo mass ratio for isolated disks</strong>, Marie Korsaga et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01035v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.01035v1</a></p>

<p>Observed scaling relations in galaxies between baryons and dark matter global properties are key to shed light on the process of galaxy formation and on the nature of dark matter. Here, we study the scaling relation between the neutral hydrogen (HI) and dark matter mass in isolated rotationally-supported disk galaxies at low redshift. We first show that state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations predict that the HI-to-dark halo mass ratio decreases with stellar mass for the most massive disk galaxies. We then infer dark matter halo masses from high-quality rotation curve data for isolated disk galaxies in the local Universe, and report on the actual universality of the HI-to-dark halo mass ratio for these observed galaxies. This scaling relation holds for disks spanning a range of 4 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and 3 orders of magnitude in surface brightness. Accounting for the diversity of rotation curve shapes in our observational fits decreases the scatter of the HI-to-dark halo mass ratio while keeping it constant. This finding extends the previously reported discrepancy for the stellar-to-halo mass relation of massive disk galaxies within galaxy formation simulations to the realm of neutral atomic gas. Our result reveals that isolated galaxies with regularly rotating extended HI disks are surprisingly self-similar up to high masses, which hints at mass-independent self-regulation mechanisms that have yet to be fully understood.</p>

<p>2023-07-03, <strong>Origins of the north-south asymmetry in the ALFALFA HI velocity width function</strong>, Richard A. N. Brooks et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01007v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.01007v1</a></p>

<p>The number density of extragalactic 21-cm radio sources as a function of their spectral line-widths – the HI width function (HIWF) – is a tracer of the dark matter halo mass function. The ALFALFA 21-cm survey measured the HIWF in northern and southern Galactic fields finding a systematically higher number density in the north; an asymmetry which is in tension with $\Lambda$ cold dark matter models which predicts the HIWF should be identical everywhere if sampled in sufficiently large volumes. We use the Sibelius-DARK N-body simulation and semi-analytical galaxy formation model GALFORM to create mock ALFALFA surveys to investigate survey systematics. We find the asymmetry has two origins: the sensitivity of the survey is different in the two fields, and the algorithm used for completeness corrections does not fully account for biases arising from spatial galaxy clustering. Once survey systematics are corrected, cosmological models can be tested against the HIWF.</p>

<p>2023-07-03, <strong>Cosmic abundance of iron</strong>, Nikolai Chugai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00944v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.00944v1</a></p>

<p>I explore a possibility to estimate an upper limit of the current iron abundance of the barion matter. The upper limit is determined by the minimal iron abundance, at which the gamma-ray background, produced by the decay of $^{56}$Ni synthesised in the Universe to date, contradicts the observational MeV gamma-ray background. I calculate the gamma-ray background from SNe~Ia and SNe~II with the gamma-ray scattering and absorption in supernova envelope. It is shown that the model background does not contradict the observed MeV background, if the present day iron abundance of the barion matter is less than 15\% of the solar abundance.</p>

<p>2023-07-03, <strong>Binary Interaction Can Yield a Diversity of Circumstellar Media around Type II Supernova Progenitors</strong>, Tomoki Matsuoka et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00727v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.00727v1</a></p>

<p>Recent observations of supernovae (SNe) have indicated that a fraction of massive stars possess dense circumstellar medium (CSM) at the moment of their core collapses. They suggest the presence of additional activities of the SN progenitor driving the enhancement of the mass-loss rate, and some physical processes attributing to single star’s activities have been considered. In this study, we carry out binary evolutionary simulations of massive stars with the aim of investigating the CSM structure. We show that the mass-transfer rate in a binary can increase at the beginning of the Roche lobe overflow, and this enhancement would be associated with the structure of the CSM before the explosion. We also illustrate that depending on the orbital period of the binary, the density structure of the CSM can have a diverse distribution including shell-like and cliff-like structures. These characteristic structures appear within the lengthscale of $\sim 10^{17}\,{\rm cm}$ and could be traced by long-term observations of SNe, if the slow velocity of the CSM is assumed ($\sim 10\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$). Our results highlight the importance of binary interaction in the aspect of reproducing the diversity of the CSM configuration.</p>
