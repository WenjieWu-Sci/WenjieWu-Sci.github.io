<p>2024-11-26, <strong>Could the neutrino emission of TXS 0506+056 come from the accretion flow of the supermassive black hole?</strong>, Qi-Rui Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17632v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.17632v2</a></p>

<p>High-energy neutrinos from the blazar TXS~0506+056 are usually thought to arise from the relativistic jet pointing to us. However, the composition of jets of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), whether they are baryon dominated or Poynting flux dominated, is largely unknown. In the latter case, no comic rays and neutrinos are expected from the AGN jets. In this work, we study whether the neutrino emission from TXS~0506+056 could be powered by the accretion flow of the supermassive black hole. Protons could be accelerated by magnetic reconnection or turbulence in the inner accretion flow. To explain the neutrino flare of TXS~0506+056 in the year of 2014-2015, a super-Eddington accretion is needed. During the steady state, a sub-Eddington accretion flow could power a steady neutrino emission that may explain the long-term steady neutrino flux from TXS 0506+056. We consider the neutrino production in both magnetically arrested accretion (MAD) flow and the standard and normal evolution (SANE) regime of accretion. In the MAD scenario, due to a high magnetic field, a large dissipation radius is required to avoid the cooling of protons due to the synchrotron emission.</p>

<p>2024-11-26, <strong>Impact of Scalar NSI on Spatial and Temporal Correlations in Neutrino Oscillations</strong>, Bhavna Yadav et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17503v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.17503v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino oscillation experiments are gradually approaching an era of precision, where subleading effects can also be tested. One such subleading effect is Non-Standard Interactions (NSI), which can play a crucial role in neutrino oscillations. Various works have typically discussed vector NSI in the context of quantum correlations. Recently, there have been improvements in the bounds on scalar NSI as well. In light of these developments, we aim to examine the impact of scalar NSI on quantum correlation measures. To analyze this impact, we are considering the strongest measure of quantum correlation, i.e., non-locality. Our study will encompass both spatial and temporal non-locality measures.</p>

<p>2024-11-26, <strong>Phenomenology of Dirac neutrino EFTs up to dimension six</strong>, Anirban Biswas et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17414v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.17414v1</a></p>

<p>The gauge singlet right-handed neutrinos are one of the essential fields in neutrino mass models that explain tiny masses of active neutrinos. We consider the effective field theory of the Standard Model extended with these fields under the assumption that neutrinos are Dirac particles. In this framework, we provide a comprehensive study for the phenomenological consequences of various dimension six interactions employing various high and low energy observables such as the $pp\to\ell^\pm+\not{E}_T$, $pp\to j+\not{E}_T$, decays of proton, meson, tau and top, as well as the cosmological parameter $N_{\rm eff}$.</p>

<p>2024-11-26, <strong>Missing matter in galaxies as a neutrino mixing effect</strong>, Antonio Capolupo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17319v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.17319v1</a></p>

<p>We show that, in the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, the semiclassical energy-momentum tensor of the neutrino flavor vacuum fulfills the equation of state of dust and cold dark matter. We consider spherically symmetric spacetimes, and we demonstrate that, within the weak field approximation, the flavor vacuum contributes as a Yukawa correction to the Newtonian potential. This corrected potential may account for the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies. In this perspective, neutrino mixing could contribute to dark matter</p>

<p>2024-11-26, <strong>Parametric Resonance in RF Axion Haloscopes</strong>, Kiara Chantel Ruffin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17609v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.17609v1</a></p>

<p>The axion were proposed as a result to a solution to the Strong CP Problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and is now considered a leading candidate for dark matter. Direct axion dark matter detection experiments are challenging due to the axionâs weak interaction with electromagnetism. Recent work has suggested the possibility of an enhancement of astrophysical axion-to-photon decay through parametric resonance. We explore here the feasibility of using parametric resonance to enhance the signal in direct axion-like particle dark matter detectors.</p>

<p>2024-11-26, <strong>Using $ÎN_{\rm eff}$ to constrain preferred axion model dark matter</strong>, Andrew Cheek et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17320v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.17320v1</a></p>

<p>Preferred axion models are minimal realizations of the Peccei-Quinn solution to the strong CP problem while providing a dark matter candidate. These models invoke new heavy quarks that interact strongly with the Standard Model bringing them into thermal equilibrium in the early Universe. We show that for a number of these models, the heavy quarks will decay after axions have decoupled from the Standard Model thermal bath. As a consequence, any axion products in the decay form a component of dark radiation. This provides the potential to differentiate between preferred axion models through measurements of the number of relativistic degrees of freedom. The most sensitive of which comes from the Planck collaborationâs measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background. We find that existing constraints allow us to rule out regions of parameter space for 40% of preferred axion models.</p>

<p>2024-11-26, <strong>A Hybrid Scheme for Fuzzy Dark Matter Simulations Combining the SchrÃ¶dinger and Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung Equations</strong>, Alexander Kunkel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17288v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.17288v1</a></p>

<p>This paper introduces a hybrid numerical scheme for the fuzzy dark matter model: It combines a wave-based approach to solve the Schr"odinger equation using Fourier continuations with Gram polynomials and a fluid-based approach to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung equations. This hybrid scheme facilitates zoom-in simulations for cosmological volumes beyond the capabilities of wave-based solvers alone and accurately simulates the full nonlinear dynamics of fuzzy dark matter. We detail the implementation of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung solver, the methodology for phase matching at fluid-wave boundaries, the development of a local pseudospectral wave solver based on Fourier continuations, new grid refinement criteria for both fluid and wave solvers, an interpolation algorithm based on Fourier continuations, and the integration of these building blocks into the adaptive mesh refinement code GAMER. The superiority of the scheme is demonstrated through various performance and accuracy tests, tracking the linear power spectrum evolution in a 10 Mpc/h box, and a hybrid cosmological simulation in a 5.6 Mpc/h box. The corresponding code is published as part of the GAMER project on https://github.com/gamer-project/gamer.</p>

<p>2024-11-26, <strong>Probing vector gravitational atom with eccentric intermediate mass-ratio inspirals</strong>, Yan Cao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17247v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.17247v1</a></p>

<p>Ultralight bosons, proposed as candidates for dark matter, are predicted by various new physics models. In the presence of bosons with suitable masses, superradiant (SR) instability can naturally transform a spinning black hole (BH) into a gravitational atom (GA). Here we study the dynamics of intermediate mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) around a GA formed by ultralight vector field saturated in its SR ground state. We employ a perturbative model at the leading Newtonian order to consistently account for both the conservative effect of cloud gravity and the dissipative effect of cloud ionization. We find the cloud can make a sizable negative contribution to the secular periastron precession at binary separations comparable to the gravitational Bohr radius. Meanwhile, the backreaction of ionization could significantly accelerate the process of orbital decay and circularization. Considering reasonably small vector boson masses, we investigate the adiabatic orbital evolution and gravitational waveforms of eccentric inspirals. The results indicate that vector GAs might be detectable through observations of low-frequency IMRIs by future space-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and Taiji.</p>

<p>2024-11-26, <strong>Average X-ray properties of galaxy groups. From Milky Way-like halos to massive clusters</strong>, P. Popesso et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17120v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.17120v1</a></p>

<p>This study examines the average X-ray properties of massive halos at z&lt; 0.2, covering the largest halo mass range to date, from Milky Way-like halos to massive clusters. The analysis is based on stacking in the eFEDS area of the GAMA galaxy group sample, validated with synthetic data that mimic observed eROSITA X-ray and GAMA optical data using Magneticum lightcones. Stacking was conducted in halo mass bins and tested for AGN and X-ray binary contamination, systematics in the halo mass proxy, and uncertainties in optical group centers. The study provides average X-ray surface brightness profiles in six mass bins, spanning Milky Way-like systems to poor clusters. The scatter in the X-ray luminosity-mass (LX-M) relation is attributed to gas concentration: low X-ray luminosity systems at fixed halo mass exhibit lower central gas concentrations than high-luminosity systems, consistent with Magneticum predictions. However, discrepancies in dark matter concentration arise, with Magneticum predicting undetected groups as older and more relaxed, while observations suggest the opposite. New LX-M relations are presented covering three decades of halo mass. These relations fit a single power law, aligning with previous studies. Magneticum matches observed gas distributions across all masses, whereas IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, Simba, and FLAMINGO exhibit significant discrepancies at various mass scales. Simulations calibrated on local galaxy properties accurately reproduce central galaxies but fail to capture gas properties. Conversely, simulations like Magneticum excel in gas predictions but produce overly massive central galaxies. Further exploration of gas and dark matter distributions and their effects on galaxy properties is critical to comprehending the role of gravitational forces and feedback in shaping large-scale structure and galaxy evolution.</p>

<p>2024-11-26, <strong>XTE J1814-338 as a dark matter admixed neutron star</strong>, Luiz L. Lopes et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17105v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.17105v1</a></p>

<p>The existence of the ultracompact object XTE J1814-338, with an inferred mass and radius of $M$ = 1.21 $\pm$ 0.05 $M_\odot$ and R = 7.0 $\pm$ 0.4 km, presents a great challenge for the theory of neutron stars. Within this context, we revisit the theory of dark-matter-admixed neutron stars and infer the physical properties of this compact object, such as the Fermi momentum of dark matter necessary to compress the star at such low radius, its equation of state, speed of sound, and some macroscopic properties, such as the inertia moment and the dimensionless tidal parameter. We also compare the physical properties of the XTE J1814-338 with other pulsars, such as the canonical 1.4 M$_\odot$, the PSR J0740 + 6620, and the HESS J1731-347.</p>

<p>2024-11-26, <strong>Analytical modeling of the one-dimensional power spectrum of 21-cm forest based on a halo model method</strong>, Yue Shao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17094v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.17094v1</a></p>

<p>The 21-cm forest, composed of spectral absorption features from high-redshift background radio sources, provides a unique probe for studying small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization. It is particularly sensitive to detecting small-scale structures and early heating processes. Despite the rich information contained in the 21-cm forest signal, the complexity of directly modeling the signal has led to a lack of effective analytical models. However, the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest contains valuable information about the matter power spectrum, making analytical modeling feasible. This work employs an analytical modeling approach based on the halo model, which links the distribution of matter to dark matter halos, allowing for effective predictions of cosmic structure formation and its impact on the 21-cm signal. By considering various parameter scenarios within the halo model framework, particularly different dark matter particle masses and varying levels of cosmic heating, we can capture the complexities of small-scale structures and make the 1D power spectrum modeling applicable across a wide range of parameters. This method not only enhances our understanding of the 21-cm forest signal but also provides theoretical support for future observational data. Observing the 21-cm forest with large radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array, is anticipated to enable simultaneous exploration of dark matter properties and the heating history of the early universe.</p>

<p>2024-11-26, <strong>The BINGO/ABDUS Project: Forecast for cosmological parameter from a mock Fast Radio Bursts survey</strong>, Xue Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17516v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.17516v1</a></p>

<p>There are hosts of surveys that will provide excellent data to search for and locate Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) at cosmological distances. The BINGO project is one such surveys, and this collaboration has already estimated a FRB detection rate that the project will yield with the main telescope helped by a set of outrigger stations. This paper aims to simulate and estimate the potential of FRBs in constraining our current cosmological model. We present a forecast of the future constraints that the BINGO FRB detections and localizations will have when added to other current cosmological datasets. We quantify the dispersion measure (DM) as a function of redshift ($z$) for the BINGO FRB mock sample. Furthermore, we use current datasets (Supernovae, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Microwave Background data) prior to assessing the efficacy of constraining dark energy models using Monte Carlo methods. Our results show that spatially located BINGO FRB dataset will provide promising constraints on the population of host galaxies intrinsic DM and be able to measure the nuisance parameters present within a FRB cosmological analysis. Still, they will also provide alternative estimates on other parameters such as the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation of state. In particular, we should see that BINGO FRB data can put constraints on the degenerate $w-H_0$ plane, which the CMB is incapable of measuring, allowing FRBs to be a viable alternative to BAO to constrain the dark energy equation of state. We conclude that FRBs remain a promising future probe for cosmology and that the FRBs detected by the BINGO project will contribute significantly to our knowledge of the current cosmological model.</p>

<p>2024-11-26, <strong>Mass Transfer Physics in Binary Stars and Applications in Gravitational Wave Sources</strong>, Hongwei Ge et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17333v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.17333v1</a></p>

<p>The stability criteria of rapid mass transfer and common-envelope evolution are fundamental in binary star evolution. They determine the mass, mass ratio, and orbital distribution of many important systems, such as X-ray binaries, type Ia supernovae, and merging gravitational-wave sources. In the limit of extremely rapid mass transfer, the response of a donor star in an interacting binary becomes asymptotically one of adiabatic expansion. We built the adiabatic mass-loss model and systematically surveyed the thresholds for dynamical timescale mass transfer over the entire span of possible donor star evolutionary states. Many studies indicate that new mass transfer stability thresholds play an essential role in the formation and properties of double compact object populations and the progenitors of SNe Ia and detectable GW sources. For example, our studies show that the mass transfer in the red giant and the asymptotic giant branch stars and the massive stars can be more stable than previously believed. Consequently, detailed binary population synthesis studies, using updated unstable mass transfer criteria, predicate the non-conservative stable mass transfer may dominate the formation channel of double stellar-mass black holes and can explain the population of the large mass ratio double stellar-mass black holes. Using our updated mass transfer thresholds, binary population thesis studies by Li et al. show that Ge et al.âs results support the observational double white dwarfs merger rate distribution per Galaxy and the space density of double white dwarfs in the Galaxy.</p>

<p>2024-11-26, <strong>Constraints on color-flavored locked quark matter in view of the HESS J1731-347 event</strong>, K. Kourmpetis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17234v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.17234v1</a></p>

<p>Understanding the processes within compact stars hinges on astrophysical observations. A recent study reported on the central object in the HESS J1731-347 supernova remnant (SNR), estimating a mass of $M=0.77_{-0.17}^{+0.20} \ M_{\odot}$ and a radius of $R=10.40_{-0.78}^{+0.86} \ \rm{km}$, making it the lightest neutron star ever observed. Conventional models suggest that neutron stars form with a minimum gravitational mass of about $1.17M_{\odot}$, raising the question: is this object a typical neutron star, or could it be our first encounter with an âexoticâ star? To explore this, we employ the Color-Flavored Locked (CFL) equation of state (EoS), aiming to constrain it by integrating data from the HESS J1731-347 event with pulsar observations and gravitational wave detections. Additionally, we model hybrid EoS by combining the MDI-APR1 (hadronic) and CFL (quark) EoS, incorporating phase transitions via Maxwell construction. Our analysis indicates that CFL quark matter adequately explains all measurements, including the central compact object of HESS J1731-347. In contrast, hybrid models featuring CFL quark phases fail to account for the masses of the most massive observed pulsars.</p>

<p>2024-11-26, <strong>SN 2014C: a metamorphic supernova exploded in the intricate and hydrogen-rich surroundings</strong>, Qian Zhai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17008v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.17008v2</a></p>

<p>We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2014C, primarily emphasizing the initial month after the explosion at approximately daily intervals. During this time, it was classified as a Type Ib SN exhibiting a notably higher peak luminosity ($L_{\rm peak}\approx4.3\times10^{42}\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), a faster rise to brightness ($t_{\rm rise} \approx 11.6$ d), and a more gradual dimming ($\Delta m_{15}^{V} \approx 0.48$ mag) compared to typical SNe Ib. Analysis of the velocity evolution over the first $\sim$ 20 days after the explosion supports the view that the absorption near 6200\AA is due to high-velocity H$\alpha$ in the outer layers of the ejecta, indicating the presence of a small amount of hydrogen in the envelope of progenitor before the explosion. Assuming the peak luminosity is entirely attributed to radioactive decay, we estimate that 0.14 ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ of$^{56}$Ni was synthesized in the explosion. However, this amount of nickel could no longer maintain observed brightness approximately ten days after peak luminosity, suggesting additional energy sources beyond radioactive decay. This supplementary energy likely originates from interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Consequently, the timing of the SN-CSM interaction in SN 2014C may occur much earlier than the emergence of IIn-like features during the nebular phase.</p>
