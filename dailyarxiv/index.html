<p>2023-09-07, <strong>Neutron star cooling with lepton-flavor-violating axions</strong>, Hong-Yi Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03889v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03889v1</a></p>

<p>The cores of dense stars are a powerful laboratory for studying feebly-coupled particles such as axions. Some of the strongest constraints on axionlike particles and their couplings to ordinary matter derive from considerations of stellar axion emission. In this work we study the radiation of axionlike particles from degenerate neutron star matter via a lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) coupling that leads to muon-electron conversion when an axion is emitted. We calculate the axion emission rate per unit volume (emissivity) and by comparing with the rate of neutrino emission, we infer upper limits on the LFV coupling that are at the level of $|g_{ae\mu}| \lesssim 10^{-6}$. For the hotter environment of a supernova, such as SN 1987A, the axion emission rate is enhanced and the limit is stronger, at the level of $|g_{ae\mu}| \lesssim 10^{-11}$, competitive with laboratory limits. Interestingly, our derivation of the axion emissivity reveals that axion emission via the LFV coupling is suppressed relative to the familiar lepton-flavor-preserving channels by a factor of $T^2 E_{F,e}^2 / (m_\mu^2 - m_e^2)^2 \sim T^2/m_\mu^2$, which is responsible for the relatively weaker limits.</p>

<p>The currently accepted mathematical description of the fundamental constituents and interactions of matter is the Standard Model of particle physics. Its last missing particle, the famous Higgs boson, was observed at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in 2012. However, it is clear that the Standard Model cannot be the ultimate theory of Nature, and e.g. cannot account for Dark Matter or non-vanishing neutrino masses (and does not include gravity). In fact, searches for physics beyond the SM have been intensified since the Higgs boson discovery. In this article, we review the hints for new physics, called ``anomalies’’, obtained in particle physics experiments within the last years. We consider both direct high-energy searches for new resonances at the LHC and indirect low-energy precision experiments. These anomalies range from the nuclear scale (approximately the mass of the proton) to the electroweak scale (i.e. the mass of the Higgs boson) to the TeV scale (the highest scale directly accessible at the LHC), therefore spanning over four orders of magnitude. After discussing the experimental and theoretical status of the anomalies, we summarize possible explanations in terms of new particles and new interactions. In particular, new Higgs bosons and leptoquarks are promising candidates. Discovery prospects and implications for future colliders are discussed.</p>

<p>2023-09-07, <strong>General-relativistic radiation transport scheme in Gmunu II: Implementation of novel microphysical library for neutrino radiation – Weakhub</strong>, Harry Ho-Yin Ng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03526v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03526v1</a></p>

<p>We introduce \texttt{Weakhub}, a novel neutrino microphysics library that provides opacities and kernels beyond conventional interactions used in the literature. This library includes neutrino-matter, neutrino-photon, and neutrino-neutrino interactions, along with corresponding weak and strong corrections. A full kinematics approach is adopted for the calculations of $\beta$-processes, incorporating various weak corrections and medium modifications due to the nuclear equation of state. Calculations of plasma processes, electron neutrino-antineutrino annihilation, and nuclear de-excitation are included. We also present the detailed derivations of weak interactions and the coupling of them to the two-moment based general-relativistic multi-group radiation transport in the \texttt{G}eneral-relativistic \texttt{mu}ltigrid \texttt{nu}merical (\texttt{Gmunu}) code. We compare the neutrino opacity spectra for all interactions and estimate their contributions at hydrodynamical points in core-collapse supernova and binary neutron star postmerger remnant, and predict the effects of improved opacities in comparison to conventional ones for a binary neutron star postmerger at a specific hydrodynamical point. We test the implementation of the conventional set of interactions by comparing it to an open-source neutrino library \texttt{NuLib} in a core-collapse supernova simulation. We demonstrate good agreement with discrepancies of less than $\sim 10\%$ in luminosity for all neutrino species, while also highlighting the reasons contributing to the differences. To compare the advanced interactions to the conventional set in core-collapse supernova modelling, we perform simulations to analyze their impacts on neutrino signatures, hydrodynamical behaviors, and shock dynamics, showing significant deviations.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>Neutrinos and gamma-rays from Galaxy Clusters constrained by the upper limits of IceCube</strong>, Saqib Hussain et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03372v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03372v1</a></p>

<p>Clusters of galaxies possess the capability to accelerate cosmic rays (CRs) to very high energy up to $\sim10^{18}$~eV due to their large size and magnetic field strength which favor CR confinement for cosmological times. During their confinement, they can produce neutrinos and $\gamma-$rays out of interactions with the background gas and photon fields. In recent work, \cite{hussain2021high, hussain2023diffuse} have conducted three-dimensional cosmological magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of the turbulent intracluster medium (ICM) combined with multi-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of CR propagation for redshifts ranging from $z \sim 5$ to $z = 0$ to study the multi-messenger emission from these sources. They found that when CRs with a spectral index in the range $1.5 - 2.5$ and cutoff energy $E_\mathrm{max} = 10^{16} - 10^{17}$~eV are injected into the system, they make significant contributions to the diffuse background emission of both neutrinos and gamma-rays. In this work, we have revisited this model and undertaken further constraints on the parametric space. This was achieved by incorporating the recently established upper limits on neutrino emission from galaxy clusters, as obtained by the IceCube experiment. We find that for CRs injected with spectral indices in the range $2.0 - 2.5$, cutoff energy $E_\mathrm{max} = 10^{16} - 10^{17}$~eV, and power corresponding to $(0.1-1)\%$ of the cluster luminosity, our neutrino flux aligns with the upper limits estimated by IceCube. Additionally, the resulting contribution from clusters to the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background (DGRB) remains significant with values of the order of $ \sim 10^{-5}\, \mathrm{MeV} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \,\mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{sr}^{-1}$ at energies above $500$ GeV.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>CP-Violation with Neutrino Disappearance</strong>, Peter B. Denton et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03262v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03262v1</a></p>

<p>The best way to probe CP violation in the lepton sector is with long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments in the appearance mode: the appearance of $\nu_e$ in predominantly $\nu_\mu$ beams. Here we show that it is possible to discover CP violation with disappearance experiments only, by combining JUNO for electron neutrinos and DUNE or Hyper-Kamiokande for muon neutrinos. While the maximum sensitivity to discover CP is quite modest ($1.6\sigma$ with 6 years of JUNO and 13 years of DUNE), some values of $\delta$ may be disfavored by $&gt;3\sigma$ depending on the true value of $\delta$.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>$\mathbf{12\times2}$pt combined probes: pipeline, neutrino mass, and data compression</strong>, Alexander Reeves et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03258v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03258v1</a></p>

<p>With the rapid advance of wide-field surveys it is increasingly important to perform combined cosmological probe analyses. We present a new pipeline for simulation-based multi-probe analyses, which combines tomographic large-scale structure (LSS) probes (weak lensing and galaxy clustering) with cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary and lensing data. These are combined at the $C_\ell$-level, yielding 12 distinct auto- and cross-correlations. The pipeline is based on $\texttt{UFalconv2}$, a framework to generate fast, self-consistent map-level realizations of cosmological probes from input lightcones, which is applied to the $\texttt{CosmoGridV1}$ N-body simulation suite. It includes a non-Gaussian simulation-based covariance, several data compression schemes, and a neural network emulator for accelerated theoretical predictions. We validate our framework, apply it to a simulated $12\times2$pt tomographic analysis of KiDS, BOSS, and $\textit{Planck}$, and forecast constraints for a $\Lambda$CDM model with a variable neutrino mass. We find that, while the neutrino mass constraints are driven by the CMB data, the addition of LSS data helps to break degeneracies and improves the constraint by up to 35%. For a fiducial $M_\nu=0.15\mathrm{eV}$, a full combination of the above CMB+LSS data would enable a $3\sigma$ constraint on the neutrino mass. We explore data compression schemes and find that MOPED outperforms PCA. We also study the impact of an internal lensing tension, parametrized by $A_L$, on the neutrino mass constraint, finding that the addition of LSS to CMB data including all cross-correlations is able to mitigate the impact of this systematic. $\texttt{UFalconv2}$ and a MOPED compressed $\textit{Planck}$ CMB primary + CMB lensing likelihood are made publicly available.

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>Demonstration of particle tracking with scintillating fibres read out by a SPAD array sensor and application as a neutrino active target</strong>, Matthew Franks et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03131v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03131v1</a></p>

<p>Scintillating fibre detectors combine sub-mm resolution particle tracking, precise measurements of the particle stopping power and sub-ns time resolution. Typically, fibres are read out with silicon photomultipliers (SiPM). Hence, if fibres with a few hundred mm diameter are used, either they are grouped together and coupled with a single SiPM, losing spatial resolution, or a very large number of electronic channels is required. In this article we propose and provide a first demonstration of a novel configuration which allows each individual scintillating fibre to be read out regardless of the size of its diameter, by imaging them with Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) array sensors. Differently from SiPMs, SPAD array sensors provide single-photon detection with single-pixel spatial resolution. In addition, O(us) or faster coincidence of detected photons allows to obtain noise-free images. Such a concept can be particularly advantageous if adopted as a neutrino active target, where scintillating fibres alternated along orthogonal directions can provide isotropic, high-resolution tracking in a dense material and reconstruct the kinematics of low-momentum protons (down to 150 MeV/c), crucial for an accurate characterisation of the neutrino nucleus cross section. In this work the tracking capabilities of a bundle of scintillating fibres coupled to SwissSPAD2 is demonstrated. The impact of such detector configuration in GeV-neutrino experiments is studied with simulations and reported. Finally, future plans, including the development of a new SPAD array sensor optimised for neutrino detection, are discussed.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>The Spectra of IceCube Neutrino (SIN) candidate sources – IV. Spectral energy distributions and multi-wavelength variability</strong>, Martina Karl et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03119v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03119v1</a></p>

<p>We present hybrid spectral energy distributions, combining photon and neutrino fluxes, for a sample of blazars, which are candidate IceCube neutrino sources. We furthermore check for differences in our sources’ variability in the near-infrared, optical, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands compared to a sample of non-neutrino source candidate blazars, and investigate the state of each blazar at the arrival time of high-energy neutrinos. We find no significant differences when comparing our sample with control sources, also in terms of their spectral energy distributions, and no correlation between flaring states and neutrino arrival times. Looking for signatures of hadronic production, we check for similar strengths of the $\gamma$-ray and neutrino fluxes and find a $2.2\,\sigma$ signal for our source candidates. The hybrid spectral energy distributions assembled here will form the basis of the next step of our project, namely lepto-hadronic modelling of these blazars to assess the physical likelihood of a neutrino connection.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>Correlating high-energy IceCube neutrinos with 5BZCAT blazars and RFC sources</strong>, Chiara Bellenghi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03115v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03115v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the possibility that blazars in the Roma-BZCAT Multifrequency Catalogue of Blazars (5BZCAT) are sources of the high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, as recently suggested by Buson et al. (2022a,b). Although we can reproduce their $\sim 4.6\, \sigma$ result, which applies to 7 years of neutrino data in the Southern sky, we find no significant correlation with 5BZCAT sources when extending the search to the Northern sky, where IceCube is most sensitive to astrophysical signals. To further test this scenario, we use a larger sample consisting of 10 years of neutrino data recently released by the IceCube collaboration, this time finding no significant correlation in either the Southern or the Northern sky. These results suggest that the strong correlation reported by Buson et al. (2022a,b) using 5BZCAT could be due to a statistical fluctuation and possibly the spatial and flux non-uniformities in the blazar sample. We perform some additional correlation tests using the more uniform, flux-limited, and blazar-dominated Radio Fundamental Catalogue (RFC) and find a $\sim 3.2\sigma$ equivalent p-value when correlating it with the 7-year Southern neutrino sky. However, this correlation disappears completely when extending the analysis to the Northern sky and when analyzing 10 years of all-sky neutrino data. Our findings support a scenario where the contribution of the whole blazar class to the IceCube signal is relevant but not dominant, in agreement with most previous studies.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>Prospects for combined analyses of hadronic emission from $γ$-ray sources in the Milky Way with CTA and KM3NeT</strong>, T. Unbehaun et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03007v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03007v1</a></p>

<p>The Cherenkov Telescope Array and the KM3NeT neutrino telescopes are major upcoming facilities in the fields of $\gamma$-ray and neutrino astronomy, respectively. Possible simultaneous production of $\gamma$ rays and neutrinos in astrophysical accelerators of cosmic-ray nuclei motivates a combination of their data. We assess the potential of a combined analysis of CTA and KM3NeT data to determine the contribution of hadronic emission processes in known Galactic $\gamma$-ray emitters, comparing this result to the cases of two separate analyses. In doing so, we demonstrate the capability of Gammapy, an open-source software package for the analysis of $\gamma$-ray data, to also process data from neutrino telescopes. For a selection of prototypical $\gamma$-ray sources within our Galaxy, we obtain models for primary proton and electron spectra in the hadronic and leptonic emission scenario, respectively, by fitting published $\gamma$-ray spectra. Using these models and instrument response functions for both detectors, we employ the Gammapy package to generate pseudo data sets, where we assume 200 hours of CTA observations and 10 years of KM3NeT detector operation. We then apply a three-dimensional binned likelihood analysis to these data sets, separately for each instrument and jointly for both. We find that the largest benefit of the combined analysis lies in the possibility of a consistent modelling of the $\gamma$-ray and neutrino emission. Assuming a purely leptonic scenario as input, we obtain, for the most favourable source, an average expected 68% credible interval that constrains the contribution of hadronic processes to the observed $\gamma$-ray emission to below 15%.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>Traceless Texture of Neutrino Mass Matrix</strong>, N. Chamoun et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03001v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03001v1</a></p>

<p>We study a neutrino mass matrix texture characterized by a vanishing trace. We highlight the role played by the phases, physical and non-physical, and undergo a thorough phenomenological analysis, first (second) when the non-physical (CP) phases are vanishing, then move on to the general case where all phases exist. Finally we present a theoretical realization of the texture based on $A_5$ non-abelian flavor symmetry.</p>

<p>Belle II recently reported the first measurement of $B^+\to K^++\mathrm{inv}$, which is $2.8\sigma$ above the Standard Model prediction. We explore the available parameter space of new physics within Standard Model effective field theory extended by sterile neutrinos ($\nu$SMEFT) and provide predictions for the other $B\to K^{(\star)}+\mathrm{inv}$ decay modes and invisible $B_s$ decays. We also briefly comment on charged current decays $B\to D^{(\star)}\ell\bar\nu$ and possible ultraviolet completions of the relevant $\nu$SMEFT operators.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>Stochastic modelling of cosmic ray sources for diffuse high-energy gamma-rays and neutrinos</strong>, Anton Stall et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02860v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.02860v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmic rays of energies up to a few PeV are believed to be of galactic origin, yet individual sources have still not been firmly identified. Due to inelastic collisions with the interstellar gas, cosmic-ray nuclei produce a diffuse flux of high-energy gamma-rays and neutrinos. Fermi-LAT has provided maps of galactic gamma-rays at GeV energies which can be produced by both hadronic and leptonic processes. Neutrinos, on the other hand, are exclusively produced by the sought-after hadronic processes, yet they can be detected above backgrounds only at hundreds of TeV. Oftentimes, diffuse emission maps are extrapolated from GeV to PeV energies, but the sources contributing at either energies likely differ. We have modelled the production of diffuse emission from GeV through PeV energies in a Monte Carlo approach, taking into consideration the discrete nature of sources. We can generate realisations of the diffuse sky in a matter of seconds, thus allowing for characterising correlations in direction and energy. At hundreds of TeV, relevant for observations with LHAASO, Tibet AS-gamma, IceCube and the upcoming SWGO, variations between different realisations are sizeable. Specifically, we show that extrapolations of diffuse emission from GeV to PeV energies must fail and apply our results on the recent experimental findings.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>Atomic electron shell excitations in double-$β$ decay</strong>, M. I. Krivoruchenko et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02850v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.02850v1</a></p>

<p>The problem of the transition of electron shells of atoms to excited states in the process of neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay is investigated. This subject is crucial for modeling the energy spectrum of $\beta$-electrons, which is sensitive to the mass and Majorana nature of neutrinos. The dependence of the obtained results on the atomic number indicates the determining role of the Feinberg–Migdal effect in the electron shell excitations. We report the overlap amplitudes of the electron shells of the parent atom and the daughter ion for eleven atoms, the two-neutrino double-$\beta$ decay of which was observed experimentally. In around one-fourth of the cases where the structure of the electron shells is inherited from the parent atom, there is a transition to the ground state or the excited state with the lowest energy. The de-excitation of the daughter ion in the latter scenario is accompanied by the emission of photons in the ultraviolet range, which can serve as an auxiliary signature of double-$\beta$ decay. The average excitation energy of the electron shells ranges between 300 and 800 eV, with the variance ranging from $(1.7~\mathrm{keV})^2$ in calcium to $(14~\mathrm{keV})^2$ in uranium.</p>

<p>Heavy WIMP (weakly-interacting-massive-particle) effective field theory is used to compute the WIMP-nucleon scattering rate for general heavy electroweak multiplets through order $m_W/M$, where $m_W$ and $M$ denote the electroweak and WIMP mass scales. The lightest neutral component of such an electroweak multiplet is a candidate dark matter particle, either elementary or composite. Existing computations for certain representations of electroweak $\mathrm{SU(2)}_W\times \mathrm{U(1)}_Y$ reveal a cancellation of amplitudes from different effective operators at leading and subleading orders in $1/M$, yielding small cross sections that are below current dark matter direct detection experimental sensitivities. We extend those computations and consider all low-spin (spin-0, spin-1/2, spin-1, spin-3/2) heavy electroweak multiplets with arbitrary $\mathrm{SU(2)}_W\times \mathrm{U(1)}_Y$ representations and provide benchmark cross section results for dark matter direct detection experiments. For most self-conjugate TeV WIMPs with isospin $\le 3$, the cross sections are below current experimental limits but within reach of next-generation experiments. An exception is the case of pure electroweak doublet, where WIMPs are hidden below the neutrino floor.</p>

<p>We study the effect of asymmetric fermionic dark matter (DM) on the thermal evolution of neutron stars (NSs). No interaction between DM and baryonic matter is assumed, except the gravitational one. Using the two-fluid formalism, we show that DM accumulated in the core of a star pulls inwards the outer baryonic layers of the star, increasing the baryonic density in the NS core. As a result, it significantly affects the star’s thermal evolution by triggering an early onset of the direct Urca process and modifying the photon emission from the surface caused by the decrease of the radius. Thus, due to the gravitational pull of DM, the direct Urca process becomes kinematically allowed for stars with lower masses. Based on these results, we discuss the importance of NS observations at different distances from the Galactic center. Since the DM distribution peaks towards the Galactic center, NSs in this region are expected to contain higher DM fractions that could lead to a different cooling behavior.</p>

<p>2023-09-07, <strong>Constraining Hot Dark Matter Sub-Species with Weak Lensing and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation</strong>, Fabian Hervas Peters et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03865v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03865v1</a></p>

<p>Although it is well known that the bulk of dark matter (DM) has to be cold, the existence of an additional sub-dominant, hot species remains a valid possibility. In this paper we investigate the potential of the cosmic shear power spectrum to constrain such a mixed (hot plus cold) DM scenario with two additional free parameters, the hot-to-total DM fraction ($f_{\rm hdm}$) and the thermal mass of the hot component ($m_{\rm hdm}$). Running a Bayesian inference analysis for both the Kilo-Degree Survey cosmic shear data (KiDS) as well as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarisation data from Planck, we derive new constraints for the mixed DM scenario. We find a 95 per cent confidence limit of $f_{\rm hdm}&lt;0.08$ for a very hot species of $m_{\rm hdm}\leq20$ eV. This constraint is weakened to $f_{\rm hdm}&lt;0.25$ for $m_{\rm hdm}\leq80$ eV. Scenarios with masses above $m_{\rm hdm}\sim200$ eV remain unconstrained by the data. Next to providing limits, we investigate the potential of mixed DM to address the clustering (or $S_8$) tension between lensing and the CMB. We find a reduction of the 2D ($\Omega_m - S_8$) tension from 2.9$\sigma$ to 1.6$\sigma$ when going from a pure cold DM to a mixed DM scenario. When computing the 1D gaussian tension on $S_8$ the improvement is milder, from 2.4$\sigma$ to 2.0$\sigma$.</p>

<p>Galaxy clusters are expected to be dark matter (DM) reservoirs and storage rooms for the cosmic-ray protons (CRp) that accumulate along the cluster’s formation history. Accordingly, they are excellent targets to search for signals of DM annihilation and decay at gamma-ray energies and are predicted to be sources of large-scale gamma-ray emission due to hadronic interactions in the intracluster medium. We estimate the sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) to detect diffuse gamma-ray emission from the Perseus galaxy cluster. We perform a detailed spatial and spectral modelling of the expected signal for the DM and the CRp components. For each, we compute the expected CTA sensitivity. The observing strategy of Perseus is also discussed. In the absence of a diffuse signal (non-detection), CTA should constrain the CRp to thermal energy ratio within the radius $R_{500}$ down to about $X_{500}&lt;3\times 10^{-3}$, for a spatial CRp distribution that follows the thermal gas and a CRp spectral index $\alpha_{\rm CRp}=2.3$. Under the optimistic assumption of a pure hadronic origin of the Perseus radio mini-halo and depending on the assumed magnetic field profile, CTA should measure $\alpha_{\rm CRp}$ down to about $\Delta\alpha_{\rm CRp}\simeq 0.1$ and the CRp spatial distribution with 10% precision. Regarding DM, CTA should improve the current ground-based gamma-ray DM limits from clusters observations on the velocity-averaged annihilation cross-section by a factor of up to $\sim 5$, depending on the modelling of DM halo substructure. In the case of decay of DM particles, CTA will explore a new region of the parameter space, reaching models with $\tau_{\chi}&gt;10^{27}$s for DM masses above 1 TeV. These constraints will provide unprecedented sensitivity to the physics of both CRp acceleration and transport at cluster scale and to TeV DM particle models, especially in the decay scenario.</p>

<p>We study the decay of $B^+$ meson into $K^+$ plus a light mediator $\phi$ followed by production of dark matter (DM) pair $\bar \chi \chi$, which can mimic the flavor changing neural current (FCNC) process of $B^+ \rightarrow K^+ \nu \bar \nu$ in the standard model (SM). Constraints from DM relic density, direct detection, collider and $B-$physics data combined with the recently reported $B^+\rightarrow K^+ \nu \bar \nu$ branching ratio performed at the Belle II experiment, we analyse couplings between the mediator and the SM fermions as well as the dark matter particle. We obtain that: if the process $\phi \rightarrow \bar \chi \chi$ is kinematically allowed, i.e. $m_\phi &gt; 2m_\chi$, then $m_\phi$ should be larger than mass of the muon pair; Otherwise, $\phi$ should play the role of missing energy, and only allowed decaying channel is $\phi \rightarrow e^+ e^-$.</p>

<p>The open problems related to cosmological tensions in current times have opened new paths to study new probes to constrain cosmological parameters in standard and extended cosmologies, in particular, to determine at a local level the value of the Hubble constant $H_0$, through independent techniques. However, while standard Cosmological Constant Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model has been well constrained and parts of extended cosmology have been intensively studied, the physics behind them aspects restrains our possibilities of selecting the best cosmological model that can show a significant difference from the first model. Therefore, to explore a possible deviation from a such model that can explain the current discrepancy on the $H_0$ value, in this work we consider adding the current local observables, e.g. Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), $H(z)$ measurements, and Baryon Acoustic Observations (BAO) combined with two new calibrated Quasars (QSO) datasets using ultraviolet, x-ray and optical plane techniques. While these can be identified as part of the high-redshift standard candle objects, the main characteristics of these are based on fluxes distributions calibrated up to $z \sim 7 $. We consider five $H_0$ prior scenarios to develop these calibrations. Furthermore, we found that our estimations provide the possibility to relax the $H_0$ tension at 2$\sigma$ using a QSO ultraviolet sample in combination with late measurements showing higher values of $H_0$. Our results can be an initial start for more serious treatments in the quasars physics from ultraviolet, x-ray, and optical plane techniques behind the local observations as cosmological probes to relax the cosmological tensions problems.</p>

<p>Axions and axion-like particles are well-motivated dark matter candidates. We propose an experiment that uses single photon detection interferometry to search for axions and axion-like particles in the galactic halo. We show that photon counting with a dark rate of 6E-6 Hz can improve the quantum sensitivity of axion interferometry by a factor of 15 compared to the quantum-enhanced heterodyne readout for 5-m long optical resonators. The proposed experimental method has the potential to be scaled up to kilometer-long facilities, enabling the detection or setting of constraints on the axion-photon coupling coefficient of 1E-17 - 1E-16 GeV-1 for axion masses ranging from 0.1 to 1 neV.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>Axion-Like Dark Matter Model Involving Two-Phase Structure and Two-Particle Composites (Dimers)</strong>, A. M. Gavrilik et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03290v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03290v1</a></p>

<p>Within the self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) model of dark matter (DM), we argue that the axion-like self-interaction of ultralight bosons ensures the existence of both rarefied and dense phases in the DM halo core of dwarf galaxies. In fact, this stems from two independent solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation corresponding to the same model parameters. For a small number of particles, this structure disappears, and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation reduces to stationary sine-Gordon equation, the one-dimensional anti-kink solution of which mimics a single-phase DM radial distribution in the halo core. Quantum mechanically, this solution corresponds to a zero-energy bound state of two particles in a closed scattering channel formed by the domain-wall potential with a finite asymptotics. To produce a two-particle composite with low positive energy and a finite lifetime, we appeal to the resonant transition of one asymptotically free particle of a pair from an open channel (with a model scattering potential) to the closed channel. Using the Feshbach resonance concept, the problem of two-channel quantum mechanics is solved in the presence of a small external influence which couples the two channels, and an analytical solution is obtained in the first approximation. Analyzing the dependence of scattering data on interaction parameters, we reveal a long-lived two-particle composite (dimer) state possessing a lifetime of millions of years. This result is rather surprising and supposes important implications of dimers’ being involved in forming large DM structures. It is shown that the dimers’ appearance is related with the regime of infinite scattering length due to resonance. The revealed dependence of the DM scattering length $a$ on the parameters of interactions can theoretically justify variation of $a$ in the DM dominated galaxies and its role for large DM structures.</p>

<p>Monoenergetic $\gamma$-ray spectral lines are among the cleanest signatures of dark matter annihilation. We analyze 15 years of Fermi-LAT data, find no spectral lines, and place strong constraints on dark matter annihilation to monoenergetic $\gamma$-rays. Additionally, we produce the first double-line analysis of the coupled signals from $\gamma\gamma$ and $Z \gamma$ lines, which proves particularly powerful for dark matter masses above $\sim150$~GeV. From our constraints on a double-line feature, we investigate and constrain some minimal models where the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) can be fit by dark matter annihilation through the Higgs boson into Standard Model particles.</p>

<p>The 3.5 keV line is a purported emission line observed in galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the Milky Way whose origin is inconsistent with known atomic transitions and has previously been suggested to arise from dark matter decay. We systematically re-examine the bulk of the evidence for the 3.5 keV line, attempting to reproduce six previous analyses that found evidence for the line. Surprisingly, we only reproduce one of the analyses; in the other five we find no significant evidence for a 3.5 keV line when following the described analysis procedures on the original data sets. For example, previous results claimed 4$\sigma$ evidence for a 3.5 keV line from the Perseus cluster; we dispute this claim, finding no evidence for a 3.5 keV line. We find evidence for background mismodeling in multiple analyses. We show that analyzing these data in narrower energy windows diminishes the effects of mismodeling but returns no evidence for a 3.5 keV line. We conclude that there is little robust evidence for the existence of the 3.5 keV line. Some of the discrepancy of our results from those of the original works may be due to the earlier reliance on local optimizers, which we demonstrate can lead to incorrect results. For ease of reproducibility, all code and data are publicly available.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>Is a recently discovered HI cloud near M94 a starless dark matter halo?</strong>, Alejandro Benitez-Llambay et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03253v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03253v1</a></p>

<p>Observations with the Five-Hundred-Meter Aperture Spherical Telescope have revealed the presence of a marginally-resolved source of 21 cm emission from a location $\sim50’$ from the M94 galaxy, without a stellar counterpart down to the surface brightness limit of the DESI Imaging Legacy Survey ($\sim29.15$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the $g$ band). The system (hereafter Cloud-9) has round column density isocontours and a line width consistent with thermal broadening from gas at $T\sim2\times10^4$ $K$. These properties are unlike those of previously detected dark HI clouds and similar to the expected properties of REionization-Limited-HI Cloud (RELHICs), namely, starless dark matter (DM) halos filled with gas in hydrostatic equilibrium and in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic ultraviolet background. At the distance of M94, $d\sim4.7$ Mpc, we find that Cloud-9 is consistent with being a RELHIC inhabiting a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM halo of mass, $M_{200}\sim5\times10^{9}$ $M_{\odot}$, and concentration, $c_{\rm NFW}\sim13$. Although the agreement between the model and observations is good, Cloud-9 appears to be slightly, but systematically, more extended than expected for $\Lambda$CDM RELHICs. This may imply either that Cloud-9 is much closer than implied by its recessional velocity, $v_{\rm CL9}\sim300$ km s$^{-1}$, or that its halo density profile is flatter than NFW, with a DM mass deficit greater than a factor of $10$ at radii $r\lesssim1$ kpc. Further observations may aid in constraining these scenarios better and help elucidate whether Cloud-9 is the first ever observed RELHIC, a cornerstone prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM model on the smallest scales.</p>

<p>Line-intensity mapping (LIM) surveys will characterise the cosmological large-scale structure of emissivity in a range of atomic and molecular spectral lines, but existing literature rarely considers whether these surveys can recover excitation properties of the tracer gas species, such as the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule. Combining basic empirical and physical assumptions with the off-the-shelf Radex radiative transfer code or a Gaussian process emulator of Radex outputs, we devise a basic dark matter halo model for CO emission by tying bulk CO properties to halo properties, exposing physical variables governing CO excitation as free parameters. The CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) is working towards a multi-band survey programme to observe both CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) at $z\sim7$. We show that this programme, as well as a further ‘Triple Deluxe’ extension to higher frequencies covering CO(3-2), is fundamentally capable of successfully recovering the connection between halo mass and CO abundances, and constraining the molecular gas kinetic temperature and density within the star-forming interstellar medium in ways that single-transition CO LIM cannot. Given a fiducial thermal pressure of $\sim10^4$ K cm$^{-3}$ for molecular gas in halos of $\sim10^{10}\,M_\odot$, simulated multi-band COMAP surveys successfully recover the thermal pressure within 68% interval half-widths of 0.5–0.6 dex. Construction of multi-frequency LIM instrumentation to access multiple CO transitions is crucial in harnessing this capability, as part of a cosmic statistical probe of gas metallicity, dust chemistry, and other physical parameters in star-forming regions of the first galaxies and proto-galaxies out of reionisation.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>A Bayesian estimation of the Milky Way’s circular velocity curve using Gaia DR3</strong>, Sven Põder et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02895v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.02895v1</a></p>

<p>Our goal is to calculate the circular velocity curve of the Milky Way, along with corresponding uncertainties that quantify various sources of systematic uncertainty in a self-consistent manner. The observed rotational velocities are described as circular velocities minus the asymmetric drift. The latter is described by the radial axisymmetric Jeans equation. We thus reconstruct the circular velocity curve between Galactocentric distances from 5 kpc to 14 kpc using a Bayesian inference approach. The estimated error bars quantify uncertainties in the Sun’s Galactocentric distance and the spatial-kinematic morphology of the tracer stars. As tracers, we used a sample of roughly 0.6 million stars on the red giant branch stars with six-dimensional phase-space coordinates from Gaia data release 3 (DR3). More than 99% of the sample is confined to a quarter of the stellar disc with mean radial, rotational, and vertical velocity dispersions of $(35\pm 18)\,\rm km/s$, $(25\pm 13)\,\rm km/s$, and $(19\pm 9)\,\rm km/s$, respectively. We find a circular velocity curve with a slope of $0.4\pm 0.6\,\rm km/s/kpc$, which is consistent with a flat curve within the uncertainties. We further estimate a circular velocity at the Sun’s position of $v_c(R_0)=233\pm7\, \rm km/s$ and that a region in the Sun’s vicinity, characterised by a physical length scale of $\sim 1\,\rm kpc$, moves with a bulk motion of $V_{LSR} =7\pm 7\,\rm km/s$. Finally, we estimate that the dark matter (DM) mass within 14 kpc is $\log_{10}M_{\rm DM}(R&lt;14\, {\rm kpc})/{\rm M_{\odot}}= \left(11.2^{+2.0}_{-2.3}\right)$ and the local spherically averaged DM density is $\rho_{\rm DM}(R_0)=\left(0.41^{+0.10}_{-0.09}\right)\,{\rm GeV/cm^3}=\left(0.011^{+0.003}_{-0.002}\right)\,{\rm M_\odot/pc^3}$. In addition, the effect of biased distance estimates on our results is assessed.</p>

<p>Dark matter particles captured in neutron stars deposit their energy as heat. This DM heating effect can be observed only if it dominates over other internal heating effects in NSs. In this work, as an example of such an internal heating source, we consider the frictional heating caused by the creep motion of neutron superfluid vortex lines in the NS crust. The luminosity of this heating effect is controlled by the strength of the interaction between the vortex lines and nuclei in the crust, which can be estimated from the many-body calculation of a high-density nuclear system as well as through the temperature observation of old NSs. We show that both the temperature observation and theoretical calculation suggest that the vortex creep heating dominates over the DM heating. The vortex-nuclei interaction must be smaller than the estimated values by several orders of magnitude to overturn this.</p>

<p>The physical collisions of two white dwarfs (WDs) (i.e. not slow mergers) have been shown to produce type-Ia-like supernovae (SNe) explosions. Most studies of WD-collisions have focused on zero impact-parameter (direct) collisions, which can also be studied in 2D. However, the vast majority of WD collisions arising from any evolutionary channels suggested to date, are expected to be indirect, i.e. have a non-negligible impact parameter upon collision. Here we use the highest resolution 3D simulations to date (making use of the AREPO code), in order to explore both direct and indirect collisions and the conditions in which they give rise to a detonation and the production of a luminous SNe. Using our simulations, we find a detonation criterion that can provide the critical impact parameter for an explosion to occur, depending on the density profile of the colliding WDs, their composition, and their collision velocities. We find that the initial velocity has a significant impact on the amount of 56Ni production from the explosion. Furthermore, the 56Ni production is also strongly dependent on the numerical resolution. While our results from the head-on collision with large initial velocities produce more 56Ni than previous simulations, those with small and comparable velocities produce significantly less 56Ni than previous works.</p>

<p>In November 2020, the Swift team announced a major update to the calibration of the UltraViolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) data to correct for the gradual loss of sensitivity over time. Beginning in roughly 2015, the correction affected observations in the three near ultraviolet (UV) filters, reaching levels of up to 0.3 mag immediately prior to the correction. Over the same time period, an increasing number of Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) were discovered and studied. Many SLSNe-I are hot (T$_\textrm{eff}$ $\approx 10,000$ K) near peak, and therefore accurate UV data are imperative towards properly understanding their physical properties and energetics. We re-compute Swift UVOT photometry for SLSNe-I discovered between 2014 and 2021 with at least 5 Swift observations in 2015 or later. We calculate host-subtracted magnitudes for each SLSN and fit their spectral energy distributions with modified blackbodies to obtain the radius and temperature evolution. We also fit multi-band photometry using the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients (MOSFiT) to obtain key parameters such as the spin period (P), magnetic field strength (B), ejecta mass (M$_\textrm{ej}$), and kinetic energy (E$_\textrm{kin}$). From our MOSFiT modeling, we also estimate the peak UV/optical luminosity (L$_\textrm{peak}$) and total radiative energy (E$_\textrm{rad}$). Under the assumption of magnetar-powered SLSNe we find several strong trends, including anti-correlations between P and both L$_\textrm{peak}$ and E$_\textrm{rad}$, a correlation between E$_\textrm{kin}$ and E$_\textrm{rad}$, and an anti-correlation between B and E$_\textrm{rad}$.</p>

<p>The SPT-3G 2018 TT/TE/EE cosmic microwave background (CMB) data set (temperature and polarization) is used to place constraints on an axion-like model of early dark energy (EDE). These data do not favor axion-like EDE and place an upper limit on the maximum fraction of the total energy density $f_{\rm EDE}&lt; 0.172$ (at the 95% confidence level, CL). This is in contrast with ACT DR4 which gives $f_{\rm EDE}=0.150^{+0.050}_{-0.078}$. When combining CMB measurements with measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillations and luminosity distance to Type Ia supernovae, we show that the tension with the S$H_0$ES measurement of the Hubble parameter goes up from 2.6$\sigma$ with Planck to 2.9$\sigma$ with Planck+SPT-3G 2018. The additional inclusion of ACT DR4 data leads to a reduction of the tension to $1.6\sigma$, but the discrepancy between ACT DR4 and Planck+SPT-3G 2018 casts some doubt on the statistical consistency of this joint analysis. The importance of improved measurements of the CMB at both intermediate and small scales (in particular the shape of the damping tail) as well as the interplay between temperature and polarization measurements in constraining EDE are discussed. Upcoming ground-based measurements of the CMB will play a crucial role in determining whether EDE remains a viable model to address the Hubble tension.</p>

<p>Milky Way Cepheid variables with accurate {\it Hubble Space Telescope} photometry have been established as standards for primary calibration of the cosmic distance ladder to achieve a percent-level determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$). These 75 Cepheid standards are the fundamental sample for investigation of possible residual systematics in the local $H_0$ determination due to metallicity effects on their period-luminosity relations. We obtained new high-resolution ($R\sim81,000$), high signal-to-noise ($S/N\sim50-150$) multi-epoch spectra of 42 out of 75 Cepheid standards using ESPaDOnS instrument at the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Our spectroscopic metallicity measurements are in good agreement with the literature values with systematic differences up to $0.1$ dex due to different metallicity scales. We homogenized and updated the spectroscopic metallicities of all 75 Milky Way Cepheid standards and derived their multiwavelength ($GVIJHK_s$) period-luminosity-metallicity and period-Wesenheit-metallicity relations using the latest {\it Gaia} parallaxes. The metallicity coefficients of these empirically calibrated relations exhibit large uncertainties due to low statistics and a narrow metallicity range ($\Delta\textrm{[Fe/H]}=0.6$~dex). These metallicity coefficients are up to three times better constrained if we include Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud and range between $-0.21\pm0.07$ and $-0.43\pm0.06$ mag/dex. The updated spectroscopic metallicities of these Milky Way Cepheid standards were used in the Cepheid-Supernovae distance ladder formalism to determine $H_0=72.9~\pm 1.0$\textrm{~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$}, suggesting little variation ($\sim 0.1$ ~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$) in the local $H_0$ measurements due to different Cepheid metallicity scales.</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>Prevalence of Compact Nuclear Radio Emission in Post-Merger Galaxies and its Origin</strong>, Gregory Walsh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03252v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.03252v1</a></p>

<p>Post-merger galaxies are unique laboratories to study the triggering and interplay of star-formation and AGN activity. Combining new, high resolution, 10 GHz Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations with archival radio surveys, we have examined the radio properties of 28 spheroidal post-merger galaxies. We find a general lack of extended emission at (sub-)kiloparsec scales, indicating the prevalence of compact, nuclear radio emission in these post-merger galaxies, with the majority (16/18; 89\%) being radio-quiet at 10 GHz. Using multi-wavelength data, we determine the origin of the radio emission, discovering 14 new radio AGN and 4 post-mergers dominated by emission from a population of supernova remnants. Among the radio AGN, almost all are radio-quiet (12/14; 86\%). We discover a new dual AGN (DAGN) candidate, J1511+0417, and investigate the radio properties of the DAGN candidate J0843+3549. 4 of these radio AGN are hosted by SF emission-line galaxies, suggesting that radio AGN activity may be present during periods of SF activity in post-mergers. The low jet powers and compact morphologies of these radio AGN also point to a scenario in which AGN feedback may be efficient in this sample of post-mergers. Lastly, we present simulated, multi-frequency observations of the 14 radio AGN with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and the VLBI capabilities of the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) to assess the feasibility of these instruments in searches for supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs).</p>

<p>2023-09-06, <strong>Impact of dark energy on the equation of state in light of the latest cosmological data</strong>, N. Myrzakulov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02931v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.02931v1</a></p>

<p>We reconstruct the effective Equation of State (EoS) within the framework of General Relativity (GR) theory in a homogeneous and isotropic FLRW Universe, which is assumed to be composed of matter and Dark Energy (DE). Our analysis employs a dataset consisting of 31 Cosmic Chronometer (CC) data points, six data points of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and 1048 Type Ia Supernovae (SN) from the Pantheon sample, and we determine the best-fit values of the model parameters through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. We then use these parameter values to calculate various cosmological parameters, such as the DE EoS parameter, the energy density, the deceleration parameter, the state finder parameters, and the $Om(z)$ diagnostic. All the analyzed cosmological parameters show behavior consistent with the accelerated Universe scenario.</p>
