<p>2023-09-18, <strong>Analysis of $b\rightarrow cτ\barν_τ$ anomalies using weak effective Hamiltonian with complex couplings</strong>, Muhammad Arslan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09929v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09929v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, the experimental measurements of the branching ratios and different polarization asymmetries for the processes occurring through flavor-changing-charged current b\rightarrow c\tau\overline{\nu}_{\tau} transitions by BABAR, Belle, and LHCb show some sparkling differences with the corresponding SM predictions. Assuming the left handed neutrinos, we add the dimension-six vector, (pseudo-)scalar, and tensor operators with complex WCs to the SM WEH. Together with 60%, 30% and 10% constraints coming from the branching ratio of B_{c}\to\tau\bar{\nu}_{\tau}, we analyze the parametric space of these new physics WCs accommodating the current anomalies in the purview of the most recent HFLAV data of R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D\right), R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^<em>\right) and Belle data of F_{L}\left(D^</em>\right) and P_{\tau}\left(D^<em>\right). Furthermore, we derive the sum rules which correlate these observables with R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D\right) and R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^</em>\right). Using the best-fit points of the new complex WCs along with the latest measurements of R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^{(*)}\right), we predict the numerical values of the observable R_{\tau/\ell}\left(\Lambda_c\right), R_{\tau/\mu}\left(J/\psi\right) and R_{\tau/\ell}\left(X_c\right) from the sum rules. Apart from finding the correlation matrix among the observables under consideration, we plot them graphically which is useful to discriminate different NP scenarios. Finally, we study the impact of these NP couplings on various angular and the CP triple product asymmetries, that could be measured in some ongoing and future experiments. The precise measurements of these observables are important to check the SM and extract the possible NP.</p>

<p>2023-09-18, <strong>Detecting High-Energy Neutrinos from Galactic Supernovae with ATLAS</strong>, Alex Y. Wen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09771v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09771v1</a></p>

<p>We show that ATLAS, a collider detector, can measure the flux of high-energy supernova neutrinos, which can be produced from days to months after the explosion. Using Monte Carlo simulations for predicted fluxes, we find at most $\mathcal{O}(0.1-1)$ starting events and $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ throughgoing events from a supernova 10 kpc away. Possible Galactic supernovae from Betelgeuse and Eta Carinae are further analyzed as demonstrative examples. We argue that even with limited statistics, ATLAS has the ability to discriminate among flavors and between neutrinos and antineutrinos, making it an unique neutrino observatory so far unmatched in this capability.</p>

<p>2023-09-18, <strong>Calibrating baryonic feedback with weak lensing and fast radio bursts</strong>, Robert Reischke et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09766v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09766v1</a></p>

<p>One of the key limitations of large-scale structure surveys of the current and future generation, such as Euclid, LSST-Rubin or Roman, is the influence of feedback processes on the distribution of matter in the Universe. This effect, called baryonic feedback, modifies the matter power spectrum on non-linear scales much stronger than any cosmological parameter of interest. Constraining these modifications is therefore key to unlock the full potential of the upcoming surveys, and we propose to do so with the help of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). FRBs are short, astrophysical radio transients of extragalactic origin. Their burst signal is dispersed by the free electrons in the large-scale-structure, leading to delayed arrival times at different frequencies characterised by the dispersion measure (DM). Since the dispersion measure is sensitive to the integrated line-of-sight electron density, it is a direct probe of the baryonic content of the Universe. We investigate how FRBs can break the degeneracies between cosmological and feedback parameters by correlating the observed Dispersion Measure with the weak gravitational lensing signal of a Euclid-like survey. In particular we use a simple one-parameter model controlling baryonic feedback, but we expect similar findings for more complex models. Within this model we find that $\sim 10^4$ FRBs are sufficient to constrain the baryonic feedback 10 times better than cosmic shear alone. Breaking this degeneracy will tighten the constraints considerably, for example we expect a factor of two improvement on the sum of neutrino masses</p>

<p>2023-09-18, <strong>Monstrous Higgs and Leech Spacetime</strong>, Seyed M. F. Khaki et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09762v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09762v1</a></p>

<p>Initial results of studying the de Sitter space dual to the Monster CFT are announced. It is reported that the boson of the underlying scalar field in the ground state of the untwisted sector is precisely as heavy as the Higgs boson and the vacuum energy of the twisted sector coincides with the Cosmological constant. Further, the Planck mass and the GUT scale are calculated almost exactly, all in a simple framework of the finite fields. In light of these and other observations, it is proposed that the origin of mass is very likely the sporadic groups and the fabric of spacetime is most probably the Leech lattice. The proposed model predicts a globally flat and locally 3D de Sitter space (globally 3D and locally 4D spacetime) as well as two origins of mass, one for the Higgs boson and one for the neutrinos.</p>

<p>2023-09-18, <strong>The LHC as a Neutrino-Ion Collider</strong>, Juan M. Cruz-Martinez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09581v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09581v1</a></p>

<p>Proton-proton collisions at the LHC generate a high-intensity collimated beam of neutrinos in the forward (beam) direction, characterised by energies of up to several TeV. The recent observation of LHC neutrinos by FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC signals that this hitherto ignored particle beam is now available for scientific inquiry. Here we quantify the impact that neutrino deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) measurements at the LHC would have on the parton distributions (PDFs) of protons and heavy nuclei. We generate projections for DIS structure functions for FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC at Run III, as well as for the FASER$\nu$2, AdvSND, and FLArE experiments to be hosted at the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF) operating concurrently with the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). We determine that up to one million electron- and muon-neutrino DIS interactions within detector acceptance can be expected by the end of the HL-LHC, covering a kinematic region in $x$ and $Q^2$ overlapping with that of the Electron-Ion Collider. Including these DIS projections into global (n)PDF analyses, specifically PDF4LHC21, NNPDF4.0, and EPPS21, reveals a significant reduction of PDF uncertainties, in particular for strangeness and the up and down valence PDFs. We show that LHC neutrino data enables improved theoretical predictions for core processes at the HL-LHC, such as Higgs and weak gauge boson production. Our analysis demonstrates that exploiting the LHC neutrino beam effectively provides CERN with a “Neutrino-Ion Collider” without requiring modifications in its accelerator infrastructure.</p>

<p>2023-09-17, <strong>Constraining baryon loading efficiency of AGNs with diffuse neutrino flux from galaxy clusters</strong>, Xin-Yue Shi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09244v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09244v1</a></p>

<p>The active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are widely believed to be one of the promising acceleration sites of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (CRs). Essentially, AGNs are powered by the gravitational energy of matter falling to supermassive black holes. However, the conversion efficiency of gravitational to kinetic energy of CRs in AGNs, which is defined as baryon loading factor $\eta_p$, is not well known yet. After being accelerated, high-energy CRs could escape the host galaxy and enter the intra-cluster medium (ICM). These CRs can be confined within the galaxy cluster and produce $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos through proton-proton collisions with the ICM. In this paper, we study the diffusion of CRs in galaxy clusters and calculate the diffuse neutrino flux from galaxy cluster population. Using the latest upper limits on the cumulative unresolved TeV-PeV neutrino flux from galaxy clusters posed by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we derive the upper limit of the average baryon loading factor as $\eta_{p,\mathrm{grav}} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-3} - 0.1$ for the population of galaxy clusters. This constraint is more stringent than the one obtained from $\gamma$-ray observation on the Coma cluster.</p>

<p>2023-09-17, <strong>Energy-dependent flavour ratios in neutrino telescopes from charm</strong>, Atri Bhattacharya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09139v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09139v1</a></p>

<p>The origin of the observed diffuse neutrino flux is not yet known. Studies of the relative flavour content of the neutrino flux detected at Earth can give information on the production mechanisms at the sources and on flavour mixing, complementary to measurements of the spectral index and normalisation. Here we demonstrate the effects of neutrino fluxes with different spectral shapes and different initial flavour compositions dominating at different energies, and we study the sensitivity of future measurements with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Where one kind of flux gives way to another, this shows up as a non-trivial energy dependence in the flavour compositions. We explore this in the context of slow-jet supernovae and magnetar-driven supernovae – two examples of astrophysical sources where charm production may be effective. Using current best-fit neutrino mixing parameters and their projected 2040 uncertainties, we use event ratios of different event morphologies at IceCube to illustrate the possibilities of distinguishing the energy dependence of neutrino flavour ratios.</p>

<p>2023-09-18, <strong>Gravitational Wave Resonance in Ultra-Light Dark Matter Halos</strong>, Paola C. M. Delgado et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09946v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09946v1</a></p>

<p>Ultra-Light Dark Matter (ULDM) halos constituted by Ultra-Light Axions (ULAs) generate gravitational potentials that oscillate in time. In this paper I show these potentials interact with gravitational waves, resonantly amplifying them. For all ULA masses considered, the resonance in the solar region is currently negligible, while in a denser dark matter environment, which may arise due to different phenomena, it might become significant. The frequency of the amplified gravitational wave is equal to the ULA mass in the case of first resonance band, which represents the most efficient scenario.</p>

<p>2023-09-18, <strong>CMB constraints on inflection-point inflation with a pseudo-scalar dark matter</strong>, Jamerson G. Rodrigues et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09842v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09842v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we investigate the physical aspects of the inflection-point inflation scenario and assess its observational viability in light of current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. The model we consider encapsulates the inflaton with a pseudo-scalar (the dark matter candidate) in a complex neutral scalar singlet. The cosmological constraints on the parameters of inflation derived at a high energy scale are translated to a low energy scale by running these parameters. Ensuring the entire Lagrangian to be invariant under a $Z_3$ symmetry with the adequate transformation of the fields, the imaginary part of the singlet decouples from the other scalars of the model. We then investigate if the observational viability of inflation is also compatible with this pseudo-scalar being the dark matter component. We show that the CMB constraints on the inflationary parameters assure that the pseudo-scalar is stable and provides the correct relic dark matter abundance, regardless of whether it is thermally or non-thermally produced.</p>

<p>2023-09-18, <strong>Probing Light DM through Migdal Effect with Spherical Proportional Counter</strong>, Yuchao Gu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09740v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09740v1</a></p>

<p>Owing to its low electronic noise and flexible target materials, the Spherical Proportional Counter (SPC) with a single electron detection threshold can be utilized to search for sub-GeV dark matter (DM). In this work, we investigate the prospects for light DM direct detection through the DM-nucleus Migdal effect in the DARKSPHERE detector. We consider the different DM velocity distributions and momentum-transfer effects. For Xenon and Neon targets, we find that the DM mass $m_{DM}$ can be probed down to as low as $m_{DM} \sim \mathcal{O}$(10) MeV, and the derived bounds on the DM-nucleus scattering cross section $\bar{\sigma}_{n}$ are sensitive to the high-velocity tails of the DM velocity distribution, which can be altered by orders of magnitude for the different DM velocity distributions in the region $m_{DM} &lt; 10$ MeV.</p>

<p>2023-09-18, <strong>TeV gamma-ray sensitivity to velocity-dependent dark matter models in the Galactic Center</strong>, Alessandro Montanari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09691v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09691v1</a></p>

<p>The center of the Milky Way is a prime site to search for signals of dark matter (DM) annihilation due to its proximity and expected high concentration of DM. The amplification of the dispersion velocity of DM particles in the Galactic center (GC), caused by baryonic contraction and feedback, makes this particular region of the sky an even more promising target for exploring velocity-dependent DM models. Here we demonstrate that current GC observations with the H.E.S.S. telescope, presently the most sensitive TeV-scale gamma-ray telescope in operation in this region of the sky, set the strongest constraints on velocity-dependent annihilating DM particles with masses above 200 GeV. For p-wave annihilations, they improve the current constraints by a factor of $\sim$4 for a DM mass of 1 TeV. For the spatial distribution of DM, we use the results of the latest FIRE-2 zoom cosmological simulation of Milky Way-size halos. In addition, we utilize the newest version of the GALPROP cosmic-ray propagation framework to simulate the Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission in the GC. We have found that p-wave (d-wave) DM particles with a mass of approximately 1.7 TeV and annihilating into the $W^+$$W^-$ channel exhibit a velocity-weighted annihilation cross-section upper limit of 4.6$\times$ 10$^{-22}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$ (9.2$\times$10$^{-17}$ cm$^3$s$^{- 1}$) at a 95\% confidence level. This is about 460 (2$\times$ 10$^{6}$) times greater than the thermal relic cross-section for p-wave (d-wave) DM models.</p>

<p>2023-09-18, <strong>Dark matter searches in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the Cherenkov Telescope Array</strong>, Francesco Gabriele Saturni et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09607v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09607v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter (DM) is one of the major components in the Universe. However, at present its existence is still only inferred through indirect astronomical observations. DM particles can annihilate or decay, producing final-state Standard Model pairs that subsequently annihilate into high-energy $\gamma$-rays. The dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) in the Milky Way DM halo have long been considered optimal targets to search for annihilating DM signatures in GeV-to-TeV $\gamma$-ray spectra due to their high DM densities (hence high astrophysical factors), as well as the expected absence of intrinsic $\gamma$-ray emission of astrophysical origin. For such targets, it is important to compute the amount of DM in their halos in a consistent way to optimize the $\gamma$-ray data analysis. Such estimates directly affect the observability of DM signals in dSphs, as well as the DM constraints that can be derived in case of null detection. In this contribution, we present the results on the sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) for DM annihilation and decay searches using planned observations of the Milky Way dSphs. We select the most promising targets among all presently known dwarf satellites, providing new determinations of their expected DM signal. This study shows an improvement of approximately an order of magnitude in sensitivity compared to current searches in similar targets. We also discuss the results in terms of cuspy and cored DM models, and investigate the sensitivity obtained by the combination of observations from different dSphs. Finally, we explore the optimal strategies for CTA observations of dSphs.</p>

<p>2023-09-18, <strong>Clock Transitions Versus Bragg Diffraction in Atom-interferometric Dark-matter Detection</strong>, Daniel Derr et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09538v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09538v1</a></p>

<p>Atom interferometers with long baselines are envisioned to complement the ongoing search for dark matter. They rely on atomic manipulation based on internal (clock) transitions or state-preserving atomic diffraction. Principally, dark matter can act on the internal as well as the external degrees of freedom to both of which atom interferometers are susceptible. We therefore study in this contribution the effects of dark matter on the internal atomic structure and the atoms’ motion. In particular, we show that the atomic transition frequency depends on the mean coupling and the differential coupling of the involved states to dark matter, scaling with the unperturbed atomic transition frequency and the Compton frequency, respectively. The differential coupling is only of relevance when internal states change, which makes detectors, e.g., based on single-photon transitions sensitive to both coupling parameters. For sensors generated by state-preserving diffraction mechanisms like Bragg diffraction, the mean coupling modifies only the motion of the atom as the dominant contribution. Finally, we compare both effects observed in terrestrial dark-matter detectors.</p>

<p>2023-09-17, <strong>Probing invisible vector meson decay mode with hadronic beam in the NA64 experiment at SPS/CERN</strong>, Alexey S. Zhevlakov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09347v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09347v1</a></p>

<p>We test a novel idea of using a $\pi^-$ beam in the fixed-target experiments to search for New Physics in the events with missing energy. Bounds for invisible vector $\rho$ meson decay were derived, analyzed, and compared with the current limits on searching Dark Matter in the accelerator based experiments. We demonstrate that the new approach can be effective tool to probe sub-GeV Dark Matter parameter space.</p>

<p>2023-09-17, <strong>The $U(1)_{L_μ-L_τ}$ breaking phase transition, muon $g-2$, dark matter, collider and gravitational wave</strong>, Jie Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09210v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09210v1</a></p>

<p>Combining the dark matter and muon $g-2$ anomaly, we study the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ breaking phase transition, gravitational wave spectra, and the direct detection at the LHC in an extra $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge symmetry extension of the standard model. The new fields includes vector-like leptons ($E_1,~ E_2,~ N$), $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ breaking scalar $S$ and gauge boson $Z’$, as well as the dark matter candidate $X_I$ and its heavy partner $X_R$. A joint explanation of the dark matter relic density and muon $g-2$ anomaly excludes the region where both $min(m_{E_1},m_{E_2},m_N,m_{X_R})$ and $min(m_{Z’},m_S)$ are much larger than $m_{X_I}$. In the parameter space accommodating the DM relic density and muon $g-2$ anomaly, the model can achieve a first order $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ breaking phase transition, whose strength is sensitive to the parameters of Higgs potential. The corresponding gravitational wave spectra can reach the sensitivity of U-DECIGO. In addition, the direct searches at the LHC impose stringent bound on the mass spectra of the vector-like leptons and dark matter.</p>

<p>In the present work, we study the possible production of the heavy neutral dark gauge boson (A$^{\prime}$) candidates, which are originated from a simplified model based on the Einstein-Cartan gravity, in association with dark matter. This study has been performed by studying events with dimuon plus missing transverse energy produced in the simulated proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, at 13.6 TeV center of mass energy and integrated luminosity of 52 fb$^{-1}$ corresponding to the LHC RUN III circumstances. These provide the most stringent upper limits on the masses for various particles in the model as, spin-1 (A$^{\prime}$), as well as the heavy mediator (torsion field).</p>

<p>We propose to use the nuclear spin excitation in the ferromagnetic A1 phase of the superfluid $^3$He for the axion dark matter detection. This approach is striking in that it is sensitive to the axion-nucleon coupling, one of the most important features of the QCD axion introduced to solve the strong CP problem. We review a quantum mechanical description of the nuclear spin excitation and apply it to the estimation of the axion-induced spin excitation rate. We also describe a possible detection method of the spin excitation in detail and show that the combination of the squeezing of the final state with the Josephson parametric amplifier and the homodyne measurement can enhance the sensitivity. It turns out that this approach gives good sensitivity to the axion dark matter with the mass of $O(1) \, \mu \mathrm{eV}$ depending on the size of the external magnetic field. We estimate the parameters of experimental setups, e.g., the detector volume and the amplitude of squeezing, required to reach the QCD axion parameter space.</p>

<p>We investigate a flat Emergent Universe (EU) with a nonlinear equation of state which is equivalent to three different compositions of fluids. In the EU, initially, the evolution of the universe began with no interaction, but as time evolves, an interaction sets in among the three fluids leading to the observed universe. The characteristic of an EU is that it is a singularity-free universe that evolves with all the basic features of the early evolution. A given nonlinear equation of state parameter permits a universe with three different fluids. We get a universe with dark energy, cosmic string, and radiation domination to begin with, which at a later epoch transits into a universe with three different fluids with matter domination, dark matter, and dark energy for a given interaction strength among the cosmic fluids. Later the model parameters are constrained using the observed Hubble data and Type Ia Supernova (SnIa) data from the Pantheon data set. The classical stability analysis of the model is performed using the square speed of sound. It is found that a theoretically stable cosmological model can be obtained in this case, however, the model becomes classically unstable at the present epoch when the observational bounds on the model parameters are taken into account.</p>

<p>We investigate the relic abundance of asymmetric Dark Matter in the non-standard cosmological scenarios when the annihilation cross section includes the self annihilation. Here we discuss the kination model and brane world cosmology. When the self annihilation is permitted for asymmetric dark matter, there is possibility of washing out the pre-existed asymmetry. We find the constraints on the cross section to avoid the complete washing out of the asymmetry in the non-standard cosmological scenarios. The enhanced cosmic expansion rate causes the freeze out point of wash-out to be earlier. The larger self annihilation cross sections are allowed to exist in kination model and brane world cosmology.</p>

<p>2023-09-18, <strong>SN 2022crv: IIb, Or Not IIb: That is the Question</strong>, Yize Dong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09433v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09433v1</a></p>

<p>We present optical and near-infrared observations of SN~2022crv, a stripped envelope supernova in NGC~3054, discovered within 12 hrs of explosion by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc Survey. We suggest SN~2022crv is a transitional object on the continuum between SNe Ib and SNe IIb. A high-velocity hydrogen feature ($\sim$$-$20,000 – $-$16,000 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$) was conspicuous in SN~2022crv at early phases, and then quickly disappeared around maximum light. By comparing with hydrodynamic modeling, we find that a hydrogen envelope of $\sim 10^{-3}$ \msun{} can reproduce the behaviour of the hydrogen feature observed in SN~2022crv. The early light curve of SN~2022crv did not show envelope cooling emission, implying that SN~2022crv had a compact progenitor with extremely low amount of hydrogen. The analysis of the nebular spectra shows that SN~2022crv is consistent with the explosion of a He star with a final mass of $\sim$4.5 – 5.6 \msun{} that has evolved from a $\sim$16 – 22 \msun{} zero-age main sequence star in a binary system with about 1.0 – 1.7 \msun{} of oxygen finally synthesized in the core. The high metallicity at the supernova site indicates that the progenitor experienced a strong stellar wind mass loss. In order to retain a small amount of residual hydrogen at such a high metallicity, the initial orbital separation of the binary system is likely larger than $\sim$1000~$\rm R_{\odot}$. The near-infrared spectra of SN~2022crv show a unique absorption feature on the blue side of He I line at $\sim$1.005~$\mu$m. This is the first time that such a feature has been observed in a Type Ib/IIb, and could be due to \ion{Sr}{2}. Further detailed modelling on SN~2022crv can shed light on the progenitor and the origin of the mysterious absorption feature in the near infrared.</p>

<p>We present a data-driven model for abundances of Fe, Sr, Ba, and Eu in metal-poor (MP) stars. The production patterns for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs) are derived from the data of Holmbeck et al. (arXiv:2007.00749) on [Sr/Fe], [Ba/Fe], and [Eu/Fe] for 195 stars. Nearly all the data can be accounted for by mixtures of contributions from these two sources. We find that on average, the Sr contribution to an MP star from BNSMs is $\approx 3$ times that from CCSNe. Our model is also consistent with the solar inventory of Fe, Sr, Ba, and Eu. We carry out a parametric $r$-process study to explore the conditions that can give rise to our inferred production patterns and find that such conditions are largely consistent with those from simulations of CCSNe and BNSMs. Our model can be greatly enhanced by accurate abundances of many $r$-process elements in a large number of MP stars, and future results from this approach can be used to probe the conditions in CCSNe and BNSMs in much more detail.</p>

<p>2023-09-17, <strong>Pulsational pair-instability supernovae in gravitational-wave and electromagnetic transients</strong>, D. D. Hendriks et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09339v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09339v1</a></p>

<p>Current observations of binary black-hole ({BBH}) merger events show support for a feature in the primary BH-mass distribution at $\sim\,35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, previously interpreted as a signature of pulsational pair-instability (PPISN) supernovae. Such supernovae are expected to map a wide range of pre-supernova carbon-oxygen (CO) core masses to a narrow range of BH masses, producing a peak in the BH mass distribution. However, recent numerical simulations place the mass location of this peak above $50\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Motivated by uncertainties in the progenitor’s evolution and explosion mechanism, we explore how modifying the distribution of BH masses resulting from PPISN affects the populations of gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) transients. To this end, we simulate populations of isolated {BBH} systems and combine them with cosmic star-formation rates. Our results are the first cosmological BBH-merger predictions made using the \textsc{binary\_c} rapid population synthesis framework. We find that our fiducial model does not match the observed GW peak. We can only explain the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak with PPISNe by shifting the expected CO core-mass range for PPISN downwards by $\sim{}15\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Apart from being in tension with state-of-the art stellar models, we also find that this is likely in tension with the observed rate of hydrogen-less super-luminous supernovae. Conversely, shifting the mass range upward, based on recent stellar models, leads to a predicted third peak in the BH mass function at $\sim{}64\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Thus we conclude that the $\sim{}35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ feature is unlikely to be related to PPISNe.</p>

<p>2023-09-17, <strong>Global properties of nuclei at finite-temperature within the covariant energy density functional theory</strong>, Ante Ravlić et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09302v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09302v1</a></p>

<p>In stellar environments nuclei appear at finite temperatures, becoming extremely hot in core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. However, due to theoretical and computational complexity, most model calculations of nuclear properties are performed at zero temperature, while those existing at finite temperatures are limited only to selected regions of the nuclide chart. In this study we perform the global calculation of nuclear properties for even-even $8 \leq Z \leq 104$ nuclei at temperatures in range $0\le T \le 2$ MeV. Calculations are based on the finite temperature relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov model supplemented by the Bonche-Levit-Vautherin vapor subtraction procedure. We find that near the neutron-drip line the continuum states have significant contribution already at moderate temperature $T\approx 1$ MeV, thus emphasising the necessity of the vapor subtraction procedure. Results include neutron emission lifetimes, quadrupole deformations, neutron skin thickness, proton and neutron pairing gaps, entropy and excitation energy. Up to the temperature $T\approx 1$ MeV nuclear landscape is influenced only moderately by the finite-temperature effects, mainly by reducing the pairing correlations. As the temperature increases further, the effects on nuclear structures become pronounced, reducing both the deformations and the shell effects.</p>

<p>This study explores the cosmological implications of the $F(R, T)$ quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory, a modification of the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity theory. Our analysis focuses on the self-accelerating solution of the background equations of motion, which are shown to exist in the theory. Notably, we find that the theory features an effective cosmological constant, which has important implications for our understanding of the universe’s accelerated expansion. To test the viability of the $F(R, T)$ quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory, we utilize the Union2 Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) dataset, comprising 557 observations. Our results demonstrate that the theory is capable of explaining the accelerated expansion of the universe without requiring the presence of dark energy. This finding supports the potential of the $F(R, T)$ quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory as an alternative explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration. Moreover, we investigate the properties of tensor perturbations within the framework of this theory and derive a novel expression for the dispersion relation of gravitational waves. Our analysis reveals interesting features of the modified dispersion relation in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology, providing new insights into the nature of gravitational waves in the contest of the $F(R, T)$ quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory.</p>

<p>2023-09-17, <strong>SN 2022vqz: A Peculiar SN 2002es-like Type Ia Supernova with Prominent Early Excess Emission</strong>, Gaobo Xi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09213v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09213v1</a></p>

<p>We present extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of a peculiar type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2022vqz. It shares many similarities with the SN 2002es-like SNe Ia, such as low luminosity (i.e., $M_{B,\rm max}=-18.11\pm0.16$ mag) and moderate post-peak decline rate (i.e., $\Delta m_{15,B}=1.33\pm0.11$ mag). The nickel mass synthesized in the explosion is estimated as $0.20\pm0.04~{\rm M}_\odot$ from the bolometric light curve, which is obviously lower than normal SNe Ia. SN 2022vqz is also characterized by a slow expanding ejecta, with Si II velocities persisting around 7000 km s$^{-1}$ since 16 days before the peak, which is unique among all known SNe Ia. While all these properties imply a less energetic thermonuclear explosion that should leave considerable amount of unburnt materials, however, absent signature of unburnt carbon in the spectra of SN 2022vqz is puzzling. A prominent early peak is clearly detected in the $c$- and $o$-band light curves of ATLAS and in the $gr$-band data of ZTF within days after the explosion. Possible mechanisms for the early peak are discussed, including sub-Chandrasekhar mass double detonation model and interaction of SN ejecta with circumstellar material (CSM). We found both models face some difficulties in replicating all aspects of the observed data. As an alternative, we propose a hybrid CONe white dwarf as progenitor of SN 2022vqz which can simultaneously reconcile the tension between low ejecta velocity and absence of carbon. We further discuss the diversity of 02es-like objects and possible origins of different scenarios.</p>

<p>2023-09-17, <strong>A Hierarchical Framework for explaining the Cosmic Ray Spectrum using Diffusive Shock Acceleration</strong>, Roger Blandford et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09116v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.09116v1</a></p>

<p>The hypothesis that the entire cosmic ray spectrum, from $\lesssim1\,{\rm GeV}$ to $\gtrsim100\,{\rm EeV}$ energy, can be accounted for by diffusive shock acceleration on increasingly large scales is critically examined. Specifically, it is conjectured that Galactic cosmic rays, up to $\sim3\,{\rm PeV}$, are mostly produced by local supernova remnants, from which they escape upstream. These cosmic rays initiate a powerful magnetocentrifugal wind, removing disk mass and angular momentum before passing through the Galactic Wind Termination Shock at a radius $\sim200\,{\rm kpc}$, where they can be re-accelerated to account for observed cosmic rays up to $\sim30\,{\rm PeV}$. The cosmic rays transmitted downstream from more powerful termination shocks associated with other galaxies can be further accelerated at Intergalactic Accretion Shocks to the highest energies observed. In this interpretation, the highest rigidity observed particles are protons; the highest energy particles are heavy nuclei, such as iron. A universal “bootstrap” prescription, coupling the energy density of the magnetic turbulence to that of the resonant cosmic rays, is proposed, initially for the highest energy particles escaping far ahead of the shock front and then scattering, successively, lower energy particles downstream. Observable implications of this general scheme relate to the spectrum, composition and sky distribution of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays, the extragalactic radio background, the Galactic halo magnetic field and Pevatrons.</p>
