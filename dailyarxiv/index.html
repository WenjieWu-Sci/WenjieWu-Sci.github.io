<p>2025-05-22, <strong>Predicting the outcome of collisional neutrino flavor conversion</strong>, Julien Froustey et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16961v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.16961v1</a></p>

<p>Collisional flavor instabilities, driven by differing neutrino and antineutrino reaction rates, are expected to occur in dense astrophysical environments like supernovae and neutron star mergers, but have yet to be incorporated in large-scale simulations. We derive, for the first time, analytical expressions for the asymptotic state resulting from a homogeneous and isotropic instability, and apply these predictions to two representative conditions from a neutron star merger simulation. We emphasize the importance of using a collision term that allows for both damping of flavor coherence and relaxation back to thermal equilibrium, which leads to a “quantum” equilibrium with nonzero coherence. These results can be implemented in a subgrid model of collisional flavor transformation, an important step toward the inclusion of flavor oscillation physics into global simulations.</p>

<p>IceCube is a Cherenkov detector instrumenting over a cubic kilometer of glacial ice deep under the surface of the South Pole. The DeepCore sub-detector lowers the detection energy threshold to a few GeV, enabling the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters with atmospheric neutrinos. The reconstruction of neutrino interactions inside the detector is essential in studying neutrino oscillations. It is particularly challenging to reconstruct sub-100 GeV events with the IceCube detectors due to the relatively sparse detection units and detection medium. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are broadly used in physics experiments for both classification and regression purposes. This paper discusses the CNNs developed and employed for the latest IceCube-DeepCore oscillation measurements. These CNNs estimate various properties of the detected neutrinos, such as their energy, direction of arrival, interaction vertex position, flavor-related signature, and are also used for background classification.</p>

<p>2025-05-22, <strong>Neutrino Decoherence via Modified Dispersion</strong>, Bikash Kumar Acharya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16699v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.16699v1</a></p>

<p>We study in detail the effect of quantum decoherence in neutrino oscillations. We adopt a phenomenological approach that allows us to parametrize the energy dependence of the decoherence effects resulting from the modification of the neutrino dispersion relation. Using the open quantum system framework we derive decoherence parameters, which are usually connected to quantum gravitational effects. Furthermore, we study the sensitivity of decoherence on high-energy astrophysical neutrinos among all possible initial source compositions. We find that variation in the flux composition at neutrino telescopes can be a good probe to test such effects. Additionally, we show that a simple extension with heavy sterile neutrino decoherence produces verifiable signatures.</p>

<p>2025-05-22, <strong>Model-Independent Measurement of the Matter-Radiation Equality Scale in DESI 2024</strong>, B. Bahr-Kalus et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16153v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.16153v1</a></p>

<p>The peak of the matter power spectrum, known as the turnover (TO) scale, is determined by the horizon size at the time of matter-radiation equality. This scale can serve as a standard ruler, independent of other features in the matter power spectrum, such as baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). Here, we present the first detection of the turnover in the galaxy auto-power spectrum, utilising the distribution of quasars (QSO) and luminous red galaxies (LRG) measured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) during its first year of survey operations in a model-independent manner. To avoid confirmation bias, we first analyse the data using data blinding methods designed for the DESI baryon acoustic oscillation, redshift space distortion and scale-dependent bias signals. We measure the angle-averaged dilation distance $D_V(z = 1.651) = (38.1\pm 2.5)r_H$ from the quasars and $D_{V}(z = 0.733) = (21.8\pm 1.0)r_H$ from the LRG sample in units of the horizon $r_H$ at the matter-radiation-equality epoch. Combining these two constraints and assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM model with three standard neutrino species, we can translate this into a constraint of $\Omega_{m}h^2 = 0.139^{+0.036}_{-0.046}$. We can break the $\Omega_m$-$H_0$ degeneracy with low-redshift distance measurements from type-Ia supernova (SN) data from Pantheon+, we obtain a sound-horizon free estimate of the Hubble-Lema\^itre parameter of $H_0=65.2^{+4.9}_{-6.2}$ km/s/Mpc, consistent with sound-horizon dependent DESI measurements. On the other hand, combining the DESI BAO and TO, we find a truly DESI-only measurement of $H_0=74.0^{+7.2}_{-3.5}$ km/s/Mpc, in line with DESI-only full-shape results where the sound-horizon scale is marginalised out. This discrepancy in $H_0$ can be reconciled in a $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, where the combination of DESI BAO and TO data yields $H_0 = 66.5\pm 7.2\;\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$.</p>

<p>2025-05-22, <strong>Spontaneous generation of athermal phonons bursts within bulk silicon causing excess noise, low energy background events and quasiparticle poisoning in superconducting sensors</strong>, C. L. Chang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16092v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.16092v1</a></p>

<p>Solid state phonon detectors used in the search for dark matter or coherent neutrino nucleus interactions (CE$\nu$NS) require excellent energy resolution (eV-scale or below) and low backgrounds to meet their science objectives. Unfortunately, an unknown source of phonon bursts (the low energy excess, or ``LEE’’) both dominates all other above threshold background sources and produces shot noise from sub-threshold bursts which greatly exceeds all fundamental noise sources. In this paper, we measure these phonon bursts for 12 days after cool down in two nearly identical multi-phonon sensor channel 1cm$^2$ silicon detectors which differ only in the thickness of their substrate (1 mm vs 4 mm thick). We find that both the correlated shot noise and near threshold shared LEE relax with time since cooldown. Additionally, we show that both shot noise and LEE rates scale linearly with substrate thickness. When combined with previous measurements of other silicon phonon detectors with different substrate geometries and mechanical support strategies, these measurements strongly suggest that the dominant source of both above and below threshold LEE is the bulk substrate. By monitoring the relation between bias power and excess phonon shot noise we estimate that $\varepsilon = \frac{&lt;E^2&gt;}{<e>}$ for sub-threshold noise events is $0.68 \pm 0.38$ meV. In our final dataset, we report a world-leading energy resolution of 258.5$\pm$0.4 meV in the 1mm thick detector. Simple calculations suggest that these Si substrate phonon bursts are likely the dominant source of quasi-particle poisoning in superconducting qubits and sensors that are operated in well shielded and vibration free environments.</e></p>

<p>2025-05-21, <strong>The CRAB facility at the TU Wien TRIGA reactor: status and related physics program</strong>, H. Abele et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15227v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.15227v1</a></p>

<p>The CRAB (Calibrated nuclear Recoils for Accurate Bolometry) project aims to precisely characterize the response of cryogenic detectors to sub-keV nuclear recoils of direct interest for coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering and dark matter search experiments. The CRAB method relies on the radiative capture of thermal neutrons in the target detector, resulting in a nuclear recoil with a well-defined energy. We present a new experimental setup installed at the TRIGA Mark-II reactor at Atominstitut (Vienna), providing a low intensity beam of thermal neutrons sent to the target cryogenic detector mounted inside a wet dilution refrigerator Kelvinox 100. A crown of BaF$_2$ detectors installed outside the dewar enables coincident detection of the high-energy $\gamma$ escaping the target crystal after neutron capture. After the presentation of all components of the setup we report the analysis of first commissioning data with a CaWO$_4$ detector of the \NUCLEUS experiment. They show stable operation of the cryostat and detectors on a week-scale. Due to an energy resolution currently limited to 20 eV we use neutron beam induced events at high energy, in the 10 to 100 keV range, to demonstrate the excellent agreement between the data and simulation and the accurate understanding of external background. Thanks to these data we also propose an updated decay scheme of the low-lying excited states of $^{187}$W. Finally, we present the first evidence of neutron-capture induced coincidences between $\gamma$-detectors and a cryogenic detector. These promising results pave the way for an extensive physics program with various detector materials, like CaWO$_4$, Al$_2$O$_3$, Ge and Si.</p>

<p>2025-05-21, <strong>Sensitivity of the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment to neutrino oscillation parameters using acceleration neutrinos</strong>, Hyper-Kamiokande Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15019v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.15019v1</a></p>

<p>This paper describes the analysis to estimate the sensitivity of the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment to long-baseline neutrino oscillation parameters using accelerator (anti)neutrinos. Results are presented for the CPV discovery sensitivity and precision measurements of the oscillation parameters $\delta_{CP}$, $\sin^2\theta_{23}$, $\Delta m^2_{32}$ and $\sin^2\theta_{13}$. With the assumed Hyper-Kamiokande running plan, a $5\sigma$ CPV discovery is possible in less than three years in the case of maximal CPV and known MO.In the absence of external constraints on the MO, considering the MO sensitivity of the Hyper-Kamiokande measurement using atmospheric neutrinos, the time for a CPV discovery could be estimated to be around six years. Using the nominal final exposure of $27 \times 10^{21}$ protons on target, corresponding to 10 years, with a ratio of 1:3 in neutrino to antineutrino beam mode, we expect to select approximately 10000 charged current, quasi-elastic-like, muon neutrino events, and a similar number of muon anti-neutrino events. In the electron (anti)neutrino appearance channels, we expect approximately 2000 charged current, quasi-elastic-like electron neutrino events and 800 electron antineutrino events. These larges event samples will allow Hyper-Kamiokande to exclude CP conservation at the $5\sigma$significance level for over 60% of the possible true values of $\delta_{CP}$.</p>

<p>2025-05-22, <strong>Broadband Search for Axion Dark Matter via Shift Current</strong>, Dan Kondo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17007v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.17007v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a novel method to detect axion dark matter based on a topological phenomenon known as the shift current. We exploit the second-order nonlinearity of the shift current by applying a strong oscillating electric field. This field enhances the axion-induced shift current signal and downconverts its frequency to a more accessible range. The non-dissipative nature of the shift current allows us to achieve broadband detection via difference frequency generation. We demonstrate, using Type-I Weyl semimetal TaAs property, the possibility of probing the parameter space of the QCD axion in the mass range of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ - $\mathcal{O}(100) \ \rm meV$ corresponding to the photon coupling of $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\simeq$ $\mathcal{O}(10^{-12})$ - $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11})~\text{GeV}^{-1}$, respectively.</p>

<p>The Dark matter Nanosatellite Equipped with Skipper Sensors (DarkNESS) deploys a recently developed skipper-CCD architecture with sub-electron readout noise in low Earth orbit (LEO) to investigate potential signatures of dark matter (DM). The mission addresses two interaction channels: electron recoils from strongly interacting sub-GeV DM and X-rays produced through decaying DM. Orbital observations avoid attenuation that limits ground-based measurements, extending sensitivity reach for both channels. The mission proceeds toward launch following laboratory validation of the instrument. A launch opportunity has been secured through Firefly Aerospace’s DREAM 2.0 program, awarded to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). This will constitute the first use of skipper-CCDs in space and evaluate their suitability for low-noise X-ray and single-photon detection in future space observatories.</p>

<p>2025-05-22, <strong>Constraining anti-baryonic dark matter through correlated nucleon decay signatures</strong>, Mathew Thomas Arun et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16641v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.16641v1</a></p>

<p>Baryon number violation in the visible sector induced by anti-baryonic dark matter provides a viable mechanism for low-scale baryogenesis. Two of the most sensitive probes of this scenario are neutron decay processes such as $n \to \text{invisible}$ and $n \to \pi^0 + \text{invisible}$. In this work, we discuss the generation of di-nucleon decay processes such as $nn \to \bar{\nu}\bar{\nu}$ and $nn \to \pi^0\pi^0$ at one-loop, arising from the operators responsible for induced nucleon decays. While nucleon decay rates in this model depend on the local dark matter density, di-nucleon decay processes do not, providing a complementary probe of the new physics. We thus use bounds on both nucleon and di-nucleon decays to constrain the mass and terrestrial density of anti-baryonic dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-05-22, <strong>Unveiling the inert Triplet desert region with a pNGB Dark Matter and its Gravitational Wave signatures</strong>, Pankaj Borah et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16521v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.16521v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we extend the scalar sector of the conventional hyperchargeless inert triplet model (ITM) to include a second dark matter (DM) candidate, which appears to be a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB). The usual ITM with an extended scalar sector offers a DM candidate along with novel signatures at different experiments, e.g., colliders, gravitational wave detectors, etc. Nevertheless, hitherto unseen experimental detections have placed stringent constraints on the ITM parameter space. Moreover, triplet masses lighter than $1.9$ TeV, consistent with the existing or upcoming collider sensitivity reach, are already excluded from the DM observable, as they yield an underabundant relic density due to a strong $SU(2)_L$ gauge annihilation. Inclusion of a pNGB DM, via a complex $SU(2)_L$ scalar singlet and through the soft-breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry, helps to revive the sub-TeV regime of the triplet DM. This resurgence relies on a proficient conversion between the two DM species. Using this inter-conversion, with the triplet DM as the lighter one between the two, we show that it is possible to push the triplet DM contribution to $50\% - 60\%$ of the total relic density. This offers a significant improvement over the traditional ITM with a single DM candidate, where the same can at most reach $10\% - 20\%$. Besides, the concerned bipartite DM framework also offers the possibility of a first-order phase transition along various constituent field directions. Among these, the one along the real $SU(2)_L$ singlet direction can be a strong one which subsequently yields detectable gravitational wave signals at the upcoming space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, BBO, DECIGO, etc., alongside distinctive and complementary signatures at the various DM and collider quests.</p>

<p>2025-05-22, <strong>Exploring parametrized dark energy models in interacting scenario</strong>, Sangita Goswami et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16438v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.16438v1</a></p>

<p>In the present work, we have studied the dynamics of accelerating universe considering a simple parametrization of the equation of state parameter in an interacting scenario. In this toy model, the dark energy component is allowed to interact with the dark matter component through a source term. The expressions for various relevant cosmological parameters for the proposed parametrized model have been obtained and it has been found that the proposed model consistently drives the late time cosmic acceleration of the universe. We have also carried out the Bayesian analysis using recent observational datasets in order to obtain the best fit values of the model parameters. It has been found that the dark energy model with $Q \propto H\rho_{de}$ can provide a possible resolution of the Hubble tension in an interacting scenario where the dark energy component decays into the dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-05-22, <strong>Determining non-symmetric dark matter halo around magnetars with two fluid approach</strong>, Asit karan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16359v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.16359v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the impact of dark matter on the structure and deformation of magnetars. We assume a perturbative approach for the magnetic field deformation and that the dark matter only interacts gravitationally with hardonic matter. Assuming that the DM is significantly softer than HM, we find that the magnetic field can affect dark matter through the deformation of space-time. The number of stars having a dark matter halo outside the hadronic matter surface increases with an increase in dark matter fraction and the stiffness of the dark matter equation of state. As the magnetic field deforms the stars from sphericity, we can have a situation where we have a non-symmetric dark matter halo outside the star. This can have interesting observational gravitational signatures unique to magnetars with having DM halo.</p>

<p>2025-05-22, <strong>Anisotropic quantum universe in Hořava-Lifshitz gravity</strong>, Vikramaditya Mondal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16266v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.16266v1</a></p>

<p>We quantize a Bianchi IX universe in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory. For analytical tractability, we consider the small anisotropy limit of the Bianchi IX, that is, a perturbative anisotropic deformation of a closed, homogeneous and isotropic universe. In the case of the projectable theory we further set the ``dark matter as integration constant’’ to zero by assuming that the space consists of only one connected piece. In that limit and under the assumption, we first study the semi-classical WKB solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We find the wave function of the universe, up to an overall normalization, and estimate the semi-classical tunneling probability for the emergence of an expanding universe. We establish a dictionary of correspondence between the WKB wave functions in General Relativity and Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory in the large-scale factor (or IR) limit. For a small universe (UV limit), on the other hand, due to contributions from higher-dimensional operators, the anisotropies decouple from the scale factor, a behavior significantly different from General Relativity, and analytic solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation beyond the WKB approximation can be found. The wave function of the scale factor satisfies the DeWitt criterion, whereas the wave functions of anisotropies resemble those of quantum harmonic oscillators. The quantum prediction for the initial condition of anisotropies is obtained in terms of the coupling parameters of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory. We find a bound on the coupling parameters from the normalizability of the wave functions of anisotropies. Further, we calculate the expectation values for squared anisotropic shear and squared anisotropies in both the large universe and small universe limits.</p>

<p>In this work, we study a dark matter scenario where a dark Z boson possessing mass mixing with the SM Z boson couples to the DM candidate and serves as the portal to the SM. The UV origin of the mass mixing in the form of an extra dark Higgs doublet and a scalar dark singlet provides new exotic scalars which can constitute the final state of DM annihilation during freeze-out. We find that existing constraints on the observed Higgs coupling strength, exotic Higgs searches and dark matter observables complement each other, while future searches for exotic Higgs decays and resonant heavy scalars at HL-LHC will be sensitive to part of the allowed parameter space.</p>

<p>We show that the gravothermal collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos can deviate from local thermodynamic equilibrium. As a consequence, the self-similar evolution predicted by the commonly adopted conducting fluid model can be altered or broken. Our results are obtained using a novel, efficient kinetic solver called KiSS-SIDM for tracing the gravothermal evolution based on the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) framework. In the long mean free path stage, the code is a viable alternative to the fluid model, yet requires no calibration parameters. Further, this method enables a fully kinetic treatment well into the late, short mean free path, stage of the collapse. We apply the method to a canonical case with isotropic, velocity independent scattering. We find that although a fluid treatment is appropriate deep in the short mean free path core, departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium develop in the intermediate mean free path region bounding the core, which modify the late-time evolution.</p>

<p>2025-05-21, <strong>Dark Matter Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is Sensitive to Dark Photons and the Axion-Photon Coupling</strong>, Carl Beadle et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15897v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.15897v1</a></p>

<p>We demonstrate that nuclear magnetic resonance based searches for dark matter (DM) have intrinsic and powerful sensitivity to dark photons and the axion-photon coupling. The reason is conceptually straightforward. An instrument such as CASPEr-Gradient begins with a large sample of nuclear spins polarised in a background magnetic field. In the presence of axion DM coupled to nucleons, the spin ensemble feels an effective magnetic field $\mathbf{B} \propto \nabla a$ that tilts the spins, generating a potentially observable precession. If the magnetic field is real rather than effective, the system responds identically. A real field can be generated by a kinetically mixed dark photon within the shielded region the sample is placed or an axion coupled to photons through its interaction with the background magnetic field. We show that all three signals are detectable and distinguishable. If CASPEr-Gradient were to reach the QCD axion prediction of the axion-nucleon coupling, it would simultaneously be sensitive to kinetic mixings of $\epsilon \simeq 3 \times 10^{-16}$ and axion-photon couplings of $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \simeq 2 \times 10^{-16}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for $m \simeq 1\,\mu{\rm eV}$.</p>

<p>2025-05-21, <strong>String Theory and Grand Unification Suggest a Sub-Microelectronvolt QCD Axion</strong>, Joshua N. Benabou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15884v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.15884v1</a></p>

<p>Axions, grand unification, and string theory are each compelling extensions of the Standard Model. We show that combining these frameworks imposes strong constraints on the QCD axion mass. Using unitarity arguments and explicit string compactifications - such as those from the Kreuzer-Skarke (KS) type IIB ensemble - we find that the axion mass is favored to lie within the range $10^{-11}$ eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim$ $10^{-8}$ eV. This range is directly relevant for near-future axion dark matter searches, including ABRACADABRA/DMRadio and CASPEr. We argue that grand unification and the absence of proton decay suggest a compactification volume that keeps the string scale above the unification scale ($\sim$$10^{16}$ GeV), which in turn limits how heavy the axion can be. The same requirements limit the KS axiverse to have at most $\sim$47 axions. As an additional application of our methodology, we search for axions in the KS axiverse that could explain the recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) hints of evolving dark energy but find none with high enough decay constant ($f_a \gtrsim 2.5 \times 10^{17}$ GeV); we comment on why such high decay constants and low axion masses are difficult to obtain in string compactifications more broadly.</p>

<p>2025-05-21, <strong>Direct Detection of Cosmic Walls with Paleo Detectors</strong>, Wen Yin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15764v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.15764v1</a></p>

<p>Paleo detectors are emerging dark matter detection technology that exploits ancient minerals as passive, time-integrated detectors. Unlike conventional real-time experiments, they search for permanent damage tracks-typically tens of nanometers to micrometers long-left in crystal lattices by rare particle interactions, most notably dark matter induced nuclear recoils accumulated over millions to billions of years. In this paper I propose a direct detection strategy for cosmic walls-either bubble walls produced by a late-time first-order phase transition or domain walls in a scaling regime-using paleo detectors as the target medium. Because the cosmic wall is expected to traverse Earth at most $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time(s) in cosmic history, an ancient, continuously exposed detector is the only feasible way to observe it directly. By calculating the target recoils, I find that the smoking-gun signature would be parallel damage tracks found worldwide in minerals older than the wall-crossing epoch. I derive the limit on the wall-target coupling by assuming that a wall passed through the Earth within the last 0.5 Gyr. I also mention a novel indirect detection of ultra-relativistic cosmic walls by noting the induced cosmic rays.</p>

Nakazono et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15619v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.15619v1</a></p>

<p>We report the results of a search for dark photon dark matter using a cavity that employs a transmon qubit as a frequency tuning component. The tuning mechanism utilizes the energy level shift (Lamb shift) arising from the mode mixing between the qubit and the cavity mode. This method offers several advantages: (i) it does not introduce physical thermal noise from the tuning mechanism itself, (ii) it avoids electromagnetic leakage typically associated with cavity seams, and (iii) its implementation is straightforward. We excluded the dark photon parameter region for a dark photon mass around $36.1 \ \mathrm{\mu eV} $with a peak sensitivity of $\chi \sim 10^{-12}$ over the mass range $[36.0791, 36.1765] \ \mathrm{\mu eV}$, surpassing the existing cosmological bounds.</p>

<p>Stellar streams are essential tracers of the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, with key implications to the problem of dark matter (DM) model distributions, either within or beyond phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM halos. For the first time in the literature, a DM halo model based on first physical principles such as quantum statistical mechanics and thermodynamics is used to try to reproduce the 6D observations of the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream. We model both DM haloes, the one of Sgr dwarf and the one of its host with a spherical self-gravitating system of neutral fermions which accounts for the effects of particles escape and fermion degeneracy, the latter causing a high-density core at the center of the halo. Full baryonic components for each galaxy are also considered. We use a spray algorithm with $\sim 10^{5}$ particles to generate the Sgr tidal debris, which evolves in the gravitational potential of the host-progenitor system, to compare with the full phase-space data of the stream. We repeat this kind of simulations for different parameter setups of the fermionic model including the particle mass, with special attention to test different DM halo morphologies allowed by the physics. We find that across the different families of fermionic halo models, they can only reproduce the trailing arm of the Sgr stream. Within the observationally allowed span of enclosed masses where the stream moves, neither the power-law like, nor the polytropic behaviour of the fermionic halo models can answer for the observed trend of the leading tail. A conclusion which is shared by former analysis using other type of spherically symmetric haloes. We conclude that further model sophistications such as abandoning spherical symmetry and including the Large Magellanic Cloud perturber are needed for a proper modelisation of the overall Milky Way potential within this kind of first principle halo models.</p>

<p>The Dehnen - type dark matter density distribution model is mainly used for dwarf galaxies. In recent years, researchers have speculated that black holes may exist in this dark matter model and have given the black hole metric solutions. On this basis, this paper conducts a systematic study on the quasinormal modes of a Schwarzschild black hole in a Dehnen - (1,4, 5/2) dark matter halo, revealing the influences of dark matter distribution and perturbation field types on the black hole’s quasinormal modes.The research uses the shadow radius data of the M87$^{\ast}$ black hole. Through the geodesic equation, two sets of dark matter halo parameter values of $\rho_{\rm s}$ and $r_{\rm s}$ are determined, and the specific numerical values of the black hole’s event horizon radius, photon sphere radius, and shadow radius under the corresponding conditions are obtained. The wave equations and effective potentials of the black hole under the perturbations of the scalar field, electromagnetic field, and axial gravitational were analyzed. It was found that the larger the values of $\rho_{\rm s}$ or $r_{\rm s}$, the smaller the peak value of the effective potential, and the wave function oscillation slows down with a lower frequency. The black hole remains stable under perturbations. These studies provide relevant data for the quasinormal modes of the Schwarzschild black hole in the Dehnen-(1,4, 5/2) type dark matter halo. They also offer crucial evidence for understanding the interaction mechanism between the black hole and the dark matter halo.</p>

<p>Primordial black holes (PBHs), envisioned as a compelling dark matter candidate and a window onto early-Universe physics, may contribute to the part of the gravitational-wave (GW) signals detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network. Traditional hierarchical Bayesian analysis, which relies on precise GW-event posterior estimates, for extracting the information of potential PBH population from GW events become computationally prohibitive for catalogs of hundreds of events. Here, we present a fast deep-learning framework, leveraging Transformer and normalizing flows, that maps GW-event posterior samples to joint posterior distributions over the hyperparameters of the PBH population. Our approach yields accurate credible intervals while reducing end-to-end inference time to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ s on a single GPU. These results underscore the potential of deep learning for fast, high-accurately PBH population studies in the era of next-generation GW detectors.</p>

<p>2025-05-21, <strong>Constraining scalar-tensor theories from higher harmonics with GW230529</strong>, Baoxiang Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15448v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.15448v1</a></p>

<p>The Advanced LIGO and Virgo collaborations recently detected a gravitational wave event, GW230529\_181500, during the fourth observing run, which is most plausibly attributed to the merger of a neutron star and a black hole. This observation provides an opportunity to test a class of gravitational theories that deviate from general relativity. In such theories, additional terms contribute to the gravitational wave signal only in cases of asymmetric binaries. This study focuses on two scalar-tensor models within this class of theories: the Screened Modified Gravity and Brans-Dicke theory. These models have potential applications in areas such as dark matter, dark energy, cosmic inflation, and primordial nucleosynthesis. With the GW230529\_181500 and Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo analyses, we derive a 90\% credible lower bound as $ \frac{\varphi_{\rm_{VEV}}}{M_{\rm Pl}}&lt;1.7\times10^{-2}$ and $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;25.12$ by using dominant-mode correction. Asymmetric binary systems usually have a significant mass ratio, in such cases, higher harmonic modes cannot be neglected. Our work considers higher harmonic corrections from scalar-tensor theories and provides a tighter constraint of $ \frac{\varphi_{\rm_{VEV}}}{M_{\rm Pl}}&lt;1.5\times10^{-2}$ and $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;32.68$, with a 13.3\% and 30.1\% improvement respectively. Combining GW230529\_181500, GW200115 and GW190814 and including higher modes, the constraint is improved to $\frac{\varphi_{\rm_{VEV}}}{M_{\rm Pl}}&lt;7.84\times10^{-3}$ and $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;123.75$. This is currently the strongest constraint from GWs, contingent upon GW190814 being an NSBH event.</p>

<p>We demonstrate that general relativistic corrections to the accretion of relativistic matter onto primordial black holes (PBHs) can significantly enhance their mass growth during the early Universe. Contrary to previous Newtonian treatments, our analysis reveals that PBH masses can increase by an order of magnitude before evaporation, leading to substantial modifications of their lifetime and cosmological imprints. We quantify the resulting shifts in the minimum PBH mass constrained by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), the revised lower bound for PBHs surviving today, and the dark matter parameter space allowed by PBH evaporation. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced accretion alters the high-frequency gravitational wave spectrum from PBH evaporation, potentially within the reach of future detectors. Our results provide a comprehensive, relativistically consistent framework to delineate the role of PBHs in early-universe cosmology and dark matter phenomenology.</p>

<p>2025-05-21, <strong>Comparison of simulations and semi-analytical model for WDM subhalo mass functions</strong>, Mizuki Ono et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15226v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.15226v1</a></p>

<p>The Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model successfully explains large-scale structure formation, but challenges remain at smaller scales, leading to interest in Warm Dark Matter (WDM) as an alternative. The abundance of Milky Way subhalos depends on the mass of WDM particles, allowing constraints to be obtained by comparing observations and theoretical models. However, high-resolution simulations of heavier WDM particle masses are computationally demanding, making semi-analytical approaches valuable. In this study, we evaluate the ability of the Semi-Analytical Sub-Halo Inference Modeling for WDM (SASHIMI-W) to reproduce subhalo mass functions for heavier WDM particle masses. We perform high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations for CDM and WDM with particle masses of 1 keV, 3 keV, and 10 keV, and compare the ratio of the subhalo mass function between WDM and CDM cases. Our results show that SASHIMI-W successfully reproduces the simulation results over redshifts z = 0 to z = 2. Furthermore, both simulations and the semi-analytical model show a slight redshift dependence in the subhalo suppression ratio. However, a direct comparison of the differential subhalo mass functions shows discrepancies in the mid- and low-mass regions, suggesting that the tidal stripping effects implemented in SASHIMI-W may be too strong for WDM subhalos, or that the removal of spurious subhalos in the simulations is insufficient. These results validate the use of SASHIMI-W in constraining WDM properties, and highlight the need for refinements in both tidal effect modeling and spurious subhalo filtering to improve subhalo abundance predictions.</p>

<p>2025-05-21, <strong>Geometric formulation of $k$-essence and late-time acceleration</strong>, Lehel Csillag et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15975v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.15975v1</a></p>

<p>We study a class of geometries in which nonmetricity is fully determined by a vectorial degree of freedom and three independent coefficients. Formulating the simplest linear action in this geometry, implemented through Lagrange multipliers, naturally leads to an equivalence with the purely kinetic $k$-essence models with quadratic kinetic terms. A detailed dynamical systems analysis reveals that the $\Lambda$CDM phenomenology is embedded within the model. Crucially, we find that if stability conditions such as a positive sound speed squared and non-negative energy density are not enforced, the model generically exhibits instabilities and divergent behaviour in the phase space. These physical viability criteria allow us to isolate stable regions of the parameter space and derive well-motivated priors for parameter inference. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and late-time observational data, including cosmic chronometers, Pantheon$^{+}$ Type Ia supernovae, and DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, we constrain the degrees of freedom associated with nonmetricity and demonstrate the viability of the model. Remarkably, the model is found to be statistically indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM at late times. We discuss the implications of these results in light of the recent cosmic tensions, and give a possible explanation as to why the equivalent $k$-essence models have been missed as serious competitors to $\Lambda$CDM in the past. Finally, we review the geometric foundations of the theory and show that the integrable Weyl, Schr"{o}dinger and completely symmetric geometries are embedded within our framework as special cases.</p>

<p>2025-05-21, <strong>Current constraints on the minimally extended varying speed of light model through the cosmic distance duality relation</strong>, Jaiane Santos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15768v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.15768v1</a></p>

<p>One of the most crucial tests of the standard cosmological model consists on testing possible variations on fundamental physical constants. In frameworks such as the minimally extended varying speed of light model (meVSL), the relationship between the luminosity distance ($D_{\text{L}}$) and the angular diameter distance ($D_{\text{A}}$), namely the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), is expected to deviate from $\eta(z) \equiv D_{\text{L}}(z)/D_{\text{A}}(z) = (1+z)^{2}$, making it a powerful probe of a potential variation of such a fundamental constant. Hence, we test the viability of the meVSL model through the CDDR by comparing $D_{\text{A}}$ measurements, provided by the transverse (2D) and anisotropic (3D) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) observations from different surveys, like SDSS, DES and DESI, in combination with $D_{\text{L}}$ measurements from Pantheon+ type Ia Supernova (SNe) compilation. The Gaussian Process reconstruction is employed on the SN data to match $D_{\text{A}}$ with $D_{\text{L}}$ at the same redshift. We find no deviation of the standard CDDR relation within 1-2$\sigma$ confidence level when considering SNe with 2D and 3D BAO samples combined together, as well as when considering SNe with 3D BAO only. However, when SNe and 2D BAO only are considered, the standard CDDR is only recovered at $\sim 4\sigma$ confidence level. However, such a result might be due to some recently discussed tensions between SN and BAO datasets, especially at low redshifts, in addition to possible inconsistencies between the BAO datasets individually. Therefore, our results show no significant evidence in favour of the meVSL model, once these potential systematics are taken into account.</p>

<p>2025-05-21, <strong>Stellar population modelling of neutron stars and black holes: spatially-resolved graveyards in MaNGA/SDSS-IV galaxies</strong>, Claudia Maraston et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15691v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.15691v1</a></p>

<p>We update our stellar population models for the time evolution of the number and mass of massive remnants - neutron stars and black holes - with a new initial mass-remnant mass relation for core collapse supernovae. The calculations are based on hydrodynamical simulations and induced explosions of a subset of previously published pre-supernovae models spanning a wide range of stellar mass, metallicity and different values for rotation velocity. The resulting stellar population models predict lower numbers of neutron stars (by up to 0.3 dex) and higher numbers of black holes (by up to 0.8 dex), especially when stellar rotation is considered. The mass fraction locked in neutron stars and black holes is lowest in high-metallicity populations, with the largest number of remnants found at about half-solar metallicity. This mirrors the amount of available gas, ranging from 35 per cent to 45 per cent. We then apply our new models to IFU spectra for ~10,000 galaxies from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA survey for which we previously published spatially-resolved star formation histories. This allows us to probe spatially-resolved graveyards in galaxies of different types. The number and radial distribution of remnants depend on a galaxy’s mass, star formation history and metal content. More massive and hence more metal-rich galaxies are found to host fewer remnants. Radial gradients in the number of remnants depend on galaxy mass mostly because of the mass-dependent profiles in mass density: the gradients are flat in low-mass galaxies, and negative in high-mass galaxies, particularly in Milky Way analogues.</p>

<p>2025-05-21, <strong>Implementation of CR Energy SPectrum (CRESP) algorithm in PIERNIK MHD code. II.

<p>We developed a new model for the production and propagation of spectrally resolved primary and secondary Cosmic Ray (CR) nuclei elements within the framework of the Cosmic Ray Energy Spectrum (CRESP) module of the PIERNIK MHD code. We extend the algorithm to several CR nuclei and demonstrate our code’s capability to model primary and secondary CR species simultaneously. Primary C, N, and O are accelerated in supernova (SN) remnants. In contrast, the spallation collisions of the primary nuclei against the thermal ISM protons lead to secondary Li, Be, and B products. All the CR species evolve according to the momentum-dependent Fokker-Planck equations that are dynamically coupled to the MHD system of equations governing the evolution of the ISM. We demonstrate the operation of this system in the gravity-stratified box, reproducing the Milky Way conditions in the Sun’s local environment. We perform a parameter study by investigating the impact of the SN rate, CR parallel diffusion coefficient $D_\parallel$, and the rigidity-dependent diffusion coefficient power index $\delta$. A novel result of our investigation is that the Secondary to Primary flux ratio \BtoC grows when the diffusion coefficient grows, due to the weaker vertical magnetic field resulting from CR buoyancy effects. Moreover, a higher SN rate leads to lower values of \BtoC because of stronger winds and the shorter residence of primary CR particles in dense disk regions.</p>
