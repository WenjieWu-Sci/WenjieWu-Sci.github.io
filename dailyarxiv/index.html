<p>2025-08-19, <strong>Implementation of the Martini-Ericson-Chanfray-Marteau RPA-based (anti)neutrino cross-section model in the GENIE neutrino event generator</strong>, Lavinia Russo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13939v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13939v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the first implementation of the Martini-Ericson-Chanfray-Marteau RPA-based (anti)neutrino cross-section model for quasielastic (1p1h) and multinucleon (2p2h and 3p3h) excitations in the widely used GENIE neutrino event generator. Validation steps are presented, in particular, through direct comparisons of GENIE cross section output with original calculations performed by the authors of the model. Predictions for $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O and $^{40}$Ar are compared with some available T2K and MicroBooNE experimental measurements showing a reasonable agreement.</p>

<p>2025-08-19, <strong>Offline Neutrino Filtering using a Convolutional Neural Network-Based Algorithm at the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland</strong>, Ruben Camphyn et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13860v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13860v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino astronomy is a vibrant field of study in astrophysics, offering unique insights into the Universe’s most energetic phenomena. The combination of a low cross section and zero electromagnetic charge ensure that a neutrino retains most information about its original source while traversing the universe. On the other hand, these low cross sections, combined with a reduced flux at higher energies, make the neutrino one of the most elusive particles to detect in the standard model. The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) aims to detect sporadic neutrino interactions in the Greenlandic ice sheet by means of electromagnetic signals in the radio frequency range, induced by the produced charged secondary particles. The low incoming neutrino flux forces the detector to set a low trigger threshold, leading to the measured data being overwhelmed by thermal noise fluctuations. Hence, a sophisticated and robust filter is needed to differentiate between neutrino-like signals and noise. In this contribution we present the current work on the development of such a filter, based on a convolutional neural network architecture. The network employed uses real RNO-G data and simulated neutrino signals to categorize measured data as noise or neutrino-like events.</p>

<p>2025-08-19, <strong>Froggatt-Nielsen like mechanism in the framework of Modular Symmetry for Neutrino Mass, Mixing and Leptogenesis</strong>, Gourab Pathak et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13578v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13578v1</a></p>

<p>We study a neutrino mass model with Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) like modular symmetry. The FN mechanism requires an additional gauge symmetry, $U(1)_{FN}$, which is spontaneously broken at high energies. But in this work, we do not need an extra symmetry as modular weights play the role of the FN charges of the additional $U(1)_{FN}$ symmetry. We have constructed a neutrino mass model using FN-like modular symmetry in the $T’$ group. This model can accommodate neutrino oscillation parameters and also address other phenomena beyond the Standard Model, such as neutrinoless double beta decay and the baryon asymmetry of the universe.</p>

<p>2025-08-18, <strong>Transfer Learning for Neutrino Scattering: Domain Adaptation with GANs</strong>, Jose L. Bonilla et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12987v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.12987v1</a></p>

<p>We utilize transfer learning to extrapolate the physics knowledge encoded in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model trained on synthetic charged-current (CC) neutrino-carbon inclusive scattering data. This base model is adapted to generate CC inclusive scattering events (lepton kinematics only) for neutrino-argon and antineutrino-carbon interactions. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of transfer learning in re-optimizing a custom model when new data comes from a different neutrino-nucleus interaction model. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly outperforms training generative models from scratch. To study this, we consider two training data sets: one with 10,000 and another with 100,000 events. The models obtained via transfer learning perform well even with smaller training data. The proposed method provides a promising approach for constructing neutrino scattering event generators in scenarios where experimental data is sparse.</p>

<p>2025-08-19, <strong>Explaining Data Anomalies over the NMSSM Parameter Space with Deep Learning Techniques</strong>, A. Hammad et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13912v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13912v1</a></p>

<p>Motivated by recent results from particle physics analyses, we investigate the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) as a framework capable of accommodating a range of current data anomalies across low- and high-energy experiments. These include the so-called 95GeV and 650GeV excesses from Higgs studies, the Electro-Weakino excess from Supersymmetry searches, the latest $(g-2)_\mu$ measurements as well as potential deviations from Standard Model (SM) predictions that would appear as a consequence in mono-$H$ (where $H=h_{\rm SM}$) and -$Z$ signatures of Dark Matter. Our analysis demonstrates that viable NMSSM parameter regions exist where all these features can be accommodated at the $2\sigma$ level while remaining consistent with the most up-to-date theoretical and experimental constraints. To identify such regions, we employ an efficient numerical scanning strategy assisted by deep learning techniques. We further present several benchmark points that realize these scenarios, offering promising directions for future phenomenological studies.</p>

<p>2025-08-19, <strong>Discriminating scalar ultralight dark matter from quasi-monochromatic gravitational waves in LISA</strong>, Jordan Gué et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13847v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13847v1</a></p>

<p>A scalar ultralight dark matter (ULDM) candidate would induce oscillatory motion of freely falling test masses via its coupling to Standard Model fields. Such oscillations would create an observable Doppler shift of light exchanged between the test masses, and in particular would be visible in space-based gravitational waves (GW) detectors, such as LISA. While this kind of detection has been proposed multiple times in the recent years, we numerically investigate if it is possible to extract a scalar ULDM signal in a space-based GW detector, and in particular how to differentiate such a signal from a GW signal. Using one year of realistic orbits for the LISA spacecrafts and Bayesian methods, we find that LISA will indeed be able to discriminate between the two signals.</p>

<p>2025-08-19, <strong>The Hidden Role of Anisotropies in Shaping Structure Formation in Cosmological N-Body Simulations</strong>, Francesco Sylos Labini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13765v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13765v1</a></p>

<p>Initial conditions in cosmological $N$-body simulations are typically generated by displacing particles from a regular cubic lattice using a correlated field derived from the linear power spectrum, often via the Zel’dovich approximation. While this procedure reproduces the target two-point statistics (e.g., the power spectrum or correlation function), it introduces subtle anisotropies due to the underlying lattice structure. These anisotropies, invisible to angle-averaged diagnostics, become evident through directional measures such as the Angular Distribution of Pairwise Distances. Analyzing two Cold Dark Matter simulations with varying resolutions, initial redshifts, and box sizes, we show that these anisotropies are not erased but are amplified by gravitational evolution. They seed filamentary structures that persist into the linear regime, remaining visible even at redshift $z = 0$. Our findings demonstrate that such features are numerical artifacts – emerging from the anisotropic coupling between the displacement field and the lattice – not genuine predictions of an isotropic cosmological model. These results underscore the importance of critically reassessing how initial conditions are constructed, particularly when probing the large-scale, quasi-linear regime of structure formation.</p>

<p>2025-08-19, <strong>The Milky Way is a less massive galaxy–new estimates of the Milky Way’s local and global stellar masses</strong>, Jianhui Lian et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13665v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13665v1</a></p>

<p>Stellar mass is the most fundamental property of a galaxy. While it has been robustly measured for millions of external galaxies, it remains poorly constrained for the Milky Way because of the strong selection effect from our inside perspective. In this work, we reconstruct the intrinsic vertical mass density profile in the solar neighborhood and the radial mass density profile across the entire Galaxy using data from the Gaia and APOGEE surveys, following careful correction for the selection function. The local density profile exhibits strong north-south asymmetry in the geometric thick disk regime and increases steeply toward the disk mid-plane, favoring an exponential model over the sech$^2$ model. Integrating the local vertical density profile yields a surface stellar mass density of 31.563$\pm$2.813(syst.)$\pm$0.024(stoch.)~${\rm M_{\odot}pc^{-2}}$, of which 25.074 and 6.489~${\rm M_{\odot}pc^{-2}}$ correspond to living stars and stellar remnants, respectively. The radial surface mass density profile {of the Milky Way} shares the same flat inner component as observed in the brightness profile. With this mass density profile {and local mass density from Gaia}, we derive a new estimate of the total stellar mass of the Milky Way of 2.607$\pm$0.353(syst.)$\pm$0.085(stoch.)${\rm \times10^{10}M_{\odot}}$, a factor of two lower than the previous results. This discrepancy arises primarily from the inner disk profile, which was previously unavailable and extrapolated from the outer disk profile. The lower stellar mass estimate of the Milky Way significantly reduces its rarity in terms of supermassive black hole mass among external galaxies and implies a larger dark matter-to-baryon mass ratio in the inner Galaxy.</p>

<p>2025-08-19, <strong>Inert dark matter in three Higgs doublet model: a blind spot narrative</strong>, Amit Dutta Banik et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13583v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13583v1</a></p>

<p>We explore the phenomenology of three Higgs doublet scenario, where the scalar potential is augmented by $\mathbb{Z}_{3} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry making one doublet inert. Thus in effect, our model of interest is two Higgs plus inert Higgs doublet model charged under $\mathbb{Z}_3$ ((2+I)HDM-$\mathbb{Z}_3$) symmetry. We observe a blind spot feature for dark matter direct detection, as the tree-level dark matter-nucleon scattering cross-section vanishes depending on the mass splitting of dark sector particles. We perform a detailed analysis based on vacuum stability, unitarity, relic abundance, and direct detection results on the model. We also perform profile likelihood analysis and constrain the corresponding parameter space.</p>

<p>2025-08-19, <strong>Constraints on Compact Dark Matter Population from Micro-lensing Effect of Gravitational Wave for the third-generation gravitational Wave Detector</strong>, Xin-Yi Lin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13577v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13577v1</a></p>

<p>Since the pioneering detection of gravitational wave (GW) from a binary black hole merger by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, GW has become a powerful tool for probing astrophysics and cosmology. If compact dark matter (DM) candidates, e.g. primordial black holes, contribute a substantial fraction of the DM component across a broad mass spectrum, their gravitational influence would imprint distinctive micro-lensing signatures on long-wavelength GW signals. In this paper, we propose a systematic method ranging from simulating micro-lensing GWs to constraining population information of compact DM, combining future third-generation ground-based GW detector, i.e. Einstein Telescope, with a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework. This approach enables us to analyze micro-lensing signatures in GW events and probe the potential contribution of compact DM objects to the DM budget of universe. For a population with a power-law mass function, we demonstrate that detecting 8 micro-lensing GW events out of $10^4$ observed binary black holes would constrain the compact DM abundance to $\log_{10}(f_{\rm CO})=-2.76^{+0.16}_{-0.17}$.</p>

<p>2025-08-19, <strong>Complementarity between gravitational wave signatures and Higgs precision measurements of a classically conformal hidden U(1) extended Standard Model</strong>, Victor Baules et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13527v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13527v1</a></p>

<p>We consider a classically conformal extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a hidden $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, where the $U(1)$ symmetry is radiatively broken via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. This radiative breaking then induces electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking through a negative mixed quartic coupling between the hidden sector Higgs field and the SM Higgs doublet. Due to the mixed quartic coupling, the original two Higgs fields mix with a small angle $\theta$ to form two mass eigenstates, $h_1$ (SM-like Higgs) and $h_2$ (SM singlet-like Higgs). Setting their masses as $M_{h_1} &gt; 2 M_{h_2}$ to allow the decay process, $h_1 \to h_2 h_2$, we find a remarkable prediction of the conformal Higgs potential: the corresponding decay width is strongly suppressed in contrast to the one in the conventional Higgs potential. This anomalous behavior provides a striking experimental signature testable at the International Linear Collider (ILC) and other future high-energy lepton colliders. In this work, we investigate further experimental signatures of the model which are complementary to the Higgs physics at the colliders. First, we study the hidden $U(1)$ gauge boson as a cold dark matter (DM) candidate. While we find parameter regions consistent with both the observed relic abundance and collider sensitivities, these regions are excluded by current direct DM detection limits. Second, we consider a strong first-order phase transition associated with hidden $U(1)$ breaking in the early universe and compute the resulting gravitational wave (GW) spectrum. We find that for parameter regions complementary to Higgs precision measurements at the ILC, the predicted GW signals lie well above the projected sensitivities of future GW observatories.</p>

<p>2025-08-18, <strong>Beyond the two-point correlation: constraining primordial non-gaussianity with density perturbation moments</strong>, Ethan Vislosky et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13381v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13381v1</a></p>

<p>Constraining primordial non-Gaussianities (PNGs) in the large-scale cosmic structure (LSS) is an important step in understanding properties of the early universe, specifically in distinguishing between different inflationary models. Measuring PNG relies on evaluating the scale-dependent correlations in the density field. New summary statistics beyond the two- and three-point correlation functions in configuration space and their Fourier-space counterparts, the power- and bi-spectrum may provide increased sensitivity. We introduce a new method for extracting the PNG signal imprinted on the LSS by using the first three Gaussian moments of the normalized correlation in density perturbations, evaluated at varying distance scales. We aim to assess this method’s sensitivity to local PNG, parameterized by $f_ {\mathrm{NL}}$. We perform spherical convolutions at a range of scales on dark matter halo simulations to measure the scale-dependent correlations in the density field. From these, we compute the first three moments and compare them to a model expectation vector, parameterized to the second power in $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$. Our method provides about 21% improvement in sensitivity to $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ with respect to using the two point correlation function alone. Notably, we find that the second moment alone carries nearly as much constraining power as the mean, highlighting the potential of higher-order statistics. Given its simplicity and efficiency, this framework is well-suited for application to current and upcoming large-scale surveys such as DESI.</p>

<p>2025-08-18, <strong>Deformations of Starobinsky Inflation in No-Scale SU(5) and SO(10) GUTs</strong>, John Ellis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13279v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13279v1</a></p>

<p>The original Starobinsky $R + R^2$ model of inflation is consistent with Planck and other measurements of the CMB, but recent results from the ACT and SPT Collaborations hint that the tilt of scalar perturbations may be in tension with the prediction of the Starobinsky model. No-scale models of inflation can reproduce the predictions of the Starobinsky model, but also provide a framework for incorporating deformations that could accommodate more easily the ACT and SPT data. We discuss this possibility in the contexts of SU(5) GUTs, taking into account the constraints on these models imposed by the longevity of the proton, the cold dark matter density and the measured value of the Higgs boson. We find that SU(5) with a CMSSM-like pattern of soft supersymmetry breaking has difficulty in accommodating all the constraints, whereas SU(5) with pure gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking can accommodate them easily. We also consider two SO(10) symmetry-breaking patterns that can accommodate the ACT and SPT data. In both the SU(5) and SO(10) models, the deformations avoid issues associated with large initial field values in the Starobinsky model: in particular, the total number of e-folds is largely independent of the initial conditions.</p>

<p>2025-08-18, <strong>Probing Purely Inelastic Scalar Dark Matter Across Colliders and Gravitational Wave Observatories</strong>, Jinhui Guo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13276v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13276v1</a></p>

<p>We propose and study a purely inelastic scalar dark matter model, where two real scalars-dark matter $\phi_1$ and its excited partner $\phi_2$ interact with the Standard Model via a Higgs portal. After mass diagonalization, only inelastic couplings remain, allowing the model to evade stringent bounds from direct detection. We show that thermal (co-)annihilation between $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ naturally yields the observed dark matter relic abundance. The same interaction structure can induce a strongly first-order phase transition in the early universe, generating detectable gravitational waves in upcoming experiments. Meanwhile, the slight mass splitting between $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$, along with the heavy off-shell mediator SM Higgs, leads to long-lived particle signatures of $\phi_2$ at the HL-LHC via the displaced muon-jets technique. We pinpoint a feasible parameter space where the correct relic abundance, observable gravitational waves, and collider signals can all be achieved concurrently, presenting a valuable chance to validate this scenario through a comprehensive examination encompassing cosmological, astrophysical, and collider investigations.</p>

<p>2025-08-18, <strong>Search for Light Inelastic Dark Matter with Low-Energy Ionization Signatures in PandaX-4T</strong>, Yu-Chen Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13062v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13062v1</a></p>

<p>Direct detection of light dark matter (DM) is generally difficult due to its small recoil energy. The inelastic scattering of DM can produce unique signatures in the DM direct detection experiments. Using the low-energy unpaired ionization data from PandaX-4T, we newly analyze the probe of the exothermic inelastic dark matter (ineDM). We demonstrate that PandaX-4T can probe the ineDM mass-splitting down to 0.05 keV and probe the ineDM mass to the sub-GeV range. For the ineDM with a dark photon mediator, we use the PandaX-4T data to impose stringent bounds on the mixing parameter between the dark photon and photon.</p>

<p>Accurate estimation of dark matter halo masses for galaxy groups is central to studies of galaxy evolution and for leveraging group catalogues as cosmological probes. We present a calibration and evaluation of two complementary halo mass estimators: a dynamical estimator based on the virial theorem, and an empirical relation between the sum of the stellar masses of the three most massive group galaxies and the halo mass (SHMR). Using state-of-the-art semi-analytic models (SHARK, SAGE, and GAEA) to generate mock light-cone catalogues, we quantify the accuracy, uncertainty, and model dependence of each method. The calibrated virial theorem achieves negligible systematic bias (mean $\Delta$ = -0.01 dex) and low scatter (mean $\sigma$ = 0.20 dex) with no sensitivity to baryonic physics. The calibrated SHMR yields the highest precision (mean $\Delta$ = 0.02 dex, mean $\sigma$ = 0.14 dex) but shows greater model dependence due to sensitivity to baryonic physics across the models. We demonstrate applications to observational catalogues, including the empirical halo mass function and mapping quenched fractions in the stellar mass-halo mass plane. We provide guidance: the virial theorem is recommended for GAMA-like surveys (i &lt; 19.2) at z &lt; 0.1 where minimal model dependence is required, while the SHMR is optimal for high-precision halo mass estimates across diverse catalogues with limits of z &lt; 0.3. These calibrated estimators will aid upcoming wide-area spectroscopic surveys in probing the connection between galaxies and their host dark matter halos.</p>

<p>We investigate the evolution of dark energy using a model-independent framework based on the cosmographic approach. The main objective of this work is to construct a dynamical dark energy model directly from the kinematic equations of the cosmographic parameters, rather than adopting any arbitrary parametrization of the cosmological parameters. We employ the differential equation for the jerk parameter and map it to an anharmonic oscillator equation. From this, we derive an analytical expression for the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy. Interestingly, this form of the EoS depends on only a single parameter. Using the recently released DESI DR2 BAO data, Pantheon+ supernova dataset, and a compressed Planck likelihood, we constrain the cosmological parameters within this framework. Our results indicate a deviation from the cosmological constant behavior at late times, suggesting a dynamical nature of dark energy. Our findings contradict the DESI DR2 analysis based on the CPL parametrization, as no phantom-barrier crossing is observed in our analysis. This study highlights that model-independent reconstructions rooted in kinematical quantities can provide robust insights into the true nature of dark energy.</p>

<p>2025-08-18, <strong>A catalog to unite them all: REGALADE, a revised galaxy compilation for the advanced detector era</strong>, Hugo Tranin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13267v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13267v1</a></p>

<p>Many applications in transient science, gravitational wave follow-up, and galaxy population studies require all-sky galaxy catalogs with reliable distances, extents, and stellar masses. However, existing catalogs often lack completeness beyond $\sim 100$ Mpc, suffer from stellar contamination, or do not provide homogeneous stellar mass estimates and size information. Our goal is to build a high-purity, high-completeness, all-sky galaxy catalog out to 2,000 Mpc, specifically designed to support time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. We combined major galaxy catalogs and deep imaging surveys – including the Legacy Surveys, Pan-STARRS, DELVE, and SDSS – and added spectroscopic, photometric, and redshift-independent distances. We cleaned the sample using the Gaia catalog to remove stars, and visually inspected all ambiguous cases below 100 Mpc through a classification platform that gathered 20,000 expert votes. Stellar masses were estimated using optical and mid-infrared profile-fit photometry, and we improved the accuracy of photometric distances by combining multiple independent estimates. The resulting catalog, REGALADE, includes nearly 80 million galaxies with distances under 2,000 Mpc. It provides stellar masses for 88\% of the sample and ellipse fits for 80\%. REGALADE is more than 90\% complete for massive galaxies out to 360 Mpc. In science tests, it recovers 60\% more known supernova hosts, doubles the number of low-luminosity transient hosts, and identifies more reliable hosts for ultraluminous and hyperluminous X-ray sources. REGALADE is the most complete and reliable all-sky galaxy catalog to date for the nearby Universe, built for real-world applications in transient and multi-messenger astrophysics. The full dataset, visual classifications, and code will be released to support broad community use.</p>

<p>2025-08-18, <strong>The New Status Qvo? SN 2021qvo is Another 2003fg-like Type Ia Supernova with a Rising Light-Curve Bump</strong>, I. A. Abreu Paniagua et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13263v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13263v1</a></p>

<p>In recent years, multiple Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been observed with “bumps” in their rising light curves shortly after explosion. Here, we present SN 2021qvo: a SN Ia that exhibits a clear early bump in photometry obtained by the Young Supernova Experiment. Photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2021qvo show that it has a broader light curve, higher peak luminosity, shallower Si II $\lambda$5972 pseudo-equivalent width, and lower ejecta velocities than normal SNe Ia, which are all consistent with the characteristics of the 2003fg-like (often called “super-Chandrasekhar”) SN subtype. Including SN 2021qvo, just four known 2003fg-like SNe Ia have sufficient pre-peak data to reveal a rising light-curve bump, and all four have bump detections. Host-galaxy analysis reveals that SN 2021qvo exploded in a low-mass galaxy ${\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) = 7.83^{+0.17}_{-0.24}$, also consistent with other members of this class. We investigate the validity of the leading early-bump 2003fg-like SN Ia progenitor model, an interaction between the circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta, by modeling the early bump and subsequent light-curve evolution of SN 2021qvo with the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients. We find that the bump can be modeled with a best-fit CSM mass of $\log_{10}(M_\mathrm{CSM}/M_{\odot}) = -2.33^{+0.26}_{-0.15}$. SN 2021qvo adds to the small but growing number of 2003fg-like SNe Ia with rising light-curve bumps; as the number of these SNe Ia with CSM estimates continues to grow, population-level inferences about the CSM distribution will be able to constrain the progenitor scenario for these SNe Ia.</p>

<p>2025-08-18, <strong>Modified cosmology through generalized mass-to-horizon entropy: observational constraints from DESI DR2 BAO data</strong>, Giuseppe Gaetano Luciano et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13260v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13260v1</a></p>

<p>A generalized mass-to-horizon entropy has recently been proposed as an extension of the Bekenstein-Hawking area law, derived from a modified mass-horizon relation constructed to ensure consistency with the Clausius equation. Within the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, this entropy formulation yields modified Friedmann equations, which recover the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology in the appropriate limit of the model’s two free parameters. In the present study, we constrain this framework using observations from TypeIa supernovae (SNIa), cosmic chronometers (CC) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO, including DESI~DR2), together with the SH0ES distance-ladder prior on $H_0$, across four combinations of data sets. Although the extended entropic scenario yields a slightly better, or statistically comparable, fit to the data, model selection via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) mildly favors the cosmological constant as the dark energy candidate. Moreover, the $\Lambda$CDM limit lies within $\sim 1\sigma$ of our constraints, indicating no significant deviation from standard cosmology with current data.</p>

<p>2025-08-18, <strong>EP250207b is not a collapsar fast X-ray transient. Is it due to a compact object merger?</strong>, P. G. Jonker et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13039v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.13039v1</a></p>

<p>Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are short-lived extra-galactic X-ray sources. Recent progress through multi-wavelength follow-up of Einstein Probe discovered FXTs has shown that several are related to collapsars, which can also produce gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this paper we investigate the nature of the FXT EP250207b. The VLT/MUSE spectra of a nearby (15.9 kpc in projection) lenticular galaxy reveal no signs of recent star formation. If this galaxy is indeed the host, EP250207b lies at a redshift of z=0.082, implying a peak observed absolute magnitude for the optical counterpart of M_r=-14.5. At the time when supernovae (SNe) would peak, it is substantially fainter than all SN types. These results are inconsistent with a collapsar origin for EP250207b. The properties favour a binary compact object merger driven origin. The X-ray, optical and radio observations are compared with predictions of several types of extra-galactic transients, including afterglow and kilonova models. The data can be fit with a slightly off-axis viewing angle afterglow. However, the late-time (~30 day) optical/NIR counterpart is too bright for the afterglow and also for conventional kilonova models. This could be remedied if that late emission is due to a globular cluster or the core of a (tidally disrupted) dwarf galaxy. If confirmed, this would be the first case where the multi-wavelength properties of an FXT are found to be consistent with a compact object merger origin, increasing the parallels between FXTs and GRBs. We finally discuss if the source could originate in a higher redshift host galaxy.</p>

<p>2025-08-18, <strong>Stochasticity in Stellar Yields Reflected in Theoretical Dust Masses Estimates Across all Type II Supernova Progenitors</strong>, Archana Purushothaman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12933v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.12933v1</a></p>

<p>Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are among the primary sources of dust in galaxies. In this study, we derive theoretical upper limits on dust masses as a function of supernova (SN) progenitors with initial masses between 9 and 120 Msun, based on previously established models of dust formation chemistry in CCSNe. We find that O-rich dust, particularly silicates, dominates the dust budget, with masses ranging from 0.02 to 0.9 Msun, and that the total mass of O-rich dust increases with progenitor mass. C-rich amorphous carbon dust is significant for lower-mass progenitors (up to 15 Msun), but its mass never exceeds 0.05 Msun. For progenitors up to 30 Msun, we provide best-fit functions describing the masses of O-rich dust, C-rich dust, and CO molecules. A large stochastic variation is found in the predicted masses of silicate dust, which correlates with the randomness of shell-merger events in the pre-explosion phases of massive stars. Furthermore, we show that the dust mass for a given progenitor can vary by a factor of 2-5, reflecting differences in pre-explosion abundance profiles predicted by the stellar evolution codes KEPLER and MESA. We emphasize that the final dust yield in CCSNe is primarily determined by stochastic stellar yields and uncertainties in pre-explosion nucleosynthesis, while explosion properties mainly influence the timescales of dust formation.</p>

<p>2025-08-18, <strong>Runaway stars and the Galactic supernova remnant landscape: non-thermal emission and observational evidence</strong>, Rowan Batzofin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12721v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.12721v1</a></p>

<p>Context. A significant fraction (~30%) of massive stars in our Galaxy are moving supersonically through the interstellar medium, which strongly governs their location at the time they end their lives, e.g. die as a supernova and give birth to a supernova remnant (SNR). These dead stellar environments accelerate particles, emitting by non-thermal mechanisms up to the TeV range, and they are considered as a major contributor to the very-high-energy band of the local cosmic-ray spectrum.   Aims. This study investigates the effect of the runaway motion of supernova progenitors on the spatial distribution of SNRs in the Milky Way and how this influences the deduced properties of the population.   Methods. We construct Galactic populations of SNRs by Monte Carlo simulation, taking into account the bulk motion and the evolution history of their progenitor stars once ejected from their parent clusters. The gamma-ray domain emission of each population is then calculated, to be compared with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Galactic Plane Survey.   Results. We find that including the runaway motion of supernova progenitors strongly modifies the detectability of the simulated emission of their remnants in the very-high-energy band. Particularly, our best fit model using a Reid Milky Way model for core-collapse supernova progenitors requires 33% of massive runaway stars, which is close to the known fraction of runaway high-mass stars, to be in accordance with the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey data.   Conclusions. Our results show that the runaway nature of supernova progenitors must be taken into account in the study of the Galactic population of SNRs within the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey and the forthcoming Galactic Plane Survey of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, as it is a governing factor of the detectability of non-thermal emission of their subsequent SNRs.</p>

<p>2025-08-18, <strong>The Demographics of Binary Companions to Stripped-Envelope Supernovae: Confronting Observations with Population Synthesis</strong>, E. Zapartas et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12677v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2508.12677v1</a></p>

<p>Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) mark the deaths of massive stars without hydrogen-rich envelopes. Most SESNe likely originate from binary systems where a companion stripped the progenitor of its envelope. Years of HST imaging of nearby SESNe sites have produced a statistically meaningful sample of constraints on surviving binary companions. We assemble the current sample of six companion detections and six non-detections from the literature, re-analyzing whenever needed. We then conduct the first statistical comparison with binary population-synthesis predictions, primarily based on new calculations performed with the POSYDON framework. Across a metallicity range, our models predict that 80-90% of Type Ib/c and 60-85% of IIb SNe explode with a rapidly rotating, main-sequence companion. The observed luminosity distribution favors fairly inefficient mass accretion and failed explosions of the most massive stripped stars. The companion detection fraction broadly matches predictions, given the imaging depth, but appears elevated for Type IIb SNe. In all but one non-detection, a faint, undetected companion is the most likely scenario. The red, apparently evolved companions in a few Type Ib/c SNe may result from strong interaction with the ejecta, expected in $\sim$12% of them. Companion demographics offer a powerful, independent probe of SESN progenitor systems, with the current sample disfavoring efficient accretion and supporting Wolf-Rayet non-explodability. Larger companion samples and follow-up studies will further clarify binary pathways to SESNe, serving as benchmarks for transient surveys.</p>
