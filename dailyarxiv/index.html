<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Gas Electroluminescence in a Dual Phase Xenon-Doped Argon Detector</strong>, James W. Kingston et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02261v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.02261v1</a></p>

<p>Noble element detectors using argon or xenon as the detection medium are widely used in the searches for rare neutrino and dark matter interactions. Xenon doping in liquid argon can preserve attractive properties of an argon target while enhancing the detectable signals with properties of xenon. In this work, we deployed a dual-phase liquid argon detector with up to 4% xenon doping in the liquid and studied its gas electroluminescence properties as a function of xenon concentration. At $\sim$2% xenon doping in liquid argon, we measured $\sim$34 ppm of xenon in the gas and observed $\sim$2.5 times larger electroluminescence signals in the detector than those in pure argon. By analyzing signals recorded by photosensors of different wavelength sensitivities, we confirm that the argon gas electroluminescence process is strongly affected by the addition of xenon. We propose an analytical model to describe the underlying energy transfer mechanism in argon-xenon gas mixtures. Lastly, the implications of this measurement for low energy ionization signal detection will be discussed.</p>

<p>Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers (TPCs) are widely used in searches for rare dark matter and neutrino interactions, in part because of their excellent position reconstruction capability in 3D. Despite their millimeter-scale resolution along the charge drift axis, xenon TPCs face challenges in resolving single-site (SS) and multi-site (MS) interactions in the transverse plane. In this paper, we build a generic TPC model with an idealized light-based signal readout, and use Fisher Information (FI) to study its theoretical capability of differentiating SS and MS events. We also demonstrate via simulation that this limit can be approached with conventional reconstruction algorithms like maximum likelihood estimation, and with a convolutional neural network classifier. The implications of this study on future TPC experiments will be discussed.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter with a refined numerical scheme</strong>, Kentaro Kasai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01907v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01907v1</a></p>

<p>The existence of a large primordial neutrino asymmetry is an intriguing possibility, both observationally and theoretically. Such an asymmetry can lead to the resonant production of $\mathrm{keV}$-scale sterile neutrinos, which are a fascinating candidate for dark matter. In this paper, we comprehensively revisit the resonant production processes with a refined numerical analysis, adopting a dynamical discretization of momentum modes to take care of the sharpness of the resonance. We find parameter regions consistent with X-ray and Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints for lepton-to-entropy ratio $\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ and $m_{\nu_s}\gtrsim 20$\,keV. We also explore the Affleck-Dine mechanism as a possible origin for such asymmetries. While previous studies considered resonant production after lepton number generation, we numerically investigate cases where a fraction of sterile neutrinos is produced during lepton number injection. In this regime, some parameter sets can shorten the free-streaming length and reduce the required mixing angle to match the observed dark matter abundance, thereby mitigating the observational constraints.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Reducing Simulation Dependence in Neutrino Telescopes with Masked Point Transformers</strong>, Felix J. Yu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01733v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01733v1</a></p>

<p>Machine learning techniques in neutrino physics have traditionally relied on simulated data, which provides access to ground-truth labels. However, the accuracy of these simulations and the discrepancies between simulated and real data remain significant concerns, particularly for large-scale neutrino telescopes that operate in complex natural media. In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for reducing dependence on labeled datasets. Here, we present the first self-supervised training pipeline for neutrino telescopes, leveraging point cloud transformers and masked autoencoders. By shifting the majority of training to real data, this approach minimizes reliance on simulations, thereby mitigating associated systematic uncertainties. This represents a fundamental departure from previous machine learning applications in neutrino telescopes, paving the way for substantial improvements in event reconstruction and classification.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>GUT-motivated non-invertible symmetry as a solution to the strong CP problem and the neutrino CP-violating phase</strong>, Tatsuo Kobayashi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01680v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01680v1</a></p>

<p>The unsuppressed CP violation in QCD is a problem in the standard model. If we have some mechanism to guarantee real determinants of the quark mass matrices, the vanishing physical vacuum angle $\bar \theta$ indicates the CP invariance at the fundamental level. Thus, the small ${\bar \theta}$ is technically natural, since we have an enhanced CP symmetry in the limit of the vanishing $\bar \theta =0$. In fact, it was proved that the vacuum angle is never renormalized up to the four-loop level once it is fixed at 0 value at some high energy scale. The purpose of this paper is to construct a model which guarantees the real determinants of the quark mass matrices assuming a non-invertible symmetry.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Dedicated-frequency analysis of gravitational-wave bursts from core-collapse supernovae with minimal assumptions</strong>, Yi Shuen C. Lee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01614v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01614v1</a></p>

<p>Gravitational-wave (GW) emissions from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) provide insights into the internal processes leading up to their explosions. Theory predicts that CCSN explosions are driven by hydrodynamical instabilities like the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or neutrino-driven convection, and simulations show that these mechanisms emit GWs at low frequencies ($\lesssim 0.25 \,{\rm kHz}$). Thus the detection of low-frequency GWs, or lack thereof, is useful for constraining explosion mechanisms in CCSNe. This paper introduces the dedicated-frequency framework, which is designed to follow-up GW burst detections using bandpass analyses. The primary aim is to study whether low-frequency (LF) follow-up analyses, limited to $\leq 256 \,{\rm Hz}$, constrain CCSN explosion models in practical observing scenarios. The analysis dataset comprises waveforms from five CCSN models with different strengths of low-frequency GW emissions induced by SASI and/or neutrino-driven convection, injected into the Advanced LIGO data from the Third Observing Run (O3). Eligible candidates for the LF follow-up must satisfy a benchmark detection significance and are identified using the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) algorithm. The LF follow-up analyses are performed using the BayesWave algorithm. Both cWB and BayesWave make minimal assumptions about the signal’s morphology. The results suggest that the successful detection of a CCSN in the LF follow-up analysis constrains its explosion mechanism. The dedicated-frequency framework also has other applications. As a demonstration, the loudest trigger from the SN 2019fcn supernova search is followed-up using a high-frequency (HF) analysis, limited to $\geq 256 \,{\rm Hz}$. The trigger has negligible power below $256 \, {\rm Hz}$, and the HF analysis successfully enhances its detection significance.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Astrophysical Consequences of an Electroweak $\etaw$ Pseudo-Scalar</strong>, Hooman Davoudiasl et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02310v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.02310v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, it has been suggested that the spectrum of physical states in the Standard Model may include an ultralight pseudo-scalar, denoted by $\eta_w$, in analogy with the $\eta’$ state arising from the strong interactions. We find that typical expectations for the properties of $\eta_w$ get challenged by astrophysical constraints on the couplings of ultralight bosons. Our strongest limit sets a lower bound of O(1000 TeV) on the decay constant of the hypothesized pseudo-scalar. We also briefly discuss whether $\eta_w$ could be a dark matter candidate, or the origin of dark energy, but conclude that those identifications appear unlikely. Given the important implications of a potentially overlooked $\eta_w$ state for a more complete understanding of the electroweak interactions and a fundamental description of Nature, further theoretical and phenomenological investigations of this possibility and its associated physics are warranted.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Measurement of Dark Matter Substructure from the Kinematics of the GD-1 Stellar Stream</strong>, Jacob Nibauer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02247v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.02247v1</a></p>

<p>Stellar streams are sensitive tracers of low-mass dark matter subhalos and provide a means to test the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm on small scales. In this work, we connect the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the GD-1 stream to the number density and internal structure of dark matter subhalos in the mass range $10^5$-$10^9\ M_\odot$. We measure the radial velocity dispersion of GD-1 based on 160 identified member stars across four different spectroscopic catalogs. We use repeat observations of the same stars to constrain binarity. We find that the stream’s intrinsic radial velocity dispersion ranges from approximately 2-5 km/s across its length. The region of GD-1 with the highest velocity dispersion represents a $4\sigma$ deviation from unperturbed stream models formed in a smooth Milky Way potential, which are substantially colder. We use perturbation theory to model the stream’s velocity dispersion as a function of dark matter subhalo population parameters, including the number of low-mass subhalos in the Milky Way, the dark matter half-mode mass, and the mass-concentration relation of subhalos. We find that the observed velocity dispersion can be explained by numerous impacts with low-mass dark matter subhalos, or by a single impact with a very compact subhalo with $M \gtrsim 10^8\ M_\odot$. Our constraint on the fraction of mass in subhalos is $f_{\mathrm{sub}} = 0.05^{+0.08}_{-0.03}$ (68\% confidence). In both scenarios, our model prefers subhalos that are more compact compared to CDM mass-size expectations. These results suggest a possible deviation from CDM at low subhalo masses, which may be accounted for by dark matter self-interactions that predict higher concentrations in lower-mass subhalos.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Wasserstein normalized autoencoder for anomaly detection</strong>, CMS Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02168v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.02168v1</a></p>

<p>A novel anomaly detection algorithm is presented. The Wasserstein normalized autoencoder (WNAE) is a normalized probabilistic model that minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the learned probability distribution – a Boltzmann distribution where the energy is the reconstruction error of the autoencoder – and the distribution of the training data. This algorithm has been developed and applied to the identification of semivisible jets – conical sprays of visible standard model particles and invisible dark matter states – with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. Trained on jets of particles from simulated standard model processes, the WNAE is shown to learn the probability distribution of the input data in a fully unsupervised fashion, such that it effectively identifies new physics jets as anomalies. The model consistently demonstrates stable, convergent training and achieves strong classification performance across a wide range of signals, improving upon standard normalized autoencoders, while remaining agnostic to the signal. The WNAE directly tackles the problem of outlier reconstruction, a common failure mode of autoencoders in anomaly detection tasks.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>In-situ globular clusters in alternative dark matter Milky Way galaxies: a first approach to fuzzy and core-like dark matter theories</strong>, Pierre Boldrini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02130v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.02130v1</a></p>

<p>We present a first analysis of the dynamics of in-situ globular clusters (GCs) in Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies embedded in fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos, combining cosmological assembly histories from the TNG50 simulation with dedicated orbital integrations and analytical models. GC populations are initialized with identical distributions in normalized $E$-$L_{z}$ in matched CDM and FDM halos. In a universe dominated by FDM, we identify three distinct regimes for the in-situ GC population depending on the particle mass $m_{22} \equiv m_{\chi}/ 10^{-22}~\mathrm{eV}$. For $m_{22} &lt; 7$, baryons dominate the inner potential, which remains steep and centrally concentrated, confining GC orbits to a narrow region and producing less massive, more compact systems than in CDM. For $m_{22} \sim 7$, GC properties resemble those in CDM, with similar mass and spatial distributions. For $m_{22} &gt; 7$, the dark matter becomes both compact and globally dominant, generating a deeper and more extended gravitational potential that supports a wider range of stable GC orbits, resulting in more massive and spatially extended GC systems. Finally, we extend our framework to make predictions for GC populations in alternative DM models, including warm dark matter and self-interacting dark matter, in both MW-like and dwarf galaxies. Our findings demonstrate that in-situ GC systems offer a sensitive and independent probe of the underlying DM physics, opening new avenues for observational constraints with upcoming Euclid.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Constraints on WIMP-like dark matter scattering on electrons with COSINE-100</strong>, N. Carlin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01927v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01927v1</a></p>

<p>We present results of the search for WIMP-like dark matter interaction with electrons in the NaI(Tl) crystals of the COSINE-100 experiment. The two benchmark scenarios of a heavy and a light vector boson as mediator of the interaction were studied. We found no excess events over the expected background in a data-set of 2.82 yr, with a total exposure of 172.9 kg.yr. The derived 90% confidence level upper limits exclude a WIMP-electron scattering cross section above 6.4 $\times$ 10$^{-33}$ cm$^2$ for a WIMP mass of 0.25 GeV, assuming a light mediator; and above 3.4 $\times$ 10$^{-37}$ cm$^2$ for a 0.4 GeV WIMP, assuming a heavy mediator, and represent the most stringent constraints for a NaI(Tl) target to date. We also briefly discuss a planned analysis using an annual modulation method below the current 0.7 keV threshold of COSINE-100, down to few photoelectrons yield.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Dark characterization of Ti/Al LEKIDs for the search of axions in the W-band</strong>, Victor Rollano et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01913v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01913v1</a></p>

<p>We report the electrical (dark) characterization of lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs) fabricated from a Titanium/Aluminum bilayer and designed for broadband absorption in the W-band (75-110 GHz). These detectors are prototypes for future QCD axion search experiments within the Canfranc Axion Detection Experiment (CADEx), which demand sub 1e-19 W/Hz^0.5 sensitivities under low optical backgrounds. We combine a Mattis-Bardeen analysis to the temperature dependence of the detector parameters with noise spectroscopy to determine the electrical noise equivalent power (NEP). The minimum measured value for the electrical NEP is 3e-19 W/Hz0.5. Across the measured temperature range, we find that quasiparticle lifetime deviates from the expected BCS recombination law. Our analysis suggests that non-equilibrium relaxation is governed by spatial inhomogeneities in the superconducting gap and phonon diffusion effects. This work sets the road-map to achieve suitable and ultra-sensitive detectors in the W-band for dark matter axion search experiments.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Background Suppression in Quantum Sensing of Dark Matter via $W$ State Projection</strong>, Shion Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01816v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01816v1</a></p>

<p>We show that measuring dark matter signal by projecting quantum sensors in the collective excited state can highly suppress the non-collective noise background, hence improving the sensitivity significantly. We trace the evolution of the sensors’ state in the presence of both dark matter effect and sensors’ decoherence effects, optimizing the protocol execution time, and show that the suppression of background by a factor equal to the number of sensors is possible. This method does not require the entanglement of sensors during the signal accumulation time, hence circumventing the difficulty of maintaining the lifetime of the entangled state that is present in other enhancement proposals. This protocol is also general regarding the type of qubit sensors.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Noisy Timing Behavior is a Feature of Central Compact Object Pulsars</strong>, K. I. Perez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02233v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.02233v1</a></p>

<p>We present a timing study of the three known central compact object (CCO) pulsars, isolated cooling neutron stars in supernova remnants, using Chandra, XMM-Newton and NICER observations spanning two decades. Relative to canonical young pulsars, CCOs are spinning down at a very slow rate $|\dot f| &lt;10^{-15}$ s$^{-2}$, implying a surface dipole magnetic field strength $B_s &lt; 10^{11}$ G that is too weak to account for their X-ray emitting hot spots. Two CCO pulsars with sufficiently long monitoring, 1E 1207.4$-$5209 and PSR J0821$-$4300, are seen to deviate from steady spin-down; their timing residuals can be modeled by one or more glitches in $f$ and $\dot f$, or alternatively by extreme timing noise. For the third CCO pulsar, PSR J1852+0400, the sparse temporal coverage was insufficient to detect such effects. Glitch activity and timing noise in large samples of rotation-powered pulsars correlate best with $\dot f$, while the timing irregularities of the first two CCOs are extreme compared to pulsars of the same $\dot f$. Nevertheless, timing activity in CCOs may arise from properties that they share with other young but more energetic pulsars: high internal temperature, strong buried magnetic field and superfluid behavior. Alternatively, continuing low-level accretion of supernova debris is not ruled out as a source of timing noise in CCOs.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Jittering jets in stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae</strong>, Nikki Yat Ning Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02203v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.02203v1</a></p>

<p>Using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code MESA, we find that all our models in the initial mass range of 12-40 Mo, regardless of whether they have hydrogen-rich, hydrogen-stripped, or helium+hydrogen-stripped envelopes, have at least one significant strong convective zone in the inner core, which can facilitate the jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We focus on stripped-envelope CCSN progenitors that earlier studies of the JJEM did not study, and examine the angular momentum parameter j=rVconv, where r is the radius of the layer and Vconv is the convective velocity according to the mixing length theory. In all models, there is at least one prominent convective zone with j&gt;2e15 cm^2/s inside the mass coordinate that is the maximum baryonic mass of a neutron star (NS), m=2.65 Mo. According to the JJEM, convection in these zones seeds instabilities above the newly born NS, leading to the formation of intermittent accretion disks that launch pairs of jittering jets, which in turn explode the star. Our finding is encouraging for the JJEM, although it does not show that the intermittent accretion disks indeed form. We strengthen the claim that, according to the JJEM, there are no failed CCSNe and that all massive stars explode. In demonstrating the robust convection in the inner core of stripped-envelope CCSN progenitors, we add to the establishment of the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</p>

<p>The supernova remnant (SNR) S147 contains the pulsar PSR J0538+2817 and a likely unbound binary companion, HD 37424. It is the only good Galactic candidate for a binary unbound by a core-collapse supernova (SN). Using Gaia DR3 parallaxes and photometry, we select the stars local to SNR S147 in a cylinder with a projected radius of $100$ pc and a parallax range of $0.614 &lt; \varpi &lt; 0.787$ mas (a length of $\simeq 360$ pc). We individually model the most luminous of these stars. The two most luminous single stars are the unbound binary companion, HD 37424, and HD 37367, with estimated masses of $(13.51\pm0.05) M_{\odot}$ and $(14.30\pm0.09) M_{\odot}$, respectively. The two most luminous binary systems are the spectroscopic binary HD 37366 and the eclipsing binary ET Tau that have primary masses of $(20.9\pm0.12) M_{\odot}$ and $(16.7\pm0.09) M_{\odot}$, respectively. We model the Gaia color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of this local stellar population using both single stars and a model consisting of noninteracting binaries using Solar metallicity PARSEC isochrones. For both models, the estimated age distributions of the $439$ $M_{G} &lt; 0$ mag stars favor a high mass progenitor of $21.5M_{\odot}-41.1M_{\odot}$ for the SN.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>BAO miscalibration cannot rescue late-time solutions to the Hubble tension</strong>, Davide Pedrotti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01974v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01974v1</a></p>

<p>Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements play a key role in ruling out post-recombination solutions to the Hubble tension. However, because the data compression leading to these measurements assumes a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, their reliability in testing late-time modifications to $\Lambda$CDM has at times been called into question. We play devil’s advocate and posit that fiducial cosmology assumptions do indeed affect BAO measurements in such a way that low-redshift acoustic angular scales (proportional to the Hubble constant $H_0$) are biased low, and test whether such a rescaling can rescue post-recombination solutions. The answer is no. Firstly, strong constraints on the shape of the $z \lesssim 2$ expansion history from unanchored Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) prevent large deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. In addition, unless $\Omega_m$ is significantly lower than $0.3$, the rescaled BAO measurements would be in strong tension with geometrical information from the Cosmic Microwave Background. We demonstrate this explicitly on several dark energy (DE) models ($w$CDM, CPL DE, phenomenologically emergent DE, holographic DE, $\Lambda_s$CDM, and the negative cosmological constant model), finding that none can address the Hubble tension once unanchored SNeIa are included. We argue that the $\Lambda_s$CDM sign-switching cosmological constant model possesses interesting features which make it the least unpromising one among those tested. Our results demonstrate that possible fiducial cosmology-induced BAO biases cannot be invoked as loopholes to the Hubble tension “no-go theorem”, and highlight the extremely important but so far underappreciated role of unanchored SNeIa in ruling out post-recombination solutions.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Orbital Period Changes of Recurrent Nova U Scorpii Demonstrate that M$<em>{\rm ejecta}$=26$\times$M$</em>{\rm accreted}$ and Is Not a Type Ia Supernova Progenitor</strong>, Bradley E. Schaefer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01589v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01589v1</a></p>

<p>Recurrent nova U Scorpii (U Sco) is one of the prototypes for a Type Ia supernova progenitor. The logic is that the white dwarf is near the Chandrasekhar mass and gas is accumulating onto its surface at a near-maximal accretion rate, so it will soon increase its mass to the supernova trigger. But the white dwarf loses mass every nova eruption, so the issue is balancing the mass ejected ($M_{\rm ejecta}$) against the mass accreted between eruptions ($M_{\rm accreted}$). Measuring $M_{\rm accreted}$ can be done in several ways to useable accuracy. But the old methods for measuring $M_{\rm ejecta}$ (involving the flux in hydrogen emission lines) are all with real error bars of 2–3 orders of magnitude. The only solution is to measure the change of the orbital period across the nova eruption ($\Delta P$). But this solution requires a vast photometric program of eclipse timings stretching decades. For U Sco, a program started in 1989, now reaches its culmination with measures of $\Delta P$ for the eruptions of 1999, 2010, 2016, and 2022. This paper reports on 52 new eclipse times (for a total of 218 eclipses 1945–2025), plus a new theory result allowing for the confident calculation of $M_{\rm ejecta}$ from $\Delta P$. The four eruptions ejected a total of (103$\pm$14)$\times\(10^{-6}$ $M\_{\odot}$, while the white dwarf accreted 4$\times\)10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$ over the four previous eruption cycles. With M$_{\rm ejecta}$=26$\times$M$_{\rm accreted}$, the U Sco white dwarf is losing large masses each eruption cycle, so U Sco can never produce a Type Ia supernova.</p>

<p>2025-10-02, <strong>Orbital Period Changes in Recurrent Nova T Corona Borealis Prove That It Is Not a Type Ia Supernovae Progenitor</strong>, Bradley E. Schaefer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01587v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.01587v1</a></p>

<p>T Corona Borealis (T CrB) is a recurrent nova and a symbiotic star that is commonly highlighted as the best case for being a progenitor of a Type Ia supernova (SNIa) within the framework of single-degenerate models. This exemplar can be tested by measuring whether the white dwarf (WD) mass ($M_{\rm WD}$) is increasing over each eruption cycle. This is a balance between the mass ejected during each nova event ($M_{\rm ejecta}$) and the mass accreted onto the WD between the nova events ($M_{\rm accreted}$). I have used all 206 radial velocities from 1946–2024 to measure the orbital period just after the 1946 eruption to be $P_{\rm post}$=227.6043 days, while the steady orbital period change ($\dot{P}$) is ($-$3.1$\pm$1.6)$\times$10$^{-6}$. I have used my full 213,730 magnitude $B$ and $V$ light curve from 1842–2025 to measure the times of maximum brightness in the ellipsoidal modulations to construct the $O-C$ from 1866–1946. I fit the broken parabola shape, to find the orbital period immediately before the 1946 eruption to be $P_{\rm pre}$=227.4586 days. The orbital period changed by $\Delta P$=$+$0.146$\pm$0.019 days. With Kepler’s Law, conservation of angular momentum, and the well-measured binary properties, the ejecta mass in 1946 is 0.00074$\pm$0.00009 M$_{\odot}$. $M_{\rm accreted}$ is reliably measured to be 1.38$\times$10$^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$ from the accretion luminosity. $M_{\rm ejecta}$ is larger than $M_{\rm accreted}$ by 540$\times$, so $M_{\rm WD}$ is {\it decreasing} every eruption cycle. T CrB can never become a SNIa.</p>
