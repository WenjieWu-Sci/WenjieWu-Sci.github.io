<p>2024-08-15, <strong>Hydrostatic equilibrium of X-ray gas in HMG: four representative cases</strong>, Robert Monjo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08102v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.08102v1</a></p>

<p>Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) was originally proposed to model galaxy rotation curves without dark matter. However, MOND presents difficulties in explaining the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) observed in galaxy clusters, and moreover, it does not completely eliminate the need for dark matter, since it requires using sterile neutrinos to explain the observed hydrostatic equilibrium of the hot gas. Hyperconical Modified Gravity (HMG) offers a relativistic framework that recovers the success of MOND in galaxy rotation curves as a natural particular case, and it could potentially reconcile the above discrepancies without invoking any type of dark matter. This Letter analyses the performance of the HMG model for hydrostatic equilibrium in four representative systems: groups of NGC 533 and NGC 5044 galaxies, and clusters of Abell 2717 and Abell 2029. Specifically, we used high-resolution X-ray data with which gas density, temperature, and mass profiles were previously derived to constrain modified gravity models. Our results show that the hydrostatic equilibrium in the four systems is naturally adjusted to the HMG model without the need for fitting parameters or adding sterile neutrinos, which are required for MOND theories.</p>

<p>Frequentist parameter inference using profile likelihoods has received increased attention in the cosmology literature recently since it can give important complementary information to Bayesian credible intervals. Here, we give a pedagogical review to frequentist parameter inference in cosmology with particular focus on when the graphical profile likelihood construction gives meaningful constraints, i.e.\ confidence intervals with correct coverage. This construction rests on the assumption of the asymptotic limit of a large data set such as in \textit{Wilks’ theorem}. We assess the validity of this assumption in the context of three cosmological models with \textit{Planck} 2018 \texttt{Plik\_lite} data: While our tests for the $\Lambda$CDM model indicate that the profile likelihood method gives correct coverage, $\Lambda$CDM with the sum of neutrino masses as a free parameter appears consistent with a Gaussian near a boundary motivating the use of the boundary-corrected or Feldman-Cousins graphical method; for $w_0$CDM with the equation of state of dark energy, $w_0$, as a free parameter, we find indication of a violation of the assumptions. Finally, we compare frequentist and Bayesian constraints of these models. Our results motivate care when using the graphical profile likelihood method in cosmology.</p>

<p>2024-08-14, <strong>Exploring New Physics with PandaX-4T Low Energy Electronic Recoil Data</strong>, PandaX Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07641v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.07641v1</a></p>

<p>New particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, such as axions, can be effectively searched through their interactions with electrons. We use the large liquid xenon detector PandaX-4T to search for novel electronic recoil signals induced by solar axions, neutrinos with anomalous magnetic moment, axion-like particles, dark photons, and light fermionic dark matter. A detailed background model is established with the latest datasets with 1.54 $\rm tonne \cdot year$ exposure. No significant excess above the background has been observed, and we have obtained competitive constraints for axion couplings, neutrino magnetic moment, and fermionic dark matter interactions.</p>

<p>2024-08-14, <strong>TeV scale Leptogenesis with triplet Fermion in Connection to Muon $g-2$ and W mass anomaly</strong>, Simran Arora et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07598v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.07598v1</a></p>

<p>We propose extending the minimal scotogenic model with a triplet fermion and a singlet scalar. All the fields change non-trivially under an additional $Z_{4}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry. The $Z_{4}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry allows only diagonal Yukawa couplings among different generations of SM leptons and right-handed singlet neutrinos. The one-loop radiative diagrams generate neutrino mass. The Yukawa coupling of the triplet fermion with the inert doublet positively contributes to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The imposed $Z_{4}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry forbids the conventional leptogenesis from the right-handed neutrino decay. A net lepton asymmetry can be generated in the muonic sector from triplet fermion decay. Involvement of the Yukawa coupling both in leptogenesis and in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon results in a strong correlation between leptogenesis and the recent Fermi lab result. We show a viable parameter space for TeV scale leptogenesis while explaining the Fermi lab results. The inert scalar is the dark matter candidate in this model. The model also poses the potential to explain the latest results on W boson mass from the CDF-II experiment.</p>

<p>2024-08-15, <strong>Photon Frequency Conversion in High-$Q$ Superconducting Resonators: Axion Electrodynamics, QED &amp; Nonlinear Meissner Radiation</strong>, Hikaru Ueki et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08275v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.08275v1</a></p>

<p>High-Q superconducting resonators have been proposed and developed as detectors of light-by-light scattering mediated by the hypothesized axion or virtual electron-positron pairs in quantum electrodynamics - the Euler-Heisenberg (EH) interaction. Photon frequency and mode conversion is central to the scheme for detecting such rare events. Superconducting resonators are nonlinear devices. The Meissner screening currents that confine the electromagnetic fields to the vacuum region of a superconducting RF cavity are nonlinear functions of the EM field at the vacuum-superconducting interface, and as a result can generate source currents and frequency conversion of microwave photons in the cavity. In this report we consider photon frequency and mode conversion in superconducting resonators with high quality factors from Meissner currents in single and dual cavity setups proposed for axion and QED searches based on light-by-light scattering. In a single cavity with two pump modes photon frequency conversion by the Meissner screening current dominates photon generation by the EH interaction for cavities with $Q \lesssim 10^{12}$. The Meissner currents also generate background photons that limits the operation of the resonator for axion detection in three-mode, single cavity setups. We also consider the leakage of photons from pump modes into the signal mode for both axion and EH mediated light-by-light scattering. Photon frequency conversion by the EH interaction can compete with Meissner and leakage radiation in \emph{ultra-high-Q} cavities that are beyond current state of the art. Meissner radiation and leakage backgrounds can be suppressed in dual cavity setups with appropriate choices for pump and spectator modes, as well as the single-cavity setup proposed for heterodyne detection of galactic axion dark matter.</p>

<p>2024-08-15, <strong>Constraining Ultralight ALP Dark Matter in Light of Cosmic Birefringence</strong>, Dongdong Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08063v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.08063v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmic birefringence, the observed rotation of the polarization plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), serves as a compelling probe for parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model. This study explores the potential of ultralight axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter to explain the observed cosmic birefringence in the CMB. We focus on the previously understudied mass range of $10^{-25}$ eV to $10^{-23}$ eV, where ALPs start to undergo nonlinear clustering in the late universe. Our analysis incorporates recent cosmological constraints and considers the washout effect on CMB polarization. We find that for models with ALP masses $10^{-25}$ eV $\lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-23}$ eV and birefringence arising from late ALP clustering, the upper limit on the ALP-photon coupling constant, imposed by the washout effect, is stringently lower than the coupling required to account for the observed static cosmic birefringence signal. This discrepancy persists regardless of the ALP fraction in dark matter. Furthermore, considering ALPs with masses $m_\phi\gtrsim$ $10^{-23}$ eV cannot explain static birefringence due to their rapid field oscillations, our results indicate that, all ALP dark matter candidates capable of nonlinear clustering in the late universe and thus contributing mainly to the rotation angle of polarized photons, are incompatible with explaining the static cosmic birefringence signal observed in Planck and WMAP data.</p>

<p>2024-08-15, <strong>Combined search in dwarf spheroidal galaxies for branon dark matter annihilation signatures with the MAGIC telescopes</strong>, MAGIC Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08009v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.08009v1</a></p>

<p>Massive brane fluctuations, called branons, behave as weakly interacting massive particles, which is one of the most favored class of candidates to fulfill the role of the dark matter (DM), an elusive kind of matter beyond the Standard Model. We present a multi-target search in dwarf spheroidal galaxies for branon DM annihilation signatures with a total exposure of 354 hours with the ground-based gamma-ray telescope system MAGIC. This search led to the most constraining limits on branon DM in the sub-TeV and multi-TeV DM mass range. Our most stringent limit on the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section (at $95\%$ confidence level) corresponds to $ \langle \sigma v \rangle \simeq 1.9 \times 10^{-24}{\text{cm}^{3}\text{s}^{-1}} $ at a branon mass of $ \sim 1.5~\text{TeV}$.</p>

<p>2024-08-14, <strong>Sub-MeV Dark Sink Dark Matter</strong>, Prudhvi N. Bhattiprolu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07744v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.07744v1</a></p>

<p>A Dark Sink uses dark-sector interactions to siphon energy from dark matter to lighter dark degrees of freedom, i.e. dark radiation. Here, we extend dark matter models containing a Dark Sink to sub-MeV masses. We consider a Dark Sink model where the dark matter is charged under a light dark photon that has kinetic mixing with the Standard Model. For sub-MeV dark matter masses, plasmon decays are the dominant mechanism for transferring energy to the dark sector. Relative to a standard freeze-in cosmology, reproducing the observed dark matter density in a Dark Sink structure requires an increase in the dark matter couplings to the Standard Model, and hence increased direct detection cross sections. These models provide benchmarks for current and upcoming direct detection experiments. Accounting for plasmon effects, we derive the range of possible dark matter masses and cross sections for Dark Sink models in the sub-MeV regime. We make code available to reproduce our benchmarks; it may be of use for other freeze-in scenarios, including those where plasmon decays to the dark matter are important.</p>

<p>2024-08-14, <strong>Constraining light QCD axions with isolated neutron star cooling</strong>, Antonio Gómez-Bañón et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07740v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.07740v1</a></p>

<p>The existence of lighter-than-expected QCD axions can lead to a new ground state of matter, where the sourced axion field reduces the nucleon effective mass. The presence of the axion field has structural consequences, in particular, it results in a thinner (or even prevents its existence) heat-blanketing envelope, significantly altering the cooling patterns of neutron stars. We exploit the anomalous cooling behavior to constrain previously uncharted regions of the axion parameter space by comparing model predictions with existing data from isolated neutron stars. Notably, this analysis does not require the lighter-than-expected QCD axion to be the dark matter candidate.</p>

<p>2024-08-14, <strong>Possible wormholes in $f(R)$ gravity sourced by solitonic quantum wave and cold dark matter halos and their repulsive gravity effect</strong>, Abdelghani Errehymy et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07667v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.07667v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we present new generalized wormhole (WH) solutions within the context of $f(R)$ gravity. Specifically, we focus on $f(R)$ gravitational theories formulated in the metric formalism, with our investigation centered on a power-law form represented by $f(R) = \epsilon R^{\chi}$. Here, $\epsilon$ is an arbitrary constant, and $\chi$ is a real number. Notably, this form possesses the advantageous property of reducing to Einstein gravity when $\epsilon=1$ and $\chi=1$. To obtain these novel WH solutions, we establish the general field equations for any $f(R)$ theory within the framework of Morris-Thorne spacetime, assuming metric coefficients that are independent of time. By utilizing an anisotropic matter source and a specific type of energy density associated with solitonic quantum wave (SQW) and cold dark matter (CDM) halos, we calculate two distinct WH solutions. We thoroughly investigate the properties of the exotic matter (ExoM) residing within the WH geometry and analyze the matter contents through energy conditions (ECs). Both analytical and graphical methods are employed in this analysis to examine the validity of different regions. Notably, the calculated shape functions for the WH geometry satisfy the necessary conditions in both scenarios, emphasizing their reliability. This ExoM is characterized by an energy-momentum tensor that violates the null energy condition (NEC) and, consequently, the weak energy condition as well, in the vicinity of the WH throats. Furthermore, we investigated the repulsive effect of gravity and discovered that its presence results in a negative deflection angle for photons following null geodesics. Importantly, we observed that the deflection angle consistently exhibits negative values across all $r_0$ values in both scenarios, indicating the manifestation of the repulsive gravity effect.</p>

<p>This set of notes was designed to accompany two hours of lectures and practical exercises at the New Horizons for Psi workshop in Lisbon in July 2024 entitled “Studying fundamental fields with numerical relativity”. Numerical relativity is a tool used to help understand the behaviours of metric and matter fields in dynamical, strong gravity situations. It has been used to study a range of situations involving fundamental fields, including superradiance, modified gravity, dynamical friction, dark matter accretion and early universe cosmology. The purpose of this course is to provide some background and hands-on experience in numerical relativity that will help students to better understand the possibilities provided by this tool, as well as its limitations.</p>

<p>2024-08-14, <strong>Ellipticities of Galaxy Cluster Halos from Halo-Shear-Shear Correlations</strong>, Zhenjie Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07373v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.07373v1</a></p>

<p>We report the first detection of the halo ellipticities of galaxy clusters by applying the halo-shear-shear correlations (HSSC), without the necessity of major axis determination. We use the Fourier\_Quad shear catalog based on the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey and the group catalog from the DESI Legacy Surveys for the measurement of group/cluster lensing and HSSC. Our analysis includes the off-centering effects. We obtain the average projected ellipticity of dark matter halos with mass $13.5 &lt; {\rm log} (M_G h/ M_\odot) &lt; 14.5$ within 1.3 virial radius to be $0.48^{+0.12}_{-0.19}$. We divide the sample into two groups based on mass and redshift, and we find that halos with higher mass tend to exhibit increased ellipticity. We also reveal that high-richness halos have larger ellipticities, confirming the physical picture from numerical simulation that high-richiness halos have a dynamical youth and more active mass accretion phase.</p>

<p>2024-08-14, <strong>Polarization Measurements as a Probe of Axion-Photon Coupling: a Study of GRB 221009A</strong>, Boris Betancourt Kamenetskaia et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07352v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.07352v1</a></p>

<p>Axion Like Particles (ALPs) can be produced in Gamma Ray Bursts, altering the polarization of the electromagnetic emission in these events. For the first time, we derive bounds on the axion-photon coupling from polarization measurements of GRB 221009A, performing a full calculation of the Stokes parameters, as it is typically done in the astrophysics community. Within astrophysical uncertainties, our limits on the axion-photon coupling are competitive with complementary probes in the axion mass range $10^{-9}$ eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-8}$ eV, further allowing to probe motivated parameter space of ALP dark matter.</p>

<p>Until now it has not been possible to obtain the proper motions of PSR B1849+00 with timing techniques or VLBI imaging given the enhanced interstellar scattering along its line of sight. We present an analysis of archive Very Large Array observations at epochs from 2012 to 2022 that indicates a total proper motion of 23.9$\pm$5.5 mas yr$^{-1}$ toward the southwest. After correction for the proper motions produced by galactic rotation, we find a peculiar transverse velocity of $\simeq$740 km s$^{-1}$. We searched unsuccessfully along the past trajectory of the pulsar for an associated supernova remnant. In particular, W44 is in this trajectory but its distance is different to that of PSR B1849+00.</p>

<p>2024-08-15, <strong>New radio continuum study of the Large Magellanic Cloud Supernova Remnant N49</strong>, M. Ghavam et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07924v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.07924v1</a></p>

<p>We present new Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) radio observations toward N49, one of the brightest extragalactic Supernova remnants (SNRs) located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our new and archival ATCA radio observations were analysed along with $Chandra$ X-ray data. These observations show a prominent `bullet’ shaped feature beyond the southwestern boundary of the SNR. Both X-ray morphology and radio polarisation analysis support a physical connection of this feature to the SNR. The ‘bullet’ feature’s apparent velocity is estimated at $\sim$1300 km s$^{-1}$, based on its distance ($\sim$10 pc) from the remnant’s geometric centre and estimated age ($\sim$7600 yrs). we estimated the radio spectral index, $\alpha= -0.55 \pm 0.03$ which is typical of middle-age SNRs. Polarisation maps created for N49 show low to moderate levels of mean fractional polarisation estimated at 7$\pm$1% and 10$\pm$1% for 5.5 and 9 GHz, respectively. These values are noticeably larger than found in previous studies. Moreover, the mean value for the Faraday rotation of SNR N49 from combining CABB data is 212$\pm$65 rad m$^{-2}$ and the maximum value of RM is 591$\pm$103 rad m$^{-2}$.</p>

<p>We present the second results from Citizen ASAS-SN, a citizen science project for the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) hosted on the Zooniverse platform. Citizen ASAS-SN tasks users with classifying variable stars based on their light curves. We started with 94975 new variable candidates and identified 4432 new variable stars. The users classified the new variables as 841 pulsating variables, 2995 rotational variables, 350 eclipsing binaries, and 246 unknown variables. We found 68% user agreement for user-classified pulsating variables, 51% for rotational variables, and 77% for eclipsing binaries. We investigate user statistics and compare new variables to known variables. We present a sample of variables flagged as interesting or unusual.</p>

<p>Massive stars produce strong stellar winds that consist of continuous outflows of material at speeds of thousands of km/s. These winds convey large amounts of kinetic power, especially in the case of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. When these winds interact with nearby material, they will likely produce shocks. Among other processes, particle acceleration is expected to occur. This is particularly well established in the case of massive binary systems, where the stellar winds collide, allowing these systems to be identified thanks to the detection of synchrotron radio emission, produced by a population of relativistic particles accelerated in the shocks. Our goal is to investigate the occurrence of particle acceleration among massive stars in their pre-supernova evolution phases. To this end, we observed a subset of five WR stars in the radio domain using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), located in India. The observations were carried out in bands 4 (550-950 MHz) and 5 (1050-1450 MHz) for all the targets. We detected radio emission for only WR 110 in bands 4 and 5. Its thermal spectrum displays a consistent index of +0.74 down to uGMRT bands. The four other targets were not detected and we derived 3$\sigma$ upper limits. Our upper limits in Band 4 are the first provided for these targets below 1 GHz. None of the targets was identified as a synchrotron radio emitter in these radio bands. If some synchrotron emission is produced in these systems, the non-detection with uGMRT can be most likely attributed to strong free-free absorption (FFA). This is especially relevant for WR 98a, which is catalogued as a particle accelerator based on previous measurements at higher radio frequencies. We discuss how the prominence of FFA constitutes a severe obstacle to identifying particle accelerators in the radio domain.</p>

<p>2024-08-14, <strong>Constraining SN Ia Progenitors from the Observed Fe-peak Elemental Abundances in the Milky Way Dwarf Galaxy Satellites</strong>, Ryan K. Alexander et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07443v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2408.07443v1</a></p>

<p>Chemical abundances of iron-peak elements in the red giants of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFD) and dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph) are among the best diagnostics in the cosmos to probe the origin of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia). We incorporate metallicity-dependent SN Ia nucleosynthesis models for different progenitor masses in our inhomogeneous galactic chemical evolution model, i-GEtool, to recreate the observed elemental abundance patterns and their spread in a sample of UFD and dSph galaxies with different average metallicities and star formation histories. Observations across different environments indicate that [Mn/Mg] increases on average with metallicity while [Ni/Mg] remains nearly constant. Chemical evolution models assuming SN Ia progenitors with Chandrasekhar mass (M$_{\text{Ch}}$) produce similar to identical [Mn/Mg]-[Fe/H] and [Ni/Mg]-[Fe/H] patterns to those observed in the examined UFD and dSph galaxies, without needing to invoke a substantial fraction of sub-M$_{\text{Ch}}$ progenitors that changes across the different environments, as claimed by some previous chemical evolution studies. We note though that the observed UFD sample is still statistically poor to draw firm conclusions. Sub-M$_{\text{Ch}}$ progenitors in our dSph models systematically under produce both [Mn/Mg] and [Ni/Mg], with the 1M$_{\odot}$ model explaining a number of outliers in [Ni/Fe], while the outliers in [Mn/Mg] require higher sub-M$_{\text{Ch}}$ progenitor masses. The average dispersion of [X/Mg] from our UFD model ranges between $0.20$ and $0.25$ for iron-peak elements, with the exception of [Sc/Mg] that has $\sigma \approx 0.39$.</p>
