<p>2025-09-15, <strong>New constraints on $Z^\prime$ from captured dark matter annihilation in astrophysical objects</strong>, Basabendu Barman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12192v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.12192v1</a></p>

<p>Considering dark matter capture in astrophysical objects such as neutron stars and brown dwarfs, followed by their annihilation into two neutrino and four neutrino final states, we derive new constraints on the mass and coupling of a novel abelian gauge boson $Z^\prime$ arising from an anomaly-free $U(1)$ extension of the Standard Model. We further confront these astrophysical limits with complementary bounds from the Planck-observed relic abundance via the freeze-in mechanism, big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), gravitational wave signatures from cosmic strings, and searches at energy and intensity frontier experiments.</p>

<p>2025-09-15, <strong>DeepMET: Improving missing transverse momentum estimation with a deep neural network</strong>, CMS Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12012v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.12012v1</a></p>

<p>At hadron colliders, the net transverse momentum of particles that do not interact with the detector (missing transverse momentum, $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$) is a crucial observable in many analyses. In the standard model, $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ originates from neutrinos. Many beyond-the-standard-model particles, such as dark matter candidates, are also expected to leave the experimental apparatus undetected. This paper presents a novel $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ estimator, DeepMET, which is based on deep neural networks that were developed by the CMS Collaboration at the LHC. The DeepMET algorithm produces a weight for each reconstructed particle based on its properties. The estimator is based on the negative vector sum of the weighted transverse momenta of all reconstructed particles in an event. Compared with other estimators currently employed by CMS, DeepMET improves the $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ resolution by 10$-$30%, shows improvement for a wide range of final states, is easier to train, and is more resilient against the effects of additional proton-proton interactions accompanying the collision of interest.</p>

<p>2025-09-15, <strong>Search for Neutrino Counterparts to Gravitational Wave Events in Super-Kamiokande during the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA O4 Observing Run</strong>, L. N . Machado et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12002v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.12002v1</a></p>

<p>In recent years, the Super-Kamiokande (SK) experiment has contributed to multi-messenger astronomy by searching for neutrino signals in coincidence with gravitational wave events. The fourth observing run (O4) of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaborations started in May 2023. During the initial phase, known as O4a, LIGO identified 81 gravitational wave candidates. Neutrino follow-up searches with O4a were performed in SK. While no significant signal was observed, flux limits were computed.</p>

<p>2025-09-14, <strong>Diffusion of $^{210}\text{Pb}$ and $^{210}\text{Po}$ in Nylon</strong>, P. Adhikari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11464v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.11464v1</a></p>

<p>Radon and its progeny constitute a major source of background in rare-event physics experiments, such as those searching for dark matter, neutrinos, and neutrinoless double beta decay, due to their origin as unavoidable decay products of natural uranium. In particular, $^{222}$Rn and its long-lived daughter $^{210}$Pb can diffuse from detector material surfaces, resulting in sustained background contributions. To investigate this process, a system was developed using a controlled radon source, a vacuum chamber with a high electric field, and a thin Nylon-6 film to enable deposition of radon progeny onto the film surface. Nylon-6 was selected for the initial measurement given its history in low-background experiments. We intend to systematically study diffusion in various polymers in the future. Our setup allowed for controlled study of the diffusion behavior of $^{210}$Pb and its daughter $^{210}$Po under varying humidity conditions. Our results show that both $^{210}$Pb and $^{210}$Po diffuse significantly in nylon under high relative humidity, which can potentially lead to internal contamination and increased background in low-background detectors. The diffusivity of $^{210}$Pb was found to be lower than 1.14 $\times$ 10$^{-15}$ cm$^2$/s at 40$\%$ relative humidity (RH), and to be (4.03 $\pm$ 1.01) $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm$^2$/s at 95$\%$ RH. The diffusivity of $^{210}$Po at 95$\%$ RH was measured to be (3.94 $\pm$ 0.98) $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm$^2$/s. These findings underscore the importance of controlling environmental humidity and material exposure to radon in the design of ultra-low background experiments.</p>

<p>2025-09-14, <strong>Gravitational Waves from $\textit{Type-I}$ Strings in a Neutrino Mass Model</strong>, Adeela Afzal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11107v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.11107v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we propose a novel realization of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings arising from the spontaneous breaking of an extended gauge symmetry $SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ in the context of a low-scale split seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation. We demonstrate that the split seesaw framework, which explains the smallness of neutrino masses, naturally motivates a small scalar self-coupling $\lambda$. This intrinsically links the neutrino mass generation mechanism to the formation of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings, where the gauge coupling dominates over the scalar self-coupling ($\beta\equiv\lambda/2g^2&lt;1$). We explore the cosmological implications of these strings, including their gravitational wave signatures that are testable in current and future experiments. Our findings establish a compelling and testable connection between neutrino mass generation and cosmic string phenomenology in an underexplored region of parameter space.</p>

<p>2025-09-15, <strong>An Optomechanical Accelerometer Search for Ultralight Dark Matter</strong>, M. Dey Chowdhury et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12175v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.12175v1</a></p>

<p>We use a cavity optomechanical accelerometer to perform a resonant search for ultralight dark matter at acoustic frequencies near 39 kHz (a particle mass of $0.16$ neV/$c^2$). The accelerometer is based on a Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane, cryogenically cooled to 4 K, with photothermal heating employed to scan the resonance frequency by $10^2$ detector linewidths. Leveraging shot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation pressure feedback cooling, we realize an acceleration resolution of $\sim 10\;\text{n}g_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over a bandwidth of $30$ Hz near the fundamental test mass resonance. We find no evidence of a dark matter signal and infer an upper bound on the coupling to normal matter that is several orders of magnitude above the stringent bounds set by equivalence principle experiments. We outline a path toward novel dark matter constraints in future experiments by exploiting arrays of mass-loaded optomechanical sensors at lower temperature probed with distributed squeezed light.</p>

<p>2025-09-15, <strong>A Short Introduction to Cosmology and its Current Status</strong>, Pedro G. Ferreira et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12121v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.12121v1</a></p>

<p>The current cosmological model, known as the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model (or $\Lambda$CDM for short) is one of the most astonishing accomplishments of contemporary theoretical physics. It is a well-defined mathematical model which depends on very few ingredients and parameters and is able to make a range of predictions and postdictions with astonishing accuracy. It is built out of well-known physics - general relativity, quantum mechanics and atomic physics, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics - and predicts the existence of new, unseen components. Again and again it has been shown to fit new data sets with remarkable precision. Despite these successes, we have yet to understand the unseen components of the Universe and there has been evidence for inconsistencies in the model. In these lectures, we lay the foundations of modern cosmology.</p>

<p>2025-09-15, <strong>Gravitational Signatures of Axion Dark Matter via Parity-Violating Interactions</strong>, Marco Figliolia et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12038v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.12038v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate axion-like particles coupled to gravity through a parity-violating Chern-Simons (CS) interaction. In this framework, axion dark matter (DM) can decay into pairs of circularly polarized gravitons, producing a persistent, nearly monochromatic GW signal. We compute the expected signal at Earth assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White Galactic halo model with the corresponding velocity distribution, and compare it with the narrowband sensitivities of the LIGO O4 run and the projected reach of the Einstein Telescope. The resulting bounds on the axion-graviton coupling $\alpha$ improve upon the cosmological stability requirement for axion masses $m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV, excluding values up to four orders of magnitude below the stability limit. This constitutes a robust direct terrestrial constraint on the axion-gravity CS coupling. We also discuss distinctive observational signatures, such as circular polarization asymmetries, annual modulation, and potential enhancements from DM substructures, which could serve as smoking-gun evidence for parity-violating gravitational interactions.</p>

<p>2025-09-15, <strong>Dark Parton Shower Effects for Cosmic Ray Boosted Dark Matter</strong>, Zirong Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12007v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.12007v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the dark parton shower effects in the direct detection of cosmic-ray boosted dark matter (CRDM), focusing on a dark photon-mediated model with fermionic dark matter-electron interactions. Utilizing a Monte Carlo framework to incorporate the Sudakov form factors and kinematic dipole recoil schemes, we simulate the CRDM energy spectrum evolution under the dark sector splitting. Our results reveal a significant energy-dependent modification of the CRDM flux. For a 1 keV dark matter (DM) mass and a coupling of $g_D=3$, the CRDM flux can be enhanced by a factor up to 1.12 in the $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2} \sim 1)$ MeV energy range for $2m_\chi \lesssim m_{A^\prime} \lesssim 10^{-2}$ MeV, while it is suppressed by more than $50\%$ at energy around 100 MeV for $m_{A^\prime} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ MeV. We then translate these effects into the experimental sensitivities for PandaX-4T, Super-Kamiokande, and JUNO. At $m_{A^\prime} = 10^{-3}$ MeV and $g_D=3$, the bounds on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon^2$ are relaxed by factors of 1.02, 1.6 and 1.4, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that the parameter space considered is consistent with those astrophysical constraints on dark matter self-interactions from observations of the Bullet Cluster.</p>

<p>2025-09-15, <strong>Enhanced Cosmic-Ray Cooling in AGN from Dark Matter Deep Inelastic Scattering</strong>, Linjie Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11906v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.11906v1</a></p>

<p>The diffusion of high-energy cosmic rays (CRs) through the dark matter (DM) spikes of active galactic nuclei entails significant energy loss via interactions with DM. While previous studies of sub-GeV DM have focused on elastic scattering, this process becomes insufficient at higher proton energies and DM masses. In this work, we investigate the CR-DM deep inelastic scattering (DIS) as mediated by a vector portal. We calculate the DIS contribution to the CR energy loss rate and derive stringent exclusion limits on the CR-DM scattering cross-section for DM masses between $10^{-6}$ GeV and $1$ GeV. For higher CR energies and mediator masses, the resulting CR cooling timescales are reduced by orders of magnitude after involving the DIS contribution, producing stringent constraints that surpass most of current experimental limits.</p>

<p>2025-09-15, <strong>Testing CCC+TL Cosmology with Galaxy Rotation Curves</strong>, Rajendra P. Gupta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11896v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.11896v1</a></p>

<p>This paper aims to explore whether astrophysical observations, primarily galaxy rotation curves, result from covarying coupling constants (CCC) rather than from dark matter. We have shown in earlier papers that cosmological observations, such as supernovae type 1a (Pantheon+), the small size of galaxies at cosmic dawn, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the sound horizon in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and time dilation effect, can be easily accounted for without requiring dark energy and dark matter when coupling constants are permitted to evolve in an expanding Universe, as predicted by Dirac, and the redshift is considered jointly due to the Universe’s expansion and Zwicky’s tired light (TL) effect. Here, we show that the CCC parameter {\alpha} is responsible for generating the illusion of dark matter and dark energy, which we call {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy, and is influenced by the baryonic matter density distribution. While cosmologically {\alpha} is a constant determined for the homogenous and isotropic Universe, e.g., by fitting Pantheon+ data, it can vary locally due to the extreme anisotropy of the matter distribution. Thus, in high baryonic density regions, one expects {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy densities to be relatively low and vice versa. We present its application to a few galaxy rotation curves from the SPARC database and find the results promising.</p>

<p>2025-09-15, <strong>Letter of Intent: 100m Atom Interferometer Experiment at CERN</strong>, Charles Baynham et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11867v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.11867v1</a></p>

<p>We propose an O(100)m Atom Interferometer (AI) experiment to be installed against a wall of the PX46 access shaft to the LHC. This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment. We foresee that, if the CERN management encourages this Letter of Intent, a significant fraction of the Terrestrial Very Long Baseline Atom Interferometer (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration may wish to contribute to such an AI experiment.</p>

<p>2025-09-15, <strong>Precise Measurement of the Absolute Sky Brightness at 60 to 350 MHz</strong>, Luke McKay et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11846v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.11846v1</a></p>

<p>Precise measurement of the sky radio brightness below 1 GHz and estimation of any unaccounted-for extragalactic brightness is required to understand the Galactic cosmic ray electron spectrum, to constrain populations of nanojansky radio sources, and to constrain dark matter annihilation or decay. The foreground radio brightness must also be accurately accounted for when measuring the cosmic background radiation and departures from its Planck spectrum that trace astrophysical processes in the early Universe, cosmic dark ages, cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionisation. Here we report a new, precision measurement of the sky spectral brightness over radio frequencies from 60 MHz to 350 MHz. Our measurement motivates a significant correction to previous all-sky images made in this band and the Global Sky Model (GSM) that is constructed from these and other sky images made at radio wavelengths. We find that the GSM requires subtraction of an offset exceeding 100K below 100 MHz and scaling up by a factor of approximately 1.2 below 200 MHz rising to a factor of 1.5 at 350 MHz, thus significantly enhancing previous estimates of unaccounted excess in radio sky brightness. Our measurements were made with a new receiver architecture that dynamically self-calibrates for receiver noise and bandpass in situ, while connected to an antenna. We used a single, accurately modelled, wideband logperiodic antenna placed on a 40m diameter ground mesh. Our accurate measurement requires upward revision of sky brightness and motivates revisiting models for source populations and dark matter decay. Additionally, sky models scaled to our measurements serve as a stable reference in calibrating the absolute flux density scale for low-frequency radio telescopes. This will be important for calibration accuracy of the SKA-Low telescope, that will operate at the frequencies of our measurements.</p>

<p>2025-09-15, <strong>Investigating the correlations of bulk properties of hyperon star with dark matter</strong>, Rashmita Jena et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11758v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.11758v1</a></p>

<p>The strong gravitational pull of the neutron star leads to the accretion of dark matter (DM) inside the core of the neutron star. The accretion of DM affects the bulk properties of the neutron star. Here, we study how the accretion of WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) dark matter particles affects the $\Delta-$admixed hyperon star’s bulk properties specifically mass, radius, tidal deformability, $f-$mode frequency and moment of inertia. The inclusion of dark matter softens the EOS (equation of state) and reduces the maximum possible mass, canonical radius, canonical tidal deformability, and moment of inertia of canonical star. However, the $f-$mode frequency of the canonical star increases. We find a cubical correlation between the dark matter fermi momenta $k_f^{DM}$ and bulk properties of canonical star.</p>

<p>2025-09-14, <strong>Probing Hernquist dark matter with black hole shadows: A comprehensive study of various accretions</strong>, Yuxuan Shi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11245v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.11245v1</a></p>

<p>The appearance of a black hole shadow, in both astronomical observations and theoretical analysis, depends critically on the properties of the surrounding accretion. In this study, we analyse the emission and observational properties of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Hernquist dark matter (DM) halo by considering three simplified accretion models, which have not been previously explored in such detail. Based on our findings, direct emission contributes markedly to the whole observed intensity for a Schwarzschild-Hernquist black hole encircled by a geometrically thin accretion disk. The corresponding regions and measured intensities of the lensing ring, the photon ring, and direct emission are sensitive to the parameters of the Hernquist DM halo. Apart from disk accretion, we also study two spherical accretion models: static and infalling. With increasing Hernquist DM parameters, both models exhibit a significant decrease in the measured intensity, yet the photon spheres are enlarged by an increase of $\sim2\%$ to $\sim30\%$. Furthermore, Doppler de-boosting due to the infalling accretion results in darker shadow images compared to static cases. By precising visualisations of the shadows, our results suggest that the observational characteristics of black hole shadows can serve as a powerful probe for distinguishing between different DM distributions around supermassive black holes.</p>

<p>The 21-cm line of hydrogen is the most promising probe of the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum, focusing on redshifts $z=20-40$. As the clumping effect arises from small-scale density fluctuations, it offers a unique opportunity to probe the standard cold dark matter model in a new regime and thus potentially investigate the properties of dark matter. To this end, we also study a warm dark matter $-$ like model with a Gaussian cutoff on a scale of 50 kpc. We find that clumping has a significant impact on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum. For example, for the Dark Ages case at $z=30$ and wavenumber $k=0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$, small-scale clustering enhances the 21-cm power spectrum by $13\%$. Once Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling kicks in due to the first stars, the 21-cm signal strengthens, and the effect of clumping grows; it suppresses the observable power spectrum at $z=20$ by a factor of two, while the cutoff model has less than half the clumping impact. The clumping effect is significantly higher than the sensitivity of the planned Square Kilometre Array (SKA) AA$^\star$ configuration, by up to a factor of 20 for standard cold dark matter, though detection will require separation from foregrounds and from astrophysical contributions to the 21-cm power spectrum.</p>

<p>We propose that dark matter (DM) possesses a quadratic equation of state, which becomes significant at high densities, altering the Universe’s evolution during its early stages. We derive the modified background evolution equations for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the DM density parameter $\Omega_{\text{dm}}(z)$. We then perturb the governing equations to study the linear growth of matter fluctuations, computing the observable growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$. Finally, we compare the model with the latest cosmological data, including Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, and growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$ data, up to $z=3$. Our results indicate that the quadratic model, while remaining consistent with background observations, offers a distinct imprint on the growth of structure, providing not only a new phenomenological avenue to address cosmological tensions but also shedding light on the nature of DM.</p>

<p>2025-09-14, <strong>The Signature of Sub-galactic Dark Matter Clumping in the Global 21-cm Signal of Hydrogen</strong>, Hyunbae Park et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11055v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.11055v1</a></p>

<p>It is thought that the Universe went through an early period known as the Dark Ages, during which primeval density fluctuations grew to form the first luminous objects, marking the beginning of Cosmic Dawn around 100 million years after the Big Bang. The 21-cm line of hydrogen atoms is the most promising probe of these epochs, with extensive observational efforts underway. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to precisely calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the global (sky-averaged) 21-cm radio intensity. We show that it presents a potential opportunity to probe the properties of dark matter in a new regime, corresponding to a length-scale of only 150,000 light years and a mass-scale of 20 million Solar masses. This effect can in principle be detected unambiguously during the Dark Ages, where the weak signal requires an array of global signal antennae. During Cosmic Dawn, when stellar radiation boosts the signal, a single global antenna suffices, but the clumping effect must then be separated from the effect of the stars. Our findings open new avenues for testing the nature of dark matter as well as non-standard cosmological models.</p>

<p>2025-09-15, <strong>Chandra Large Project Observations of the Supernova Remnant N132D: Measuring the Expansion of the Forward Shock</strong>, Xi Long et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12157v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.12157v1</a></p>

<p>We present results from the Chandra X-ray Observatory Large Project (878 ks in 28 observations) of the Large Magellanic Cloud supernova remnant N132D. We measure the expansion of the forward shock in the bright southern rim to be $0.!^{\prime\prime}10 \pm 0.!^{\prime\prime}02$ over the $\sim14.5$ yr baseline, which corresponds to a velocity of $1620\pm400~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ after accounting for several instrumental effects. We measure an expansion of $0.!^{\prime\prime}23 \pm 0.!^{\prime\prime}02$ and a shock velocity of $3840\pm260~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ for two features in an apparent blowout region in the northeast. The emission-measure-weighted average temperature inferred from X-ray spectral fits to regions in the southern rim is $0.95\pm0.17$ keV, consistent with the electron temperature implied by the shock velocity after accounting for Coulomb equilibration and adiabatic expansion. In contrast, the emission-measure-weighted average temperature for the northeast region is $0.77\pm0.04$ keV, which is significantly lower than the value inferred from the shock velocity. We fit 1-D evolutionary models for the shock in the southern rim and northeast region, using the measured radius and propagation velocity into a constant density and power-law profile circumstellar medium. We find good agreement with the age of $\sim2500$ years derived from optical expansion measurements for explosion energies of $1.5-3.0 \times 10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}$, ejecta masses of $2-6 \,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and ambient medium densities of $\sim0.33-0.66$ $\mathrm{amu~cm}^{-3}$ in the south and $\sim0.01-0.02$ $\mathrm{amu~cm}^{-3}$ in the northeast assuming a constant density medium. These results are consistent with previous studies that suggested the progenitor of N132D was an energetic supernova that exploded into a pre-existing cavity.</p>

<p>2025-09-15, <strong>Observational Evidence of Dust Evolution in Supernova Remnants: Size Redistribution Toward Larger Grains in Early Sedov Phase</strong>, He Zhao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12067v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.12067v1</a></p>

<p>Recent observations have revealed that dust is widespread and abundant in galaxies up to $z\,{\backsimeq}\,8$, significantly influencing their appearance and spectral properties. In the early Universe, dust is thought to form primarily in supernova (SN) ejecta, but also undergoes destruction by the reverse shock. Studying dust in local supernova remnants (SNRs) of different sizes and ages thus provides key constraints on dust formation and evolution during cosmic dawn. Using the newly released 3D $R_{\rm V}$ map, we derived local $R_{\rm V} \equiv A_{\rm V}/E(B-V)$ values for dust in 14 Galactic SNRs in the early Sedov phase and their surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). For the first time, we detect a moderately strong positive correlation between the difference in SNR and ISM $R_{\rm V}$ ($\Delta R_{\rm V}$) and SNR radius ($R_{\rm SNR}$), with a Spearman coefficient of $r_{\rm s}\,{=}\,0.62\,{\pm}\,0.14$. This trend offers direct observational evidence for a redistribution of dust grain sizes toward larger grains during SN shock processing, consistent with theoretical models. Our findings provide essential observational constraints on dust size evolution in SNRs and important implications for understanding the rapid enrichment and survival of dust in the early Universe.</p>

<p>2025-09-15, <strong>The dependence of the Type Ia Supernova colour-luminosity relation on their host galaxy properties</strong>, S. Ramaiya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12035v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.12035v1</a></p>

<p>Using the Dark Energy Survey 5-year sample, we determine the properties of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) host galaxies across a wide multi-wavelength range - from the optical to far-infrared - including data from the $Herschel$ and $Spitzer$ space telescopes. We categorise the SNe Ia into three distinct groups according to the distribution of their host galaxies on the star-formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass ($M_\star$) plane. Each region comprises host galaxies at distinct stages in their evolutionary pathways: Region 1 - low-mass hosts; Region 2 - high-mass, star-forming hosts and Region 3 - high-mass, passive hosts. We find SNe Ia in host galaxies located in Region 1 have the steepest slope (quantified by $\beta$) between their colours and luminosities, with $\beta_{\mathrm{R_1}} = 3.51 \pm 0.16$. This differs at the ${\sim}6\sigma$ significance level to SNe Ia in Region 3, which have the shallowest colour-luminosity slope with $\beta_{\mathrm{R_3}} = 2.12 \pm 0.16$. After correcting SNe Ia in each subsample by their respective $\beta$, events in Region 3 (high-mass, passive hosts) are $0.07 - 0.12$ mag ($&gt;3\sigma$) brighter, post-standardisation. We conclude that future cosmological analyses should apply standardisation relations to SNe Ia based upon the region in which the SN host galaxy lies in the SFR-$M_\star$ plane. Alternatively, cosmological analyses should restrict the SN Ia sample to events whose host galaxies occupy a single region of this plane.</p>

<p>2025-09-15, <strong>Testing CCC+TL Cosmology with Galaxy Rotation Curves</strong>, Rajendra P. Gupta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11896v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.11896v1</a></p>

<p>This paper aims to explore whether astrophysical observations, primarily galaxy rotation curves, result from covarying coupling constants (CCC) rather than from dark matter. We have shown in earlier papers that cosmological observations, such as supernovae type 1a (Pantheon+), the small size of galaxies at cosmic dawn, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the sound horizon in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and time dilation effect, can be easily accounted for without requiring dark energy and dark matter when coupling constants are permitted to evolve in an expanding Universe, as predicted by Dirac, and the redshift is considered jointly due to the Universe’s expansion and Zwicky’s tired light (TL) effect. Here, we show that the CCC parameter {\alpha} is responsible for generating the illusion of dark matter and dark energy, which we call {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy, and is influenced by the baryonic matter density distribution. While cosmologically {\alpha} is a constant determined for the homogenous and isotropic Universe, e.g., by fitting Pantheon+ data, it can vary locally due to the extreme anisotropy of the matter distribution. Thus, in high baryonic density regions, one expects {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy densities to be relatively low and vice versa. We present its application to a few galaxy rotation curves from the SPARC database and find the results promising.</p>

<p>Understanding the formation and evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) requires a thorough investigation of the key physical processes involved. While one pathway involves the isolated evolution of massive binary stars, affected by uncertain stages like core-collapse supernovae and common envelope evolution, an alternative channel is dynamical formation in dense stellar environments. Newtonian gravity has traditionally provided a robust and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale gravitational interactions. However, accurately capturing close encounters and black hole mergers necessitates the use of general relativity. This work focuses on assessing the applicability of post-Newtonian gravity in bridging these regimes, offering a physically insightful and computationally tractable approach to modeling BBH formation in the gravitational-wave era of astronomy.</p>

<p>2025-09-15, <strong>Self-lensing binaries as probes of Supernova physics</strong>, Grzegorz Wiktorowicz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11726v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.11726v1</a></p>

<p>Self-lensing (SL) in binary systems has the potential to provide a unique observational window into the Galactic population of compact objects. Using the $\mathtt{startrack}$ and COSMIC population synthesis codes, we investigate how different supernova mechanisms affect the observable population of SL systems, with particular attention to the mass gap (2$\mathrm{-}$5 M$_\odot$) in compact object distributions. We test three supernova remnant formation models with different convective growth timescales ($f_{\rm mix}$ = 0.5, 1.0, and 4.0), simulating SL binary systems across the Galactic disk and bulge. We identify distinct groupings of SL sources based on lens mass and Einstein crossing time, clearly differentiating neutron star from black hole systems and close from wide orbits. Notably, the delayed $f_{\rm mix} = 0.5$ model predicts a significantly higher fraction of systems with lens masses in the mass gap region (up to $\sim10$ times more for certain surveys), suggesting that SL observations could help constrain this controversial population. Our analysis reveals a strong preference for systems with low centre-of-mass velocities ($v_{\rm cm}\leq20$ km/s) across all models, resulting primarily from physical processes governing compact object formation and binary survival. While many potential detections will have limited observational coverage, ZTF is predicted to yield several dozen well-covered systems that should enable detailed characterization. When applying simple detection criteria including photometric precision and signal-to-noise requirements, predicted rates decrease by approximately two orders of magnitude, but still yield up to a few tens of expected detections for LSST and ZTF in the Galactic disk population.</p>

<p>2025-09-14, <strong>Simulations of Tidal Disruption of Supernova in Galaxy Nuclear Region: A Novel Model for Ambiguous Nuclear Transients</strong>, Xiangli Lei et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11186v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.11186v1</a></p>

<p>An increasing number of ambiguous nuclear transients, including some extreme nuclear transients, have been reported, which cannot be simply explained by the tidal disruption event (TDE) due to their high energy and/or overmassive black holes. Stars that form in or are captured by AGN disks will grow and migrate inward, potentially exploding as supernovae once the inner cold accretion disk disappears during the phase of AGN decay. We propose that tidal disruption of a supernova (TDS) by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can produce nuclear transients that are even more luminous than typical TDEs and are not limited by the SMBH mass. In this scenario, the SMBH can capture the supernova ejecta, which subsequently self-intersects and circularizes into an accretion disk. Based on hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the accretion rate of the TDS disk exhibits a slow decline that can last for months to decades. The peak accretion rate of a typical core-collapse SN scenario can exceed the Eddington limit for SMBHs with $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{7.5}\,M_\odot$, while it remains sub-Eddington for more massive SMBHs. This model provides a mechanism for triggering an energetic TDE-like flare with luminosity (\gtrsim10^{45}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) in galaxies with $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{8}\,M_\odot$ or triggering turn-on changing-look AGNs.</p>
