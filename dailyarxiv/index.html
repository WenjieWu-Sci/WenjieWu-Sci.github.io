<p>2023-05-29, <strong>Thermal Leptogenesis in the Minimal Gauged $U(1)_{L_μ-L_τ}$ Model</strong>, Alessandro Granelli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18100v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.18100v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the thermal leptogenesis mechanism within the minimal gauged U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU). In such framework, the phases of the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata neutrino mixing matrix and the sum of the Standard Model neutrino masses are predictable because of a restricted neutrino mass matrix structure. Additionally, in the context of thermal leptogenesis, the BAU can be computed in terms of the three remaining free variables that parameterise the right-handed neutrino masses and their Yukawa couplings to the Higgs and lepton doublets. We identify the ranges of such parameters for which the correct BAU can be reproduced. We adopt the formalism of the density matrix equations to fully account for flavour effects and consider the decays of all the three right-handed neutrinos. Our analysis reveals that thermal leptogenesis is feasible within a wide parameter space, specifically for Yukawa couplings ranging from approximate unity to $\mathcal{O}(0.03-0.05)$ and mass of the lightest right-handed neutrino $M_1\gtrsim 10^{11-12}\,\text{GeV}$, setting a leptogenesis scale in the considered model which is higher than that of the non-thermal scenario.</p>

<p>2023-05-28, <strong>Solar neutrinos with CE$ν$NS and flavor-dependent radiative corrections</strong>, Nityasa Mishra et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17827v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.17827v1</a></p>

<p>We examine solar neutrinos in dark matter detectors including the effects of flavor-dependent radiative corrections to the CE$\nu$NS cross section. Working within a full three-flavor framework, and including matter effects within the Sun and Earth, detectors with thresholds $\lesssim 1$ keV and exposures of $\sim 100$ ton-year could identify contributions to the cross section beyond tree level. The differences between the cross sections for the flavors, combined with the difference in fluxes, would provide a new and unique method to study the muon and tau components of the solar neutrino flux. Flavor-dependent corrections induce a small day-night asymmetry of $&lt; |3 \times10^{-4}|$ in the event rate, which if ultimately accessible would provide a novel probe of flavor oscillations.</p>

<p>2023-05-29, <strong>Unraveling the CMB lack-of-correlation anomaly with the cosmological gravitational wave background</strong>, Giacomo Galloni et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18184v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.18184v1</a></p>

<p>Since the very first observations, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) has revealed on large-scales unexpected features known as anomalies, which challenge the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model. One such anomaly is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lack-of-correlation'', where the measured two-point angular correlation function of CMB temperature anisotropies is compatible with zero, differently from the predictions of the standard model. This anomaly could indicate a deviation from the standard model, unknown systematics, or simply a rare realization of the model itself. In this study, we explore the possibility that the lack-of-correlation anomaly is a consequence of living in a rare realization of the standard model, by leveraging the potential information provided by the cosmological gravitational wave background (CGWB) detectable by future gravitational wave (GW) interferometers. We analyze both constrained and unconstrained realizations of the CGWB to investigate the extent of information that GWs can offer. To quantify the impact of the CGWB on the lack-of-correlation anomaly, we employ established estimators and introduce a new estimator that addresses the</code>look-elsewhere’’ effect. Additionally, we consider three different maximum multipoles, denoted as $\ell_{\rm max}$, to account for the anticipated capabilities of future GW detectors ($\ell_{\rm max} = 4, 6, 10$). Summarizing our findings for the case of $\ell_{\rm max} = 4$, we identify the angular range $[63^\circ - 180^\circ]$ as the region where future observations of the CGWB maximize the probability of rejecting the standard model. Furthermore, we calculate the expected significance of this observation, demonstrating that 98.81% (81.67%) of the GW realizations enhance the current significance of the anomaly when considering the full-sky (masked) Planck SMICA map as our CMB sky.</p>

<p>2023-05-28, <strong>Modelling the mass accretion histories of dark matter haloes using a Gamma formalism</strong>, Antonios Katsianis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17772v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.17772v1</a></p>

<p>We present a physical model of the Mass Accretion Histories (MAH) of haloes in concordance with the {\it observed} cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD). We model the MAHs of dark matter haloes using a Gamma ($\Gamma$) functional form: $M_h(T) = \frac{M_0}{f_{0}} \, \times \frac{\gamma(\alpha_h, ~\beta_h \times (T-Th))}{\Gamma(\alpha_h)}$, where $M_0$ is the halo mass at present time, $T$ is time, $\alpha_h$ and $\beta_h$ are parameters we explore, $f_{0}$ is the percentage of the mass of the halo at z = 0 with respect to the final mass of the halo achieved at $T = \infty$. We use the MAHs of haloes obtained from cosmological simulations and analytical models to constrain our model. $f_{0}$ can be described by a power-law ($f_{0} = 1- c \times M_{0}^{d}$). Haloes with small masses have already on average attained most of their final masses. The average $&lt;f_{0}&gt;$ of haloes in the Universe is $ &gt; 0.95$ pointing to the direction that the cosmic MAH/CSFRD is saturated at our era. The average $&lt;\beta_{h}&gt;$ parameter (the depletion rate of the available dark matter for halo growth) is related to the dynamical timescales of haloes. The $\alpha$ parameter is a power-law index of $M_{0}$ and represents the early growth a halo experiences before the expansion of the Universe starts to slow it down. Finally, $T_{h}$ (the time that marks the co-evolution/growth of galaxies and haloes after the Big Bang) is found to be 150-300 million years.</p>

<p>2023-05-28, <strong>Eliminating the Hubble Tension in the Presence of the Interconnection between Dark Energy and Matter in the Modern Universe</strong>, G. S. Bisnovatyi-Kogan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17722v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.17722v1</a></p>

<p>It is accepted in modern cosmology that the scalar field responsible for the inflationary stage of the early Universe is completely transformed into matter. It is assumed that the accelerated expansion is currently driven by dark energy (DE), which is likely determined by Einstein’s cosmological constant. We consider a cosmological model where DE can have two components, one of which is Einstein’s constant ($\Lambda$) and the other, smaller variable component DEV ($\Lambda_V$), is associated with the remnant of the scalar field that caused inflation after the main part of the scalar field has turned into matter. It is assumed that such a transformation continues at the present time and is accompanied by the reverse process of the DM transformation into a scalar field. The interconnection between DM and DEV, which leads to a linear relationship between the energy densities of these components after recombination $\rho_{DM}=\alpha\;\rho_{DEV}$, is considered. Variants with a dependence of the coefficient $\alpha(z)$ on the redshift are also considered. One of the problems that have arisen in modern cosmology, called Hubble Tension (HT), is the discrepancy between the present values of the Hubble constant measured from observations at small redshifts $z\lesssim1$ and the values found from fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background at large redshifts $z\approx1100$. In the considered model, this discrepancy can be explained by the deviation of the real cosmological model from the conventional cold dark matter (CDM) model of the Universe by action of the additional DE component at the stages after recombination. Within this extended model, we consider various $\alpha(z)$ functions that can eliminate the HT. To maintain the ratio of DEV and DM energy densities close to constant over the interval $0\le z\le1100$, we assume the existence of a wide spectrum of DM particle masses.</p>

<p>2023-05-29, <strong>O, Ne, Mg, and Fe abundances in hot X-ray emitting halos of galaxy clusters, groups, and giant early-type galaxies with XMM-Newton RGS spectroscopy</strong>, Kotaro Fukushima et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18137v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.18137v1</a></p>

<p>Chemical elements in the hot medium permeating early-type galaxies, groups, and clusters make them an excellent laboratory for studying metal enrichment and cycling processes in the largest scales of the Universe. Here, we report the XMM-Newton RGS analysis of 14 early-type galaxies, including the well-known brightest cluster galaxies of Perseus, for instance. The spatial distribution of the O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe ratios is generally flat at the central 60 arcsecond regions of each object, irrespective of whether or not a central Fe abundance drop has been reported. Common profiles between noble gas and normal metal suggest that the dust depletion process does not work predominantly in these systems. Therefore, observed abundance drops are possibly attributed to other origins, like systematics in the atomic codes. Giant systems of high gas mass-to-luminosity ratio tend to hold a hot gas ($\sim$ 2 keV) yielding the solar N/Fe, O/Fe, Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe, and Ni/Fe ratios. Contrarily, light systems at a subkiloelectronvolt temperature regime, including isolated or group-centered galaxies, generally exhibit super-solar N/Fe, Ni/Fe, Ne/O, and Mg/O ratios. We find that the latest supernova nucleosynthesis models fail to reproduce such a super-solar abundance pattern. Possible systematic uncertainties contributing to these high abundance ratios of cool objects are also discussed in tandem with the crucial role of future X-ray missions.</p>

<p>2023-05-29, <strong>Magnetar Flare-Driven Bumpy Declining Light Curves in Hydrogen-poor Superluminous Supernovae</strong>, Xiao-Fei Dong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17983v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.17983v1</a></p>

<p>Recent observations indicate that hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae often display bumpy declining light curves. However, the cause of these undulations remains unclear. In this paper, we have improved the magnetar model, which includes flare activities. We present a systematic analysis of a well-observed SLSNe-I sample with bumpy light curves in the late-phase. These SLSNe-I were identified from multiple transient surveys, such as the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1 MDS) and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Our study provides a set of magnetar-powered model light curve fits for five SLSNe-I, which accurately reproduce observed light curves using reasonable physical parameters. By extracting essential characteristics of both explosions and central engines, these fits provide valuable insights into investigating their potential association with gamma ray burst engines. We found that the SLSN flares tend to be the dim and long extension of the GRB flares in the peak luminosity versus peak time plane. Conducting large-scale, high cadence surveys in the near future could enhance our comprehension of both SLSN undulation properties and their potential relationship with GRBs by modeling their light curve characteristics.</p>

<p>2023-05-29, <strong>Type W and Type 15bn subgroups of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae: pre-maximum diversity, post-maximum homogeneity?</strong>, Réka Könyves-Tóth et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17963v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.17963v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, we analyze the post-maximum spectra of a sample of 27 Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) in order to search for physical differences between the so-called Type W and Type 15bn sub-types. This paper is a continuation of \citet{ktr21} and \citet{ktr22}. In the former, it was revealed that not all SLSNe-I show the W-shaped absorption feature between 4000 and 5000 \AA\ in the pre-maximum spectra, and two new SLSN-subgroups were disclosed: Type W, where the W-shaped feature is present, and Type 15bn, where it is missing. In the latter, it was shown that the pre-maximum photosphere of Type W SLSNe-I tend to be hotter compared to Type 15bn objects, and they are different regarding their ion composition, their early light curves and their geometry as well. For completeness, post-maximum data are analyzed in this paper. It is concluded that in terms of photospheric temperature and velocity, Type W and Type 15bn SLSNe decrease to a similar value by the post-maximum phases, and their pseudo-nebular spectra are nearly uniform. Pseudo-equivalent width calculations show that the pEW of the wavelength range between 4166 and 5266 \AA\ evolve differently in case of the two sub-types, while the other parts of the spectra seem to evolve similarly. It was found that the host galaxies of the studied objects do not differ significantly in their star formation rate, morphology, stellar mass and absolute brightness. The main difference behind the bimodality of Type W and Type 15bn SLSNe-I therefore is in their pre-maximum evolution.</p>

<p>2023-05-28, <strong>Future evolution due to backreaction in a Universe with multiple inhomogeneous domains</strong>, Ashadul Halder et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17616v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.17616v1</a></p>

<p>We formulate a model of spacetime with inhomogeneous matter distribution in multiple domains. In the context of the backreaction framework using Buchert’s averaging procedure, we evaluate the effect of backreaction due to the inhomogeneities on the late time global evolution of the Universe. Examining the future evolution of this universe, we find that it can transit from the presently accelerating phase to undergo future deceleration. The future deceleration is governed by our model parameters. We constrain the model parameters using observational analysis of the Union 2.1 supernova Ia data employing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.</p>
