<p>2024-04-25, <strong>Cosmological probes of Dark Radiation from Neutrino Mixing</strong>, Itamar J. Allali et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16822v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.16822v1</a></p>

<p>Models of stepped dark radiation have recently been found to have an important impact on the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background, aiding in easing the Hubble tension. In this work, we study models with a sector of dark radiation with a step in its abundance, which thermalizes after big bang nucleosynthesis by mixing with the standard model neutrinos. For this, we extend an earlier work which has focused on the background evolution only until the dark sector thermalizes by deriving the full background and perturbation equations of the model and implementing them in an Einstein-Boltzmann solving code. We expound on the behavior of this model, discussing the wide range of parameters that result in interesting and viable cosmologies that dynamically generate dark radiation during a range of epochs. We find that for the strongly self-coupled regime, there is no large cosmological impact for a tight prior on the mass, whereas larger mass ranges allow a smooth interpolation between a behavior close to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological standard model and close to an additional component of strongly self-interacting dark radiation. In the weakly self-coupled regime we find that we can accommodate a parameter space relevant for the neutrino anomalies as well as one relevant to easing the Hubble tension.</p>

<p>2024-04-25, <strong>Accelerated inference on accelerated cosmic expansion: New constraints on axion-like early dark energy with DESI BAO and ACT DR6 CMB lensing</strong>, Frank J. Qu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16805v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.16805v1</a></p>

<p>The early dark energy (EDE) extension to $\Lambda$CDM has been proposed as a candidate scenario to resolve the “Hubble tension”. We present new constraints on the EDE model by incorporating new data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) survey and CMB lensing measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 and \textit{Planck} NPIPE data. We do not find evidence for EDE. The maximum fractional contribution of EDE to the total energy density is $f_\mathrm{EDE}&lt; 0.091 \; (95\% \; \mathrm{CL} )$ from our baseline combination of \textit{Planck} CMB, CMB lensing, and DESI BAO. Our strongest constraints on EDE come from the combination of \textit{Planck} CMB and CMB lensing alone, yielding $f_\mathrm{EDE}&lt; 0.070 \; (95\% \; \mathrm{CL} )$. We also explore extensions of $\Lambda$CDM beyond the EDE parameters by treating the total neutrino mass as a free parameter, finding $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.096 \,\, {\rm eV} \; (95\% \; \mathrm{CL} )$ and $f_\mathrm{EDE}&lt; 0.087 \; (95\% \; \mathrm{CL} )$. For the first time in EDE analyses, we perform Bayesian parameter estimation using neural network emulators of cosmological observables, which are on the order of a hundred times faster than full Boltzmann solutions.</p>

<p>2024-04-25, <strong>Calculable neutrino Dirac mass matrix and one-loop $\bar θ$ in the minimal left-right symmetric model</strong>, Gang Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16740v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.16740v1</a></p>

<p>We revisit the contribution to the strong CP parameter $\bar \theta$ from leptonic CP violation at one-loop level in the minimal left-right symmetric model in the case of parity as the left-right symmetry. The Hermitian neutrino Dirac mass matrix $M_D$ can be calculated using the light and heavy neutrino masses and mixings. We propose a parameterization of the right-handed neutrino mixing matrix $V_R$ and construct the heavy neutrino mass that maintains the Hermiticity of $M_D$. We further apply it to evaluate the one-loop $\bar\theta$, denoted as $\bar \theta_{loop}$, as a function of the sterile neutrino masses for explicit examples of $V_R$. By requiring the magnitude of $\bar \theta_{loop}\lesssim 10^{-10}$, we derive the upper limits on the sterile neutrino masses, which are within reach of direct searches at the Large Hadron Collider and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. Furthermore, our parameterization is applicable to other phenomenological studies.</p>

<p>2024-04-25, <strong>Neutrino many-body flavor evolution: the full Hamiltonian</strong>, Vincenzo Cirigliano et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16690v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.16690v1</a></p>

<p>We study neutrino flavor evolution in the quantum many-body approach using the full neutrino-neutrino Hamiltonian, including the usually neglected terms that mediate non-forward scattering processes. Working in the occupation number representation with plane waves as single-particle states, we explore the time evolution of simple initial states with up to $N=10$ neutrinos. We discuss the time evolution of the Loschmidt echo, one body flavor and kinetic observables, and the one-body entanglement entropy. For the small systems considered, we observe `thermalization’ of both flavor and momentum degrees of freedom on comparable time scales, with results converging towards expectation values computed within a microcanonical ensemble. We also observe that the inclusion of non-forward processes generates a faster flavor evolution compared to the one induced by the truncated (forward) Hamiltonian.</p>

<p>2024-04-25, <strong>Understanding small neutrino mass and its implication</strong>, Hsiang-nan Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16626v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.16626v1</a></p>

<p>We have derived previously the relations between the neutrino masses and mixing angles in a dispersive analysis on the mixing of neutral leptonic states. The only involved assumption is that the electroweak symmetry of the Standard Model (SM) is restored at a high energy scale in some new physics scenario, which diminishes the box diagrams responsible for the mixing. Here we include corrections to the analysis up to three loops, arising from exchanges of additional neutral and charged scalars in the electroweak symmetric phase. The solution to the dispersion relation for the $\mu^-e^+$-$\mu^+e^-$ mixing generates a typical neutrino mass $m_\nu\sim O(1)$ eV in the SM unambiguously. The solution also favors the normal ordering of the neutrino masses over the inverted one, and links the large electroweak symmetry restoration, i.e., new physics scale to the small neutrino mass.</p>

<p>2024-04-25, <strong>Quantum effects on the evaporation of PBHs: contributions to dark matter</strong>, Md Riajul Haque et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16815v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.16815v1</a></p>

<p>We compute the relic abundance of dark matter in the presence of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) beyond the semiclassical approximation. We take into account the quantum corrections due to the memory burden effect, which is assumed to suppress the black hole evaporation rate by the inverse power of its own entropy. Such quantum effect significantly enhances the lifetime, rendering the possibility of PBH mass $\lesssim 10^{9}$ g being the sole dark matter (DM) candidate. However, Nature can not rule out the existence of fundamental particles such as DM. We, therefore, include the possibility of populating the dark sector by the decay of PBHs to those fundamental particles, adding the contribution to stable PBH whose lifetime is extended due to the quantum corrections. Depending on the strength of the burden effect, we show that a wide range of parameter space opens up in the initial PBH mass and fundamental dark matter mass plane that respects the correct relic abundance.</p>

<p>2024-04-25, <strong>Illuminating Black Hole Shadow with Dark Matter Annihilation</strong>, Yifan Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16673v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.16673v1</a></p>

<p>The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has revolutionized our ability to study black holes by providing unprecedented spatial resolution and unveiling horizon-scale details. With advancements leading to the next-generation EHT, there is potential to probe even deeper into the black hole’s dark region, especially the inner shadow characterized by low-intensity foreground emissions from the jet, thanks to a significant enhancement in dynamic range by two orders of magnitude. We demonstrate how such enhanced observations could transform supermassive black holes into powerful probes for detecting annihilating dark matter, which can form a dense profile in the vicinity of supermassive black holes, by examining the morphology of the black hole image.</p>

<p>2024-04-25, <strong>Gauged Q-ball dark matter through a cosmological first-order phase transition</strong>, Siyu Jiang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16509v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.16509v1</a></p>

<p>As a new type of dynamical dark matter mechanism, we discuss the stability of the gauged Q-ball dark matter and its production mechanism through a cosmological first-order phase transition. This work delves into the study of gauged Q-ball dark matter generated during the cosmic phase transition. We demonstrate detailed discussions on the stability of gauged Q-balls to rigorously constrain their charge and mass ranges. Additionally, employing analytic approximations and the mapping method, we provide qualitative insights of gauged Q-ball. We establish an upper limit on the gauge coupling constant and give the relic density of stable gauged Q-ball dark matter formed during a first-order phase transition. Furthermore, we discuss potential observational signatures or constraints of gauged Q-ball dark matter, including astronomical observations and gravitational wave signals.</p>

<p>2024-04-25, <strong>Model independent approach for calculating galaxy rotation curves for low $S/N$ MaNGA galaxies</strong>, Sangwoo Park et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16401v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.16401v1</a></p>

<p>Internal kinematics of galaxies, traced through the stellar rotation curve or two dimensional velocity map, carry important information on galactic structure and dark matter. With upcoming surveys, the velocity map may play a key role in the development of kinematic lensing as an astrophysical probe. We improve techniques for extracting velocity information from integral field spectroscopy at low signal-to-noise ($S/N$), without a template, and demonstrate substantial advantages over the standard Penalized PiXel-Fitting method (pPXF) approach. We note that Robust rotation curves can be derived down to $S/N\approx 2$ using our method.</p>

<p>2024-04-25, <strong>Heavy Dark Matter in White Dwarfs: Multiple-Scattering Capture and Thermalization</strong>, Nicole F. Bell et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16272v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.16272v1</a></p>

<p>We present an improved treatment for the scattering of heavy dark matter from the ion constituents of a white dwarf. In the heavy dark matter regime, multiple collisions are required for the dark matter to become gravitationally captured. Our treatment incorporates all relevant physical effects including the dark matter trajectories, nuclear form factors, and radial profiles for the white dwarf escape velocity and target number densities. Our capture rates differ by orders of magnitude from previous estimates, which have typically used approximations developed for dark matter scattering in the Earth. We also compute the time for the dark matter to thermalize in the center of the white dwarf, including in-medium effects such as phonon emission and absorption from the ionic lattice in the case where the star has a crystallized core. We find much shorter thermalization timescales than previously estimated, especially if the white dwarf core has crystallized. We illustrate the importance of our improved approach by determining the cross section required for accumulated asymmetric dark matter to self-gravitate.</p>

<h1 id="supernova-2">supernova (2)</h1>

<p>2024-04-25, <strong>STELLA lightcurves of energetic pair instability supernovae in the context of SN2018ibb</strong>, Chris Nagele et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16570v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.16570v1</a></p>

<p>SN2018ibb is a recently observed hydrogen poor super-luminous supernova which appears to be powered by the decay of $30\;\rm{M_\odot}$ of radioactive nickel. This supernova has been suggested to show hybrid signatures of a pair instability supernova and an interacting supernova. In a previous paper, we found that rotating, metal enriched pair instability supernova progenitors appeared to check both of these boxes. In this paper, we model the lightcurves of the pair instability supernovae using STELLA. We find that the STELLA models can explain the overall shape of the bolometric lightcurve of SN2018ibb, though not specific morphological features such as the luminosity peak or the bump at roughly three hundred days after the peak. We also estimate the contribution from interaction, and find that with relatively low wind velocities, the circum-stellar medium originating from the stellar winds is consistent with the evidence for interaction in the spectra. The observed values of the photosphere velocity in the hundred days after peak luminosity are similar to the STELLA models, but the deceleration is lower. This leads to the biggest inconsistency which is the black body temperature of SN2018ibb being much hotter than any of the STELLA models. We note that this high temperature (and the flat velocity) may be difficult to reconcile with the long rise time of SN2018ibb, but nevertheless conclude that if it is accurate, this discrepancy represents a challenge for SN2018ibb being a robust PISN candidate. This result is noteworthy given the lack of other scenarios for this supernova.</p>

<p>2024-04-25, <strong>Reconstructing Cosmic History: JWST-Extended Mapping of the Hubble Flow from z$ \sim $0 to z$ \sim$7.5 with HII Galaxies</strong>, Ricardo Chávez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16261v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.16261v1</a></p>

<p>Over twenty years ago, Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) [arXiv:astro-ph/9805201, arXiv:astro-ph/9812133] observations revealed an accelerating Universe expansion, suggesting a significant dark energy presence, often modelled as a cosmological constant, $\Lambda$. Despite its pivotal role in cosmology, the standard $\Lambda$CDM model remains largely underexplored in the redshift range between distant SNIa and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This study harnesses the James Webb Space Telescope’s advanced capabilities to extend the Hubble flow mapping across an unprecedented redshift range, from $z \approx 0$ to $z \approx 7.5$. Utilising a dataset of 231 HII galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, we employ the $\text{L}-\sigma$ relation, correlating the luminosity of Balmer lines with their velocity dispersion, to define a competitive technique for measuring cosmic distances. This approach maps the Universe’s expansion over more than 12 billion years, covering 95\% of its age. Our analysis, using Bayesian inference, constrains the parameter space $\lbrace h, \Omega_m, w_0\rbrace = \lbrace 0.731\pm0.039, 0.302^{+0.12}_{-0.069}, -1.01^{+0.52}_{-0.29}\rbrace $ (statistical) for a flat Universe. These results provide new insights into cosmic evolution and suggest uniformity in the photo-kinematical properties of young massive ionizing clusters in giant HII regions and HII galaxies across most of the Universe’s history.</p>
