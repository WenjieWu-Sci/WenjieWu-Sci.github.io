<p>2024-01-30, <strong>Post-inflationary Dark Matter production and Leptogenesis: Metric versus Palatini formalism</strong>, Anish Ghoshal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17262v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.17262v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate production of non-thermal dark matter particle and heavy sterile neutrino from inflaton during the reheating era which is preceded by a slow-roll inflationary epoch with a quartic potential and non-minimal coupling ($\xi$) between the inflaton and the gravity. We compare our analysis between metric and Palatini formalism. For the latter with $\xi=0.5$ and number of $e$-folds $\sim 60$, $r$ can be as small as $\sim {\cal O}\left(10^{-3}\right)$ which may be validated at $1-\sigma$ CL of prospective future reaches of upcoming CMB observation such as CMB-S4~etc. We identify that permissible range of Yukawa coupling $y_\chi$ between inflaton and fermionic DM $\chi$, to be ${\cal O}\left(10^{-3.5}\right)\gtrsim y_\chi \gtrsim {\cal O}\left(10^{-20}\right)$ for metric formalism and ${\cal O}\left(10^{-4}\right)\gtrsim y_\chi \gtrsim {\cal O}\left(10^{-11}\right)$ for Palatini formalism which is consistent with current PLANCK data and also be within the reach of future CMB experiments. For the scenario of leptogenesis via the decay of sterile neutrino produced from inflaton decay, we also investigate the parameter space of heavy neutrino mass $m_{N_1}$ and Yukawa coupling $y_{N_1}$ of sterile neutrino with inflaton, which are consistent with current CMB data and successful generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis. In contrast to metric formalism, in the case of Palatini formalism for successful leptogenesis to occur we find that $y_{N_1}$ has a very narrow allowable range and is severely constrained from the consistency with CMB predictions.</p>

<p>2024-01-30, <strong>NuTag: proof-of-concept study for a long-baseline neutrino beam</strong>, Anna Baratto-Roldán et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17068v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.17068v1</a></p>

<p>The study of neutrino oscillation at accelerators is limited by systematic uncertainties, in particular on the neutrino flux, cross-section, and energy estimates. These systematic uncertainties could be eliminated by a novel experimental technique: neutrino tagging. This technique relies on a new type of neutrino beamline and its associated instrumentation which would enable the kinematical reconstruction of the neutrinos produced in $\pi^{\pm} \to \mu^{\pm} \nu_\mu$ and $K^{\pm} \to \mu^{\pm} \nu_\mu$ decays. This article presents a proof-of-concept study for such a tagged beamline, aiming to serve a long baseline neutrino experiment exploiting a megaton scale natural water Cherenkov detector. After optimizing the target and the beamline optics to first order, a complete Monte Carlo simulation of the beamline has been performed. The results show that the beamline provides a meson beam compatible with the operation of the spectrometer, and delivers a neutrino flux sufficient to collect neutrino samples with a size comparable with similar experiments and with other un-tagged long-baseline neutrino experimental proposals.</p>

<p>2024-01-30, <strong>Impact of Hot Inner Crust on The Properties of Hot Compact Stars</strong>, Clara Dehman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16957v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.16957v1</a></p>

<p>We have conducted a study on the thermal properties of the recently developed nuclear energy density functional known as BCPM. This functional is founded on microscopic calculations that incorporate the realistic Argonne $v_{18}$ potential along with Urbana-type three-body forces. BCPM has demonstrated success in describing finite nuclei and cold neutron stars. However, investigating the properties of hot $\beta$-stable matter under both neutrino-free and neutrino-trapped scenarios is vital for astrophysical applications. In this study, we investigate the BCPM equation of state for $\beta$-stable, neutrino-free matter at finite temperatures, taking into consideration the hot inner crust and applying the frozen correlation approximation. Such an equation of state holds significant importance for hot compact objects, such as the final result of a binary neutron star merger event. Our exploration has unveiled the presence of cluster regions, persisting up to a temperature of approximately $7.2$ MeV, denoted as the limiting temperature. Beyond this limiting temperature, clusters are not anticipated to manifest. At temperatures below the limiting threshold, clusters within the inner crust are encompassed by uniform matter with varying densities, facilitating the distinction between the higher and lower transition density branches. Furthermore, we have computed mass-radius relationship, while assuming an isothermal profile for neutron star matter at diverse temperature values. Our findings indicate that the results of the hot inner crust substantially influences the mass-radius relationship, resulting in the formation of larger, more inflated neutron stars. A thorough analysis of the hot inner crust is therefore essential for the study of proto-neutron stars.</p>

<p>2024-01-30, <strong>Revisiting series expansions of neutrino oscillation and decay probabilities in matter</strong>, Jesper Grönroos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16864v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.16864v1</a></p>

<p>We present analytic expressions for three-flavor neutrino oscillations in presence of invisible neutrino decay and matter effects. Using the well-known Cayley-Hamilton formalism, the leading-order terms are derived for oscillation probabilities in all major channels assuming the neutrino mass eigenstate $\nu_3$ to decay into sterile neutrinos. Our work extends and complements previous studies utilizing the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, providing the series expansions for $\nu_e \rightarrow \nu_e$, $\nu_e \rightarrow \nu_\mu$, $\nu_e \rightarrow \nu_\tau$, $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\mu$, $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\tau$ and $\nu_\tau \rightarrow \nu_\tau$. The accuracy of the analytical formulas is investigated by comparing the results with numerically calculated probabilities. We also comment on the implications on unitarity violation.</p>

<p>2024-01-30, <strong>Constraining Particle Dark Matter with eROSITA Early Data</strong>, Chingam Fong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16747v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.16747v1</a></p>

<p>Many well motivated dark matter (DM) particle candidates can decay into detectable X-ray photons. We analyze eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) from eROSITA early data release to search for unexplained X-ray lines that could indicate DM signal. Having discovered no extra line, we set limits on DM decay rate in mass range between 1.8-18 keV, and constrain the parameter space of two DM particles: sterile neutrino and axion-like particles. Finally we also study the projected sensitivity of eROSITA full sky search, showing that eROSITA all-sky survey is expected to set the most stringent limits in the soft X-ray band.</p>

<p>2024-01-30, <strong>Dark Matter Searches on a Photonic Chip</strong>, Nikita Blinov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17260v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.17260v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter (DM) with masses of order an electronvolt or below can have a non-zero coupling to electromagnetism. In these models, the ambient DM behaves as a new classical source in Maxwell’s equations, which can excite potentially detectable electromagnetic (EM) fields in the laboratory. We describe a new proposal for using integrated photonics to search for such DM candidates with masses in the 0.1 eV - few eV range. This approach offers a wide range of wavelength-scale devices like resonators and waveguides that can enable a novel and exciting experimental program. In particular, we show how refractive index-modulated resonators, such as grooved or periodically-poled microrings, or patterned slabs, support EM modes with efficient coupling to DM. When excited by the DM, these modes can be read out by coupling the resonators to a waveguide that terminates on a micron-scale-sized single photon detector, such as a single pixel of an ultra-quiet charge-coupled device or a superconducting nanowire. We then estimate the sensitivity of this experimental concept in the context of axion-like particle and dark photon models of DM, showing that the scaling and confinement advantages of nanophotonics may enable exploration of new DM parameter space.</p>

<p>2024-01-30, <strong>Spectrum of global string networks and the axion dark matter mass</strong>, Ken’ichi Saikawa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17253v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.17253v1</a></p>

<p>Cold dark matter axions produced in the post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking scenario serve as clear targets for their experimental detection, since it is in principle possible to give a sharp prediction for their mass once we understand precisely how they are produced from the decay of global cosmic strings in the early Universe. In this paper, we perform a dedicated analysis of the spectrum of axions radiated from strings based on large scale numerical simulations of the cosmological evolution of the Peccei-Quinn field on a static lattice. Making full use of the massively parallel code and computing resources, we executed the simulations with up to $11264^3$ lattice sites, which allows us to improve our understanding of the dependence on the parameter controlling the string tension and thus give a more accurate extrapolation of the numerical results. We found that there are several systematic effects that have been overlooked in previous works, such as the dependence on the initial conditions, contaminations due to oscillations in the spectrum, and discretisation effects, some of which could explain the discrepancy in the literature. We confirmed the trend that the spectral index of the axion emission spectrum increases with the string tension, but did not find a clear evidence of whether it continues to increase or saturates to a constant at larger values of the string tension due to the severe discretisation effects. Taking this uncertainty into account and performing the extrapolation with a simple power law assumption on the spectrum, we find that the dark matter mass is predicted in the range of $m_a \approx 95$-$450\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$.</p>

<p>2024-01-30, <strong>Ultralight scalar and axion dark matter detection with atom interferometers</strong>, Wei Zhao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17055v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.17055v1</a></p>

<p>The detection of dark matter is a challenging problem in modern physics. The ultralight scalar and axion dark matter could induce the oscillation of the nuclear charge radii and then oscillate the atomic transition frequency by interacting with standard model particles. We compute the differential phase shift caused by the scalar and axion dark matter in a pair of separated atom interferometers and give the proposed constraints on the scalar dark matter coupling parameters $d_g$ and $d_{\hat{m}}$ as well as the axion dark matter coupling parameter $1/f_a$. Our results are expected to improve the current detection level and complement with other experiments.</p>

<p>2024-01-30, <strong>Production of ultralight dark matter from inflationary spectator fields</strong>, Alessio Belfiglio et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16910v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.16910v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate inflationary particle production associated with a spectator ultralight scalar field, which has been recently proposed as a plausible dark matter candidate. In this framework, we select the Starobinsky potential to drive the inflationary epoch, also discussing the case of a nonminimally coupled inflaton field fueled by a quartic symmetry-breaking potential. We focus on particle production arising from spacetime perturbations, which are induced by inflaton fluctuations during the quasi-de Sitter stage of inflation. In particular, we construct the first order Lagrangian describing interaction between inhomogeneities and the spectator field, quantifying superhorizon particle production during slow-roll. We then compare this mechanism with gravitational particle production associated with an instantaneous transition from inflation to the radiation dominated era. We show that the amount of particles obtained from perturbations is typically non-negligible and it is significantly enhanced on super-Hubble scales by the nonadiabatic inflationary expansion. Possible implications for primordial entanglement generation are also debated.</p>

<p>2024-01-30, <strong>Emulating dark energy models with known EoS via the CCDM scenario</strong>, Víctor H. Cárdenas et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16905v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.16905v1</a></p>

<p>In this work we establish the analog at background level between the Created Cold Dark Matter (CCDM) model and diverse dark energy (DE) models. We find that for a barotropic or linear equation of state (EoS) for the DE, $p=w \rho$, and standard matter sector the corresponding CCDM model is described by the same functional structure of the ratio of particle production, $\Gamma$. For a different EoS the functional form of the $\Gamma$ term is not longer maintained, however, in the case of a polytropic EoS given by the Chaplygin gas the resulting $\Gamma$ term can be written as the one obtained in the barotropic case under certain considerations.</p>

<p>2024-01-30, <strong>Study of X-ray emission from the S147 nebula with SRG/eROSITA: X-ray imaging, spectral characterization and a multiwavelength picture</strong>, Miltiadis Michailidis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17312v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.17312v1</a></p>

<p>Simeis 147 (S147, G180.0-01.7, ``Spaghetti nebula’’) is a supernova remnant (SNR) extensively studied across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to GeV $\gamma$-rays, except in X-rays. In this study, we report the first detection of significant X-ray emission from the entire SNR. Here, and in a companion paper, we present studies of X-ray emission from the S147 nebula using the data of the extended ROentgen Survey Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) onboard the Russian-German Spektrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG). The object is located at the Galactic anti-center, and its 3 deg size classifies it among the largest SNRs ever detected in X-rays. Overall, the X-ray emission morphology as observed with eROSITA is fully confined within the boundaries of both radio synchrotron and H$\alpha$ emission, except for the Western edge of the remnant where radio and H$\alpha$ emission appears to extend further to the West compared to X-rays. The X-ray emission is predominantly soft with a strong detection between 0.5-1.0 keV, leaving S147 undetected above 2.3 keV. The X-ray emission is purely thermal, exhibiting strong O, Ne, and Mg lines, whereas it lacks heavier-Z elements. A model of non-equilibrium collisional plasma, with a gas temperature of $kT=0.22^{-0.03}_{+0.02}$~keV, and an absorption column density of $N_\mathrm=0.30_{-0.03}^{+0.04}\cdot10^{22}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ ($\tau=4.27^{+1.87}_{-0.99}~\mathrm{\cdot10^{10}s~ cm^{-3}}$), is preferred over a collisional plasma model in equilibrium with $kT=0.11\pm0.01$~keV and with $N_\mathrm=0.51\pm0.02\cdot10^{22}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. By employing $\sim$14.5 years of Fermi-LAT data, our study confirms the association of the remnant with a spatially coincident diffuse GeV excess, namely 4FGL J0540.3+2756e or FGES J0537.6+2751. Age and distance estimates of the remnant are also reported based on the eROSITA data.</p>

<p>2024-01-30, <strong>X-ray counterpart detection and gamma-ray analysis of the SNR G279.0+01.1 with eROSITA and Fermi-LAT</strong>, Miltiadis Michailidis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17311v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.17311v1</a></p>

<p>A thorough inspection of known Galactic Supernova Remnants (SNRs) along the Galactic plane with SRG/eROSITA yielded the detection of the X-ray counterpart of the SNR G279.0+01.1. The SNR is located just 1.5 deg above the Galactic plane. Its X-ray emission emerges as an incomplete, partial shell of $\sim$3 deg angular extension. It is strongly correlated to the fragmented shell-type morphology of its radio continuum emission. The X-ray spatial morphology of the SNR seems to be linked to the presence of dust clouds in the surroundings. The majority of its X-ray emission is soft (exhibiting strong O, Ne and Mg lines), and occurs in a narrow range of energies between 0.3 and 1.5 keV. Above 2.0 keV the remnant remains undetected. The remnant’s X-ray spectrum is of purely thermal nature. Constraining the X-ray absorption column to values which are consistent with optical extinction data from the remnant’s location favours non-equilibrium over equilibrium models. A non-equilibrium two-temperature plasma model of $\mathrm{kT}\sim0.3$~keV and $\mathrm{kT}\sim0.6$~keV, and an absorption column density of $\mathrm{N_{H}}\sim0.3~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ describes the spectrum of the entire remnant well. Significant temperature variations across the remnant have been detected. Employing 14.5 years of Fermi-LAT data, we carried out a comprehensive study of the extended GeV source 4FGL J1000.0-5312e. By refining and properly modeling the GeV excess originating from the location of the remnant, we conclude that the emission is likely related to the remnant itself rather than being co-located by chance. We also discuss implications of the new X-ray data to the estimates of the distance and age of the remnant.</p>

<p>2024-01-30, <strong>First Study of the Supernova Remnant Population in the Large Magellanic Cloud with eROSITA</strong>, Federico Zangrandi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17307v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.17307v1</a></p>

<p>The study of the entire population of SNRs in a galaxy helps us to understand the underlying stellar populations, the environments, in which the SNRs are evolving, and the stellar feedback on the ISM. The all-sky survey carried out by the extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (Spektr-RG, SRG) has provided us with spatially and spectrally resolved X-ray data of the entire Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and its immediate surroundings in the soft X-ray band down to 0.2 keV. We performed a multiwavelength analysis of previously known SNR candidates and newly detected SNRs and SNR candidates. We applied the Gaussian gradient magnitude (GGM) filter to the eROSITA images of the LMC to highlight the edges of the shocked gas in order to find new SNRs. We compared the X-ray images with those of their optical and radio counterparts to investigate the true nature of the extended emission. We used the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey (MCELS) for the optical data. For the radio comparison, we used data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) survey of the LMC. Using the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds (VMC) we have investigated the possible progenitors of the new SNRs and SNR candidates in our sample. We present the most updated catalogue of SNRs in the LMC. The eROSITA data have allowed us to confirm two of the previous SNR candidates and discover 16 new extended sources. We confirm 3 of them as new SNRs, while we propose the remaining 13 as new X-ray SNR candidates. We also present the first analysis of the follow-up XMM-Newton observation of MCSNR J0456-6533 discovered with eROSITA. Among the new candidates, we propose J0614-7251 (4eRASSU J061438.1-725112) as the first X-ray SNR candidate in the outskirts of the LMC.</p>

<p>Detecting a supernova remnant (SNR) along the Galactic plane can be quite challenging. Any new detection reduces the discrepancy between the expected and known number of remnants. In this paper, we present results from a large selection of radio and X-ray data that cover the position of G321.3-3.9. We identified G321.3-3.9 as a new SNR using data collected by several radio surveys spanning a frequency range from 200 MHz to 2300 MHz. Stacked eROSITA data from four consecutive all-sky surveys (eRASS:4) provide spectro-imaging information in the energy band 0.2-8.0 keV. G321.3-3.9 has an elliptical shape with major and minor axes of about 1.7 deg x 1.1 deg. From CHIPASS and S-PASS data, we calculate a spectral index -0.8 +- 0.4, consistent with synchrotron emission from an expanding shell in the Sedov Taylor phase. The eROSITA data show an X-ray diffuse structure filling almost the entire radio shell. Depending on the tested spectral model, a plasma temperature between 0.2 keV (VAPEC) and 0.7 keV (NEI) can be fit. The X-ray spectral analysis allowed us to estimate the column absorption towards G321.3-3.9, which suggests a remnant distance of about 1 kpc by comparison with optical extinction maps.</p>

<p>A dozen of patches of polarized radio emission spanning tens of degrees in the form of coherent and stationary loops are observed at radio frequencies across the sky. Their origin is usually associated to nearby shocks, possibly arising from close supernovae explosions. The origin of the radio Loop XII remains so far unknown. We report an anti-correlation of the radio polarized emission of loop XII with a large patch of soft X-ray emission found with SRG/eROSITA in excess of the background surface brightness, in the same region. The soft X-ray seemingly coherent patch in excess of the background emission, which we dub as the Goat Horn complex, extends over a remarkable area of $\sim 1000$ deg$^2$ and includes an arc-shaped enhancement potentially tracing a cold front. An anti-correlation of the X-ray intensity with the temperature of the plasma responsible for the X-ray emission is also observed. The X-ray bright arc seems to anticipate the radio loop XII by some degrees on the sky. This behavior can be recast in terms of a correlation between X-ray surface brightness and radio depolarization. We explore and discuss different possible scenarios for the source of the diffuse emission in the Goat Horn complex: a large supernova remnant; an outflow from active star formation regions in nearby Galactic spiral arms; a hot atmosphere around the Large Magellanic Cloud. In order to probe these scenarios further, a more detailed characterization on the velocity of the hot gas is required.</p>

<p>The Gemini-Monoceros X-ray enhancement is a rich field for studying diffuse X-ray emission and supernova remnants (SNRs). With the launch of eROSITA onboard the SRG platform in 2019, we are now able to fully study these sources. Many of the SNRs in the vicinity are suspected to be very old remnants, which are severely understudied in X-rays due to numerous observational challenges. In addition, identification of new faint large SNRs might help to solve the long-standing discrepancy of observed and expected number of Galactic SNRs.   We performed a detailed X-ray spectral analysis of the entire diffuse structure and a detailed background analysis of the vicinity. We also made use of multi-wavelength data to better understand the morphology and to constrain the distances to the different sources. We estimated the plasma properties of the sources and calculated a grid of model SNRs to determine the individual SNR properties.   Most of the diffuse plasma of the Monogem Ring SNR is well described by a single non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) component with an average temperature of $kT = 0.14\pm 0.03$ keV. We obtain an age of $\approx 1.2\cdot 10^5$ yr - consistent with PSR B0656+14 - for the Monogem Ring. In the south-east, we found evidence for a hotter second plasma component and a possible new SNR candidate at $\approx 300$ pc, with the new candidate having an age of $\approx 50,000$ yr. We were also able to improve on previous studies on the more distant Monoceros Loop and PKS 0646+06 SNRs. We obtained significantly higher temperatures than previous studies, and for PKS 0646+06 a much lower estimated age of the SNR. We also found a new SNR candidate G190.4+12.5 which most likely is located at $D &gt; 1.5 $ kpc, expanding into a low density medium at a high distance from the Galactic plane, with an estimated age of $40,000-60,000$ yr.</p>

<p>The Simeis~147 nebula (S147), particularly well known for a spectacular net of ${\rm H}_\alpha$-emitting filaments, is often considered one of the largest and oldest known supernova remnants in the Milky Way. Here, and in a companion paper, we present studies of X-ray emission from the S147 nebula using the data of SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey observations. In this paper, we argue that many inferred properties of the X-ray emitting gas are broadly consistent with a scenario of the supernova explosion in a low-density cavity, e.g. a wind-blown-bubble. This scenario assumes that a $\sim 20\,{\rm M_\odot}$ progenitor star has had small velocity with respect to the ambient ISM, so it stayed close to the center of a dense shell created during its Main Sequence evolution till the moment of the core-collapse explosion. The ejecta first propagate through the low-density cavity until they collide with the dense shell, and only then the reverse shock goes deeper into the ejecta and powers the observed X-ray emission of the nebula. The part of the remnant inside the dense shell remains non-radiative till now and, plausibly, in a state with $T_e&lt;T_i$ and Non-Equilibrium Ionization (NEI). On the contrary, the forward shock becomes radiative immediately after entering the dense shell, and, being subject to instabilities, creates a characteristic “foamy” appearance of the nebula in ${\rm H}_\alpha$ and radio emission.</p>

<p>Since the discovery of synchrotron X-ray emission from the shell of the supernova remnant (SNR) SN 1006, multiple observations from Chandra and XMM-Newton have shown that many young SNRs produce synchrotron emission in X-rays. Among those, a few peculiar SNRs have their X-ray emission largely dominated by synchrotron radiation, showing no or only faint traces of thermal emission. In this paper, we report our mapping of the thermal emission in three emblematic synchrotron-dominated SNRs: G330.2+1.0, 3C58, and RX J1713.7-3946. We used a blind source separation method able to retrieve faint components from X-ray data in the form of Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. The thermal candidates disentangled by the algorithm were then used to select regions of extraction. We then analyzed the extracted spectra to assess their physical nature. We conclude that the components retrieved by the algorithm indeed represent the spatial distribution of the thermal emission in G330.2+1.0 and 3C58, and a likely thermal candidate in RX J1713.7-3946. Our findings confirm and expand on past studies.</p>

<p>2024-01-30, <strong>Collapsing massive stars and their EM transients</strong>, Agnieszka Janiuk et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17156v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.17156v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the fate of a collapsing stellar core, which is the final state of evolution of a massive, rotating star of a Wolf-Rayet type. Such stars explode as type I b/c supernovae, which have been observed in association with long gamma ray bursts (GRBs). The core of the star is potentially forming a black hole, which is embedded in a dense, rotating, and possibly highly magnetized envelope. We study the process of collapse using General Relativistic MHD simulations, and we account for the growth of the black hole mass and its spin, as well as related evolution of the spacetime metric. We find that some particular configurations of the initial black hole spin, the content of angular momentum in the stellar core, and the magnetic field configuration and its strength, are favored for producing a bright electromagnetic transient (i.e., a gamma ray burst). On the other hand, most of the typical configurations studied in our models do not lead to a transient electromagnetic explosion and will end up in a direct collapse, accompanied by some residual variability induced by changing accretion rate. We also study the role of self-gravity in the stellar core and quantify the relative strength of the interfacial instabilities, such as Self-Gravity Interfacial (SGI) instability and Rayleigh-Taylor (RT), which may account for the production of an inhomogeneous structure, including spikes and bubbles, through the inner radii of the collapsing core (inside $\sim 200~r_{g}$). %Furthermore, we investigate the axisymmetric modes of gravitational instability based on the generalized Toomre parameter. We find that in self-gravitating collapsars the RT modes cannot grow efficiently. We also conclude that transonic shocks are formed in the collapsing envelope, but they are weaker in magnetized stars.</p>

<p>We investigate the prospect of reconstructing the ``cosmic distance ladder’’ of the Universe using a novel deep learning framework called LADDER - Learning Algorithm for Deep Distance Estimation and Reconstruction. LADDER is trained on the apparent magnitude data from the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae compilation, incorporating the full covariance information among data points, to produce predictions along with corresponding errors. After employing several validation tests with a number of deep learning models, we pick LADDER as the best performing one. We then demonstrate applications of our method in the cosmological context, that include serving as a model-independent tool for consistency checks for other datasets like baryon acoustic oscillations, calibration of high-redshift datasets such as gamma ray bursts, use as a model-independent mock catalog generator for future probes, etc. Our analysis advocates for interesting yet cautious consideration of machine learning applications in these contexts.</p>

<p>Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) as a standard candle is an ideal tool to measure cosmic distance and expansion history of the Universe. Here we investigate the SN Ia photometric measurement in the China Space Station Telescope Ultra Deep Field (CSST-UDF) survey, and study the constraint power on the cosmological parameters, such as the equation of state of dark energy. The CSST-UDF survey is expected to cover a 9 deg$^2$ sky area in two years with 60 exposures. The magnitude limit can reach $i\simeq26$ AB mag for 5$\sigma$ point source detection. We generate light curve mock data for SNe Ia and different types of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), based on the relevant SN SED templates, natural generation rates, luminosity functions, CSST instrumental design and survey strategy. After selecting high-quality data and fitting the light curves, we derive the light curve parameters and identify CCSNe as contamination, resulting in $\sim2200$ SNe with a $\sim7\%$ CCSN contamination rate. We adopt a calibration method similar to Chauvenet’s criterion, and apply it to the distance modulus data to further reduce the contamination. We find that this method is effective and can suppress the contamination fraction to $\sim3.5\%$ with 2012 SNe Ia and 73 CCSNe. About 16\% of SNe Ia are at $z&gt;1$ in the final CSST-UDF SN sample. By checking the cosmological constraints, the result derived from this calibrated SN sample is in good agreement with that using the pure SN Ia sample. The constraint accuracies on $\Omega_{\rm M}$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ and $w$ are about $10\%\sim20\%$, which is about two times better than the current SN surveys, and it could be further improved by a factor of $\sim$1.4 if including the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the CSST spectroscopic survey. This indicates that CSST can provide accurate measurements for the cosmic expansion history and the nature of dark energy.</p>

<p>2024-01-30, <strong>Toward Data-Driven Subgrid-Scale Modeling of the Zel’dovich Deflagration-To-Detonation Mechanism in Dense Stellar Plasmas</strong>, Brandon L. Gusto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16674v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.16674v1</a></p>

<p>A novel, data-driven model of deflagration-to-detonationtransition (DDT) is constructed for application to explosions of thermonuclear supernovae (SN Ia). The DDT mechanism has been suggested as the necessary physics process to obtain qualitative agreement between SN Ia observations and computational explosion models. This work builds upon a series of studies of turbulent combustion that develops during the final stages of the SN explosion. These studies suggest that DDT can occur in the turbulerized flame of the white dwarf via the Zel’dovich reactivity gradient mechanism when hotspots are formed. We construct a large database of direct numerical simulations that explore the parameter space of the Zel’dovich initiated detonation. We use this database to construct a neural network classifier for hotspots. The classifier is integrated into our supernova simulation code, FLASH/Proteus, and is used as the basis for a subgrid-scale model for DDT. The classifier is evaluated both in the training environment and in reactive turbulence simulations to verify its accuracy in realistic conditions.</p>
