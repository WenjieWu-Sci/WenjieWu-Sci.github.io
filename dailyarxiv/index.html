<p>2023-07-06, <strong>Where shadows lie: reconstruction of anisotropies in the neutrino sky</strong>, Willem Elbers et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03191v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.03191v1</a></p>

<p>The Cosmic Neutrino Background (CNB) encodes a wealth of information, but has not yet been observed directly. To determine the prospects of detection and to study its information content, we reconstruct the phase-space distribution of local relic neutrinos from the three-dimensional distribution of matter within 200 Mpc/h of the Milky Way. Our analysis relies on constrained realization simulations and forward modelling of the 2M++ galaxy catalogue. We find that the angular distribution of neutrinos is anti-correlated with the projected matter density, due to the capture and deflection of neutrinos by massive structures along the line of sight. Of relevance to tritium capture experiments, we find that the gravitational clustering effect of the large-scale structure on the local number density of neutrinos is more important than that of the Milky Way for neutrino masses less than 0.1 eV. Nevertheless, we predict that the density of relic neutrinos is close to the cosmic average, with a suppression or enhancement over the mean of (-0.3%, +7%, +27%) for masses of (0.01, 0.05, 0.1) eV. This implies no more than a marginal increase in the event rate for tritium capture experiments like PTOLEMY. We also predict that the CNB and CMB rest frames coincide for 0.01 eV neutrinos, but that neutrino velocities are significantly perturbed for masses larger than 0.05 eV. Regardless of mass, we find that the angle between the neutrino dipole and the ecliptic plane is small, implying a near-maximal annual modulation in the bulk velocity. Along with this paper, we publicly release our simulation data, comprising more than 100 simulations for six different neutrino masses.</p>

<p>2023-07-06, <strong>The split majoron model confronts the NANOGrav signal</strong>, Pasquale Di Bari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03184v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.03184v1</a></p>

<p>In the light of the evidence of a gravitational wave background from the NANOGrav 15yr data set, we reconsider the split majoron model as a new physics extension of the standard model able to generate a needed contribution to solve the current tension between the data and the standard interpretation in terms of inspiraling supermassive black hole massive binaries. In the split majoron model the seesaw right-handed neutrinos acquire Majorana masses from spontaneous symmetry breaking of global $U(1)_{B-L}$ in a strong first order phase transition of a complex scalar field occurring above the electroweak scale. The final vacuum expectation value couples to a second complex scalar field undergoing a low scale phase transition occurring after neutrino decoupling. Such a coupling enhances the strength of this second low scale first order phase transition and can generate a sizeable primordial gravitational wave background contributing to the NANOGrav 15yr signal. Moreover, the free streaming length of light neutrinos can be suppressed by their interactions with the resulting Majoron background and this can mildly ameliorate existing cosmological tensions, thus providing a completely independent motivation for the model.</p>

<p>2023-07-06, <strong>Neutrinos, Dark Matter and Higgs Vacua in Parity Solutions of the strong CP problem</strong>, Michele Redi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03161v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.03161v1</a></p>

<p>The strong CP problem can be solved if the laws of nature are invariant under a space-time parity exchanging the Standard Model with its mirror copy. We review and extend different realizations of this idea with the aim of discussing Dark Matter, neutrino physics, leptogenesis and collider physics within the same context. In the minimal realization of Ref. [1] the mirror world contains a massless dark photon, which leads to a rather interesting cosmology. Mirror electrons reproduce the dark matter abundance for masses between 500-1000 GeV with traces of strongly interacting dark matter. This scenario also predicts deviations from cold dark matter, sizable $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ and colored states in the TeV range that will be tested in a variety of upcoming experiments. We also explore scenarios where the mirror photon is massive and the mirror particles are charged under ordinary electro-magnetism with very different phenomenology. We also show that, for the measured values of the SM parameters, the Higgs effective potential can give rise to a second minimum at large field value as required to break spontaneously the parity symmetry.</p>

<p>2023-07-06, <strong>Supernova Limits on Muonic Dark Forces</strong>, Claudio Andrea Manzari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03143v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.03143v1</a></p>

<p>Proto-neutron stars formed during core-collapse supernovae are hot and dense environments that contain a sizable population of muons. If these interact with new long-lived particles with masses up to roughly 100 MeV, the latter can be produced and escape from the stellar plasma, causing an excessive energy loss constrained by observations of SN 1987A. In this article we calculate the emission of light dark fermions that are coupled to leptons via a new massive vector boson, and determine the resulting constraints on the general parameter space. We apply these limits to the gauged $L_\mu-L_\tau$ model with dark fermions, and show that the SN 1987A constraints exclude a significant portion of the parameter space targeted by future experiments. We also extend our analysis to generic effective four-fermion operators that couple dark fermions to muons, electrons, or neutrinos. We find that SN 1987A cooling probes a new-physics scale up to $\sim7$ TeV, which is an order of magnitude larger than current bounds from laboratory experiments.</p>

<p>2023-07-06, <strong>Measurement of ambient radon daughter decay rates and energy spectra in liquid argon using the MicroBooNE detector</strong>, MicroBooNE collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03102v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.03102v1</a></p>

<p>We report measurements of radon daughters in liquid argon within the MicroBooNE time projection chamber (LArTPC). The presence of radon in MicroBooNEâs 85 metric tons of active liquid argon bulk is probed with newly developed charge-based low-energy reconstruction tools and analysis techniques to detect correlated $^{214}$Bi-$^{214}$Po radioactive decays. Special datasets taken during periods of active radon doping enable new demonstrations of the calorimetric capabilities of single-phase neutrino LArTPCs for $\beta$ and $\alpha$ particles with electron-equivalent energies ranging from 0.1 to 3.0 MeV. By applying $^{214}$Bi-$^{214}$Po detection algorithms to beam-external physics data recorded over a 46-day period, no statistically significant presence of radon is detected, corresponding to a limit of $&lt;0.38$ mBq/kg at the 95\% confidence level. The obtained radon radiopurity limit â the first ever reported for a noble element detector incorporating liquid-phase purification â is well below the target value of the future DUNE neutrino detector.</p>

<p>2023-07-06, <strong>NANOGrav meets Hot New Early Dark Energy and the origin of neutrino mass</strong>, Juan S. Cruz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03091v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.03091v1</a></p>

<p>It has recently been speculated that the NANOGrav observations point towards a first-order phase transition in the dark sector at the GeV scale [1]. Here we show that such a high energy sibling of the New Early Dark Energy (NEDE) phase transition might already have been predicted in the Hot New Early Dark Energy model (Hot NEDE) [2, 3]. There, it was argued that the NEDE phase transition is a signature of neutrino mass generation through the inverse seesaw mechanism. Specifically, it serves a double purpose by resolving the Hubble tension through an energy injection and generating the Majorana mass entry in the inverse seesaw mixing matrix. In addition, the usual NEDE phase transition is accompanied by a UV counterpart, which generates the heavy Dirac mass entry in the inverse seesaw mass matrix of a right-handed neutrino. Here, we investigate if the UV phase transition of the Hot NEDE model can occur at the GeV scale in view of the recent NANOGrav observations.</p>

<p>2023-07-06, <strong>Constraining the cosmic-ray mass composition by measuring the shower length with SKA</strong>, S. Buitink et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02907v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.02907v1</a></p>

<p>The current generation of air shower radio arrays has demonstrated that the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum Xmax can be reconstructed with high accuracy. These experiments are now contributing to mass composition studies in the energy range where a transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic-ray sources is expected. However, we are still far away from an unambiguous interpretation of the data. Here we propose to use radio measurements to derive a new type of constraint on the mass composition, by reconstructing the shower length L. The low-frequency part of the Square Kilometer Array will have an extremely high antenna density of roughly 60.000 antennas within one square kilometer, and is the perfect site for high-resolution studies of air showers. In this contribution, we discuss the impact of being able to reconstruct L, and the unique contribution that SKA can make to cosmic-ray science.</p>

<p>2023-07-06, <strong>Decomposing the Origin of TeV-PeV Emission from the Galactic Plane: Implications of Multi-messenger Observations</strong>, Ke Fang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02905v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.02905v1</a></p>

<p>High-energy neutrino and $\gamma$-ray emission has been observed from the Galactic plane, which may come from individual sources and/or diffuse cosmic rays. We evaluate the contribution of these two components through the multi-messenger connection between neutrinos and $\gamma$ rays in hadronic interactions. We derive maximum fluxes of neutrino emission from the Galactic plane using $\gamma$-ray catalogs, including 4FGL, HGPS, 3HWC, and 1LHAASO, and measurements of the Galactic diffuse emission by Tibet AS$\gamma$ and LHAASO. We find that depending on model templates, the diffuse emission is brighter than the sum of resolved sources when excluding promising leptonic sources such as pulsars, pulsar wind nebulae, and TeV halos. Our result indicates that the Galactic neutrino emission observed by the IceCube Collaboration may be dominated by the Galactic diffuse emission or unresolved $\gamma$-ray sources. Future observations of neutrino telescopes and air-shower $\gamma$-ray experiments in the Southern hemisphere are needed to accurately disentangle the source and diffuse emission of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>2023-07-06, <strong>Effects of Hoyle state de-excitation on $Î½p$-process nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution</strong>, Hirokazu Sasaki et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02785v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.02785v1</a></p>

<p>The partcle-induced hadronic de-excitation of the Hoyle state in $^{12}$C induced by inelastic scattering in a hot and dense plasma can enhance the triple-alpha reaction rate. This prevents the production of heavy nuclei within the neutrino-driven winds of core-collapse supernovae and raises a question as to the contribution of proton-rich neutrino-driven winds as the origin of $p$-nuclei in the solar system abundances. Here we study $\nu p$-process nucleosynthesis in proton-rich neutrino-driven winds relevant to the production of $^{92,94}\mathrm{Mo}$ and $^{96,98}\mathrm{Ru}$ by considering such particle-induced de-excitation. We show that the enhancement of the triple-alpha reaction rate induced by neutron inelastic scattering hardly affects the $\nu p$-process, while the proton scattering contributes to the nucleosynthesis in proton-rich neutrino-driven winds at low temperature. The associated enhanced triple-alpha reaction rate decreases the production of $^{92,94}\mathrm{Mo}$ and $^{96,98}\mathrm{Ru}$ in a wind model of ordinary core-collapse supernovae. On the other hand, the abundances of these $p$-nuclei increase in an energetic hypernova wind model. Hence, we calculate the galactic chemical evolution of $^{92,94}\mathrm{Mo}$ and $^{96,98}\mathrm{Ru}$ by taking account of both contributions from core-collapse supernovae and hypernovae. We show that the hypernova $\nu p$-process can enhance the calculated solar isotopic fractions of $^{92,94}\mathrm{Mo}$ and $^{96,98}\mathrm{Ru}$ and make a significant impact on the GCE of $p$-nuclei regardless of the particle-induced Hoyle state de-excitation.</p>

<p>2023-07-05, <strong>Heavy neutral lepton corrections to SM boson decays: lepton flavour universality violation in low-scale seesaw realisations</strong>, A. Abada et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02558v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.02558v1</a></p>

<p>We study lepton flavour universality violation in SM boson decays in low-scale seesaw models of neutrino mass generation, also addressing other electroweak precision observables. We compute the electroweak next-to-leading order corrections, which turn out to be important - notably in the case of the invisible decay width of the $Z$ boson, for which the corrections can be as large as the current experimental uncertainty. As a well-motivated illustrative study case, we choose a realisation of the Inverse Seesaw mechanism, and discuss the complementary role of lepton flavour conserving, lepton flavour violating and precision observables, both in constraining and in probing such models of neutrino mass generation. Our findings suggest that invisible $Z$ decays are especially important, potentially at the origin of the most stringent constraints for certain regimes of the Inverse Seesaw (while complying with charge lepton flavour violation and other electroweak precision tests). We also discuss the probing power of the considered observables in view of the expected improvement in experimental precision at FCC-ee.</p>

<p>2023-07-05, <strong>Viscous hydrodynamic evolution of neutron star merger accretion disks: a code comparison</strong>, Rodrigo FernÃ¡ndez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02554v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.02554v1</a></p>

<p>The accretion disk formed after a neutron star merger is an important contributor to the total ejecta from the merger, and hence to the kilonova and the $r$-process yields of each event. Axisymmetric viscous hydrodynamic simulations of these disks can capture thermal mass ejection due to neutrino absorption and in the advective phase â after neutrino cooling has subsided â and are thus likely to provide a lower-limit to the total disk ejecta relative to MHD evolution. Here we present a comparison between two viscous hydrodynamic codes that have been used extensively on this problem over the past decade: ALCAR and FLASH. We choose a representative setup with a black hole at the center, and vary the treatment of viscosity and neutrino transport. We find good overall agreement ($\sim 10\%$ level) in most quantities. The average outflow velocity is sensitive to the treatment of the nuclear binding energy of heavy nuclei, showing a larger variation than other quantities. We post-process trajectories from both codes with the same nuclear network, and explore the effects of code differences on nucleosynthesis yields, heating rates, and kilonova light curves. For the latter, we also assess the effect of varying the number of tracer particles in reconstructing the spatial abundance distribution for kilonova light curve production.</p>

<p>2023-07-05, <strong>Searches for dark matter decay with ultra-high-energy neutrinos endure backgrounds</strong>, Damiano F. G. Fiorillo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02538v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.02538v1</a></p>

<p>Next-generation ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino telescopes, presently under planning, will have the potential to probe the decay of heavy dark matter (DM) into UHE neutrinos, with energies in excess of $10^7$~GeV. Yet, this potential may be deteriorated by the presence of an unknown background of UHE neutrinos, cosmogenic or from astrophysical sources, not of DM origin and seemingly large enough to obscure the DM signature. We show that leveraging the angular and energy distributions of detected events safeguards future searches for DM decay against such backgrounds. We focus on the radio-detection of UHE neutrinos in the planned IceCube-Gen2 neutrino telescope, which we model in state-of-the-art detail. We report promising prospects for the discovery potential of DM decay into UHE neutrinos, the measurement of DM mass and lifetime, and limits on the DM lifetime, despite the presence of a large background, without prior knowledge of its size and shape.</p>

<p>2023-07-05, <strong>A unified sedenion model for the origins of three generations of charged and neutral leptons, flavor mixing, mass oscillations and small masses of neutrinos</strong>, Qiang Tang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02505v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.02505v1</a></p>

<p>We present a unified model without the need for an ad hoc Standard Model hypothesis; we explain why there are three generations of charged and neutral leptons, why neutrinos have a vanishingly small mass, and why flavor-mixing emerges and mass oscillations occur. We show that the sedenion algebra contains three types of non-associative octonion algebra, with each corresponding to a generation of leptons. By incorporating extra degrees of freedom, the generalized higher dimensional Dirac equation accounts for the internal structural dynamics. This study sheds light on the intrinsic physical properties of three generations of charged leptons and neutrinos and their distinctive spacetime structures.</p>

<p>2023-07-05, <strong>$Î½^2$-Flows: Fast and improved neutrino reconstruction in multi-neutrino final states with conditional normalizing flows</strong>, John Andrew Raine et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02405v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.02405v1</a></p>

<p>In this work we introduce $\nu^2$-Flows, an extension of the $\nu$-Flows method to final states containing multiple neutrinos. The architecture can natively scale for all combinations of object types and multiplicities in the final state for any desired neutrino multiplicities. In $t\bar{t}$ dilepton events, the momenta of both neutrinos and correlations between them are reconstructed more accurately than when using the most popular standard analytical techniques, and solutions are found for all events. Inference time is significantly faster than competing methods, and can be reduced further by evaluating in parallel on graphics processing units. We apply $\nu^2$-Flows to $t\bar{t}$ dilepton events and show that the per-bin uncertainties in unfolded distributions is much closer to the limit of performance set by perfect neutrino reconstruction than standard techniques. For the chosen double differential observables $\nu^2$-Flows results in improved statistical precision for each bin by a factor of 1.5 to 2 in comparison to the Neutrino Weighting method and up to a factor of four in comparison to the Ellipse approach.</p>

<p>2023-07-05, <strong>Multi-messenger observations support cosmic ray interactions surrounding acceleration sources</strong>, Dong-Xu Sun et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02372v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.02372v1</a></p>

<p>The observations of the energy spectra of cosmic-ray have revealed complicated structures. Especially, spectral hardenings in the boron-to-carbon and boron-to-oxygen ratios above $\sim 200$ GV has been revealed by AMS-02 and DAMPE experiments. One scenario to account for the hardenings of secondary-to-primary ratios is the nuclear fragmentation of freshly accelerated particles around sources. In this work, we further study this scenario based on new observations of Galactic diffuse gamma rays by LHAASO and neutrinos by IceCube. We find that the spectra of cosmic ray nuclei, the diffuse ultra-high-energy gamma rays, and the Galactic component of neutrinos can be simultaneously explained, given an average confinement and interaction time of $\sim 0.25$ Myr around sources. These multi-messenger data thus provide evidence of non-negligible grammage of Galactic cosmic rays surrounding sources besides the traditional one during the propagation.</p>

<p>The active galaxy NGC 1068 was recently identified by the IceCube neutrino observatory as the first known steady-state, extragalactic neutrino point source, associated with about 79 events over ten years. We use the IceCube data to place limits on possible neutrino self-interactions mediated by scalar particles with mass between 1 - 10 MeV. We find that a flavor-specific $\nu_{\tau}$ self-interaction is constrained beyond existing published bounds, while a flavor-universal self-interaction is not.</p>

<p>The recent detection of high-energy neutrinos by IceCube in the direction of the nearby Seyfert/starburst galaxy NGC 1068 implies that radio-quiet active galactic nuclei can accelerate cosmic-ray ions. Dedicated multi-messenger analyses suggest that the interaction of these high-energy ions { with ambient gas or photons} happens in a region of the galaxy that is highly opaque for GeV-TeV gamma rays. Otherwise, the GeV-TeV emission would violate existing constraints provided by {\it Fermi}-LAT and MAGIC. The conditions of high optical depth are realized near the central super-massive black hole (SMBH). At the same time, the GeV emission detected by the {\it Fermi}-Large Area Telescope (LAT) is likely related to the galaxyâs sustained star-formation activity. In this work, we derive a 20\,MeV - 1\,TeV spectrum of NGC 1068 using 14\,yrs of {\it Fermi}-LAT observations. We find that the starburst hadronic component is responsible for NGC 1068âs emission above $\sim$500\,MeV. However, below this energy an additional component is required. In the 20-500\,MeV range the {\it Fermi}-LAT data are consistent with hadronic emission {initiated by non-thermal ions interacting with gas or photons} in the vicinity of the central SMBH. This highlights the importance of the MeV band to discover hidden cosmic-ray accelerators.</p>

<p>The advancement of neutrino observatories has sparked a surge in multi-messenger astronomy. Multiple neutrino associations among blazars are reported while neutrino production site is located within their central (sub)parsecs. Yet many questions remain on the nature of those processes. The next generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) is uniquely positioned for these studies, as its high frequency and resolution can probe both the accretion disk region and the parsec-scale jet. This opens up new opportunities for connecting the two regions and unraveling the proton acceleration and neutrino production in blazars. We outline observational strategies for ngEHT and highlight what it can contribute to the multi-messenger study of blazars.</p>

<p>Models that produce Axion-Like-Particles (ALP) after cosmological inflation due to spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking also produce cosmic string networks. Those axionic strings lose energy through gravitational wave emission during the whole cosmological history, generating a stochastic background of gravitational waves that spans many decades in frequency. We can therefore constrain the axion decay constant and axion mass from limits on the gravitational wave spectrum and compatibility with dark matter abundance as well as dark radiation. We derive such limits from analyzing the most recent NANOGrav data from Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA). The limits are compatible with the slightly stronger $N_{\rm eff}$ bounds on dark radiation for ALP masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV. On the other hand, for heavy ALPs with $m_a\gtrsim 0.1$ GeV and $N_{\rm DW}\neq 1$, new regions of parameter space can be probed by PTA data due to the dominant Domain-Wall contribution to the gravitational wave background.</p>

<p>We show that the baryon asymmetry of the Universe cannot be explained by a large initial value before inflation because it inevitably predicts correlated baryon isocurvature perturbations that are already excluded by cosmic microwave background observations. Similar arguments can generally be applied to some models of dark matter.</p>

<p>We consider a cosmic string moving through a gas of superfluid dark matter (SFDM) particles and analyze how it affects the dark matter distribution. We look at two different cases: first, a cosmic string passing through an already condensed region, and second, through a region that is not yet condensed. In the former, the string induces a weak shock in the superfluid, and the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) survives. In the latter, a wake of larger density is formed behind the string, and we study under which conditions a BEC can be formed in the virialized region of the wake. By requiring the thermalization of the DM particles and the overlap of their de Broglie wavelengths inside the wake, we obtain an upper bound on the mass of the dark matter particles on the order of 10 eV, which is compatible with typical SFDM models.</p>

<p>2023-07-06, <strong>Modelling a Hot Horizon in Global 21 cm Experimental Foregrounds</strong>, Joe H. N. Pattison et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02908v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.02908v1</a></p>

<p>The 21 cm signal from cosmic hydrogen is one of the most propitious probes of the early Universe. The detection of this signal would reveal key information about the first stars, the nature of dark matter, and early structure formation. We explore the impact of an emissive and reflective, or `hotâ, horizon on the recovery of this signal for global 21 cm experiments. It is demonstrated that using physically motivated foreground models to recover the sky-averaged 21 cm signal one must accurately describe the horizon around the radiometer. We show that not accounting for the horizon will lead to a signal recovery with residuals an order of magnitude larger than the injected signal, with a log Bayesian evidence of almost 1600 lower than when one does account for the horizon. It is shown that signal recovery is sensitive to incorrect values of soil temperature and reflection coefficient in describing the horizon, with even a 10% error in reflectance causing twofold increases in the RMSE of a given fit. We also show these parameters may be fitted using Bayesian inference to mitigate for these issues without overfitting and mischaracterising a non-detection. We further demonstrate that signal recovery is sensitive to errors in measurements of the horizon projection onto the sky, but fitting for soil temperature and reflection coefficients with priors that extend beyond physical expectation can resolve these problems. We show that using an expanded prior range can reliably recover the signal even when the height of the horizon is mismeasured by up to 20%, decreasing the RMSE from the model that does not perform this fitting by a factor of 9.</p>

<p>2023-07-05, <strong>Influence of Primordial Black Holes on Cosmic Reionization through Semi-Analytical Modelling</strong>, Krish Jhurani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02677v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.02677v1</a></p>

<p>This research addresses the influence of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) on cosmic reionization, using a robust semi-analytical model. This model encapsulates cosmological theory, PBH physics, and radiative transfer, with a lognormal PBH mass function as the fulcrum, with the mean PBH mass set at 30 solar masses and the fraction of dark matter in PBHs ($f_{PBH}$) varied from 1.26 to 10. We also adopt a standard thin-disk accretion model and a one-dimensional radiative transfer code for a comprehensive depiction of cosmic reionization under the influence of PBHs. Our major findings reveal an inverse relationship between PBH mass and ionizing efficiency. For instance, when the mean PBH mass is 10 solar masses, and $f_{PBH}$ is 0.1, the resulting ionizing efficiency is approximately 0.25, which drops to 0.15 with a mean PBH mass of 50 solar masses. However, with $f_{PBH}$ nearing unity, even large PBHs (mean mass of 100 solar masses) can achieve an ionizing efficiency close to 0.2. The ionization history indicates that for a mean PBH mass of 10 solar masses and $f_{PBH}$ at 0.01, rapid ionization commences at z=12.5+0.5/z=12.5-0.5 and concludes at z=9+0.5/z=9-0.5. Conversely, with a larger PBH mass of 100 solar masses and $f_{PBH}$ at 0.01, reionization initiates later, at z=10.8+0.4/z=10.8-0.4. Our two-point correlation function analysis unveils the formation of ionized bubbles with an initial size of approximately 10 Mpc at z=7.5+0.5/z=7.5-0.5 for an $f_{PBH}$ of 0.01, expanding to 20 Mpc by the end of reionization. With $f_{PBH}$ of 0.1, larger bubbles form, starting at approximately 15 Mpc and reaching 30 Mpc by reionizationâs end. In conclusion, PBHs significantly influence cosmic reionization, with PBH mass and their contribution to dark matter modulating this impact.</p>

<p>There is currently no evidence for a baryon asymmetry in our Universe. Instead, cosmological observations have only demonstrated the existence of a quark-antiquark asymmetry, which does not necessarily imply a baryon asymmetric Universe, since the baryon number of the dark sector particles is unknown. In this paper we discuss a framework where the total baryon number of the Universe is equal to zero, and where the observed quark-antiquark asymmetry arises from neutron portal interactions with a dark sector fermion $N$ that carries baryon number. In order to render a baryon symmetric universe throughout the whole cosmological history, we introduce a complex scalar $\chi$, with opposite baryon number and with the same initial abundance as $N$. Notably, due to the baryon number conservation, $\chi$ is absolutely stable and could have an abundance today equal to the observed dark matter abundance. Therefore, in this simple framework, the existence of a quark-antiquark asymmetry is intimately related to the existence (and the stability) of dark matter.</p>

<p>The dynamics of spin in external electromagnetic, gravitational, and axion fields is analysed in the framework of the gravitoelectromagnetism approach in Einsteinâs general relativity theory. We consistently extend the recent studies from the flat Minkowski geometry to the curved spacetime manifolds, contributing to the discussion of the possible new role of a precessing spin as an ``axion antennaââ that can be used to detect the hypothetical axion-like dark matter. The formalism developed helps to clarify the subtle influence of the gravitational/inertial and axion fields in the ultra-sensitive high-energy spin experiments with charged particles and neutrons at accelerators and storage rings devoted to testing fundamental physical symmetries, including attempts to establish the nature of dark matter in the Universe.</p>

<p>We present, for the first time, dark matter halo (DMH) mass measurement of quasars at $z\sim6$ based on a clustering analysis of 107 quasars. Spectroscopically identified quasars are homogeneously extracted from the HSC-SSP wide layer over $891\,\mathrm{deg^2}$. We evaluate the clustering strength by three different auto-correlation functions: projected correlation function, angular correlation function, and redshift-space correlation function. The DMH mass of quasars at $z\sim6$ is evaluated as $5.0_{-4.0}^{+7.4}\times10^{12}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$ with the bias parameter $b=20.8\pm8.7$ by the projected correlation function. The other two estimators agree with these values, though each uncertainty is large. The DMH mass of quasars is found to be nearly constant $\sim10^{12.5}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$ throughout cosmic time, suggesting that there is a characteristic DMH mass where quasars are always activated. As a result, quasars appear in the most massive halos at $z \sim 6$, but in less extreme halos thereafter. The DMH mass does not appear to exceed the upper limit of $10^{13}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$, which suggests that most quasars reside in DMHs with $M_\mathrm{halo}&lt;10^{13}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$ across most of the cosmic time. Our results supporting a significant increasing bias with redshift are consistent with the bias evolution model with inefficient AGN feedback at $z\sim6$. The duty cycle ($f_\mathrm{duty}$) is estimated as $0.019\pm0.008$ by assuming that DMHs in some mass interval can host a quasar. The average stellar mass is evaluated from stellar-to-halo mass ratio as $M_*=6.5_{-5.2}^{+9.6}\times10^{10}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$, which is found to be consistent with [C II] observational results.</p>

<p>Thermal dark matter models with particle $\chi$ masses below the electroweak scale can provide an explanation for the observed relic dark matter density. This would imply the existence of a new feeble interaction between the dark and ordinary matter. We report on a new search for the sub-GeV $\chi$ production through the interaction mediated by a new vector boson, called the dark photon $Aâ$, in collisions of 100 GeV electrons with the active target of the NA64 experiment at the CERN SPS. With $9.37\times10^{11}$ electrons on target collected during 2016-2022 runs NA64 probes for the first time the well-motivated region of parameter space of benchmark thermal scalar and fermionic dark matter models. No evidence for dark matter production has been found. This allows us to set the most sensitive limits on the $Aâ$ couplings to photons for masses $m_{Aâ} \lesssim 0.35$ GeV, and to exclude scalar and Majorana dark matter with the $\chi-Aâ$ coupling $\alpha_D \leq 0.1$ for masses $0.001 \lesssim m_\chi \lesssim 0.1$ GeV and $3m_\chi \leq m_{Aâ}$.</p>

<p>In the framework of scalar-tensor gravity, we consider non-flat interacting quintessence cosmology where a scalar field is interacting with dark matter. Such a scalar field can be a standard or a phantom one. We use the Noether Symmetry Approach to obtain general exact solutions for cosmological equations and to select scalar-field self-interaction potentials. It turns out that the found solutions can reproduce the accelerated expansion of the Universe, and are compatible with observational dataset, as the SNeIa Pantheon data, gamma ray bursts Hubble diagram, and direct measurements of the Hubble parameter.</p>

<p>2023-07-05, <strong>Spin-1 Thermal Targets for Dark Matter Searches at Beam Dump and Fixed Target Experiments</strong>, Riccardo Catena et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02207v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.02207v1</a></p>

<p>The current framework for dark matter searches at beam dump and fixed target experiments relies on four benchmark models, the complex scalar, inelastic scalar, pseudo-Dirac and finally, Majorana DM models. While this approach has so far been successful in the interpretation of the available data, it a priori excludes the possibility that DM is made of spin-1 particles â a restriction which is neither theoretically nor experimentally justified. In this work we extend the current landscape of sub-GeV DM models to a set of models for spin-1 DM, including a family of simplified models (involving one DM candidate and one mediator â the dark photon) and an ultraviolet complete model based on a non-abelian gauge group where DM is a spin-1 Strongly Interacting Massive Particle. For each of these models, we calculate the DM relic density, the expected number of signal events at beam dump experiments, the rate of energy injection in the early universe thermal bath and in the Intergalactic Medium, as well as the helicity amplitudes for forward processes subject to the unitary bound. We then compare these predictions with experimental results from Planck, CMB surveys, IGM temperature observations, LSND, MiniBooNE, NA64, and BaBar and with available projections from LDMX and Belle II. Through this comparison, we identify the regions in the parameter space of the models considered in this work where DM is simultaneously thermally produced, compatible with present observations, and within reach at Belle II and LDMX. We find that the simplified models are strongly constrained by current beam dump experiments and the unitarity bound, and will thus be conclusively probed in the first stage of LDMX data taking. We also find that the SIMP model explored in this work predicts the observed DM abundance, is compatible with current observations and within reach at LDMX in a wide region of the parameter space.</p>

<p>In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the electroweak sphaleron formalism and its application to electroweak phase transition (EWPT) patterns in extensions of the Standard Model scalar sector with electroweak multiplets. We offer an equivalence proof for different choices for the form of sphaleron configurations; construct the previously unestablished high-dimensional $\text{SU}(2)$ sphaleron transformation matrix; and revisit the required boundary conditions needed for solving the sphaleron field equations. We then investigate the leading order sphaleron dynamics in the context of a multi-step EWPT. We showcase two distinct analytical approaches for extending the $\text{SU}(2)$ scalar multiplet to the standard model (SM) under differing EWPT scenarios, and perform an explicit calculation of the sphaleron energy using a septuplet example. In the context of a single-step EWPT leading to a mixed phase, we find that the additional multipletâs contribution to the sphaleron energy is negligible, primarily due to the prevailing constraint imposed by the $\rho$ parameter. Conversely, in a two-step EWPT scenario, the sphaleron energy can achieve significantly high values during the initial phase, thereby markedly preserving baryon asymmetry if the universe undergoes a first-order EWPT. In both cases, we delineate the relationship between the sphaleron energy and the parameters relevant to dark matter phenomenology.</p>

<p>We present the discovery of Type II supernova (SN) 2023ixf in M101, among the closest core-collapse SNe in the last several decades, and follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations in the first month of its evolution. The light curve is characterized by a rapid rise ($\approx5$ days) to a luminous peak ($M_V\approx-18$ mag) and plateau ($M_V\approx-17.6$ mag) extending to $30$ days with a smooth decline rate of $\approx0.03$ mag day$^{-1}$. During the rising phase, $U-V$ color shows blueward evolution, followed by redward evolution in the plateau phase. Prominent flash features of hydrogen, helium, carbon, and nitrogen dominate the spectra up to $\approx5$ days after first light, with a transition to a higher ionization state in the first $\approx2$ days. Both the $U-V$ color and flash ionization states suggest a rise in the temperature, indicative of a delayed shock-breakout inside dense circumstellar material (CSM). From the timescales of CSM interaction, we estimate its compact radial extent of $\sim(3-7)\times10^{14}$ cm. We then construct numerical light-curve models based on both continuous and eruptive mass-loss scenarios shortly before explosion. For the continuous mass-loss scenario, we infer a range of mass-loss history with $0.1-1.0$ $M_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1}$ in the final $2-1$ years before explosion, with a potentially decreasing mass loss of $0.01-0.1$ $M_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1}$ in $\sim0.7-0.4$ years towards the explosion. For the eruptive mass-loss scenario, we favor eruptions releasing $0.3-1$ $M_\odot$ of the envelope at about a year before explosion, which result in CSM with mass and extent similar to the continuous scenario. We discuss the implications of the available multi-wavelength constraints obtained thus far on the progenitor candidate and SN 2023ixf to our variable CSM models.</p>

<p>2023-07-06, <strong>Cosmological effects of the Galileon term in Scalar-Tensor Theories</strong>, A. G. Ferrari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02987v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.02987v1</a></p>

<p>We study the cosmological effects of a Galileon term in scalar-tensor theories of gravity. The subset of scalar-tensor theories considered are characterized by a non-minimal coupling $F(\sigma) R$, a kinetic term with arbitrary sign $Z (\partial \sigma)^2$ with $Z = \pm 1$, a potential $V(\sigma)$, and a Galileon term $G_3(\sigma, (\partial \sigma)^2) \square \sigma$. In addition to the modified dynamics, the Galileon term provides a screening mechanism to potentially reconcile the models with General Relativity predictions inside a Vainshtein radius. Thanks to the Galileon term, the stability conditions, namely ghost and Laplacian instabilities, in the branch with a negative kinetic term ($Z = -1$) are fulfilled for a large volume of the parameter space. Solving numerically the background evolution and linear perturbations, we derive the constraints on the cosmological parameters in presence of a Galileon term for different combination of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from BOSS, and supernovae from the Pantheon compilation. We find that the Galileon term alters the dynamics of all the studied cases. For a standard kinetic term ($Z = 1$), we find that Planck data and a compilation of BAO data constrain the Galileon term to small values that allow screening very inefficiently. For a negative kinetic term ($Z = -1$), a Galileon term and a non-zero potential lead to an efficient screening in a physically viable regime of the theory, with a value for the Hubble constant today which alleviates the tension between its CMB and local determinations. For a vanishing potential, the case with $Z=-1$ and the Galileon term driving the late acceleration of the Universe is ruled out by Planck data.</p>

<p>In this paper we revisit metal-enriched pair instability supernovae (PISNe) models which undergo chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE). By calculating multiple models, we intend to clarify mass ranges for the PISNe, $^{56}$Ni masses from the PISNe, and mass loss histories of CHE-PISNe models for metallicities consistent with the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We show that for an initial velocity of $v_{\rm i}/ v_{\rm k}$ = 0.1, these models undergo CHE and He-rich (Type Ib) PISNe occur in a lower mass range ($M_{\rm i} \sim 110-170 M_\odot$) than for more slowly rotating models. Interestingly, bright PISNe which have $^{56}$Ni masses larger than 10 $M_\odot$ occur in a relatively small mass range, $M_{\rm i} \sim 140-170 M_\odot$. Another notable characteristic of CHE-PISNe is the large late time mass loss rates; consequently, CSM interaction may be observable in their light curves. We also show some examples of O-rich (Type Ic) CHE-PISNe produced by $v_{\rm i}/ v_{\rm k}$ = 0.2 models. We expect these models to exhibit interaction with O-rich CSM, behavior which is consistent with the observed properties of the recently discovered PISN candidate, SN2018ibb. Finally, we present a collapsing $v_{\rm i}/ v_{\rm k}$ = 0.2 model which has sufficient angular momentum to be regarded as a candidate for a Super-Kilonova.</p>

We discuss previously stated requirements for the science, and a baseline survey strategy. We discuss the various areas that must still be optimized and point to the other white papers that consider these topics in detail. Overall, the baseline case should enable an exquisite measurement of dark energy using SNe Ia from z=0.1 to z&gt;2, and further optimization should only strengthen this once-in-a-generation experiment.</p>

<p>Mediation analysis in causal inference typically concentrates on one binary exposure, using deterministic interventions to split the average treatment effect into direct and indirect effects through a single mediator. Yet, real-world exposure scenarios often involve multiple continuous exposures impacting health outcomes through varied mediation pathways, which remain unknown a priori. Addressing this complexity, we introduce NOVAPathways, a methodological framework that identifies exposure-mediation pathways and yields unbiased estimates of direct and indirect effects when intervening on these pathways. By pairing data-adaptive target parameters with stochastic interventions, we offer a semi-parametric approach for estimating causal effects in the context of high-dimensional, continuous, binary, and categorical exposures and mediators. In our proposed cross-validation procedure, we apply sequential semi-parametric regressions to a parameter-generating fold of the data, discovering exposure-mediation pathways. We then use stochastic interventions on these pathways in an estimation fold of the data to construct efficient estimators of natural direct and indirect effects using flexible machine learning techniques. Our estimator proves to be asymptotically linear under conditions necessitating n to the negative quarter consistency of nuisance function estimation. Simulation studies demonstrate the square root n consistency of our estimator when the exposure is quantized, whereas for truly continuous data, approximations in numerical integration prevent square root n consistency. Our NOVAPathways framework, part of the open-source SuperNOVA package in R, makes our proposed methodology for high-dimensional mediation analysis available to researchers, paving the way for the application of modified exposure policies which can delivery more informative statistical results for public policy.</p>

<p>2023-07-05, <strong>AT2022aedm and a new class of luminous, fast-cooling transients in elliptical galaxies</strong>, M. Nicholl et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02556v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.02556v1</a></p>

<p>We present the discovery and extensive follow-up of a remarkable fast-evolving optical transient, AT2022aedm, detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial impact Last Alert Survey (ATLAS). AT2022aedm exhibited a rise time of $9\pm1$ days in the ATLAS $o$-band, reaching a luminous peak with $M_g\approx-22$ mag. It faded by 2 magnitudes in $g$-band during the next 15 days. These timescales are consistent with other rapidly evolving transients, though the luminosity is extreme. Most surprisingly, the host galaxy is a massive elliptical with negligible current star formation. X-ray and radio observations rule out a relativistic AT2018cow-like explosion. A spectrum in the first few days after explosion showed short-lived He II emission resembling young core-collapse supernovae, but obvious broad supernova features never developed; later spectra showed only a fast-cooling continuum and narrow, blue-shifted absorption lines, possibly arising in a wind with $v\approx2700$ km s$^{-1}$. We identify two further transients in the literature (Dougie in particular, as well as AT2020bot) that share similarities in their luminosities, timescales, colour evolution and largely featureless spectra, and propose that these may constitute a new class of transients: luminous fast-coolers (LFCs). All three events occurred in passive galaxies at offsets of $\sim4-10$ kpc from the nucleus, posing a challenge for progenitor models involving massive stars or massive black holes. The light curves and spectra appear to be consistent with shock breakout emission, though usually this mechanism is associated with core-collapse supernovae. The encounter of a star with a stellar mass black hole may provide a promising alternative explanation.</p>

<p>We present a detailed study on SN2019szu, a Type I superluminous supernova at $z=0.213$, that displayed unique photometric and spectroscopic properties. Pan-STARRS and ZTF forced photometry shows a pre-explosion plateau lasting $\sim$ 40 days. Unlike other SLSNe that show decreasing photospheric temperatures with time, the optical colours show an apparent temperature increase from $\sim$15000\,K to $\sim$20000\,K over the first 70 days, likely caused by an additional pseudo-continuum in the spectrum. Remarkably, the spectrum displays a forbidden emission line even during the rising phase of the light curve, inconsistent with an apparently compact photosphere. We show that this early feature is [O II] $\lambda\lambda$7320,7330. We also see evidence for [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959, 5007, and [O III] $\lambda$4363 further strengthening this line identification. Comparing with models for nebular emission, we find that the oxygen line fluxes and ratios can be reproduced with $\sim$0.25\,M$_{\odot}$ of oxygen rich material with a density of $\sim10^{-15}\,\rm{g\,cm}^{-3}$. The low density suggests a circumstellar origin, but the early onset of the emission lines requires that this material was ejected within the final months before the terminal explosion, consistent with the timing of the precursor plateau. Interaction with denser material closer to the explosion likely produced the pseudo-continuum bluewards of $\sim$5500\,$\Angstrom$. We suggest that this event is one of the best candidates to date for a pulsational pair-instability ejection, with early pulses providing the low density material needed for the forbidden emission line, and collisions between the final shells of ejected material producing the pre-explosion plateau.</p>

<p>This study aims to elucidate the tension in the Hubble constant ($H_0$), a key metric in cosmology representing the universeâs expansion rate. Conflicting results from independent measurements such as the Planck satellite mission and the SH0ES collaboration have sparked interest in exploring alternative cosmological models. We extend the analysis by SH0ES to an arbitrary cosmographic model, obtaining a competitive local $H_0$ determination which only assumes the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM model ($73.14 \pm 1.10$ km/s/Mpc), and another which only assumes the FLRW metric ($74.56 \pm 1.61$ km/s/Mpc). The study also stresses the importance of the supernova magnitude calibration ($M_B$) in cosmological inference and highlights the tension in $M_B$ when supernovae are calibrated either by CMB and BAO observations or the first two rungs of the cosmic distance ladder. This discrepancy, independent of the physics involved, suggests that models solely changing the Hubble flow and maintaining a sound horizon distance consistent with CMB, fail to explain the discrepancy between early- and late-time measurements of $H_0$.</p>

<p>We present an International LOFAR Telescope sub-arcsecond resolution image of the nearby galaxy M 51 with a beam size of 0.436â x 0.366â and rms of 46 $\mu$Jy. We compare this image with an European VLBI Network study of M 51, and discuss the supernovae in this galaxy, which have not yet been probed at these low radio frequencies. We find a flux density of 0.97 mJy for SN 2011dh in the ILT image, which is about five times smaller than the flux density reported by the LOFAR Twometre Sky Survey at 6â resolution using the same dataset without the international stations. This difference makes evident the need for LOFAR international baselines to reliably obtain flux density measurements of compact objects in nearby galaxies. Our LOFAR flux density measurement of SN 2011dh directly translates into fitting the radio light curves for the supernova and constraining massloss rates of progenitor star. We do not detect two other supernovae in the same galaxy, SN 1994I and SN 2005cs, and our observations place limits on the evolution of both supernovae at radio wavelengths. We also discuss the radio emission from the centre of M 51, in which we detect the Active Galactic Nucleus and other parts of the nuclear emission in the galaxy, and a possible detection of Component N. We discuss a few other sources, including the detection of a High mass X-ray Binary not detected by LoTSS, but with a flux density in the ILT image that matches well with higher frequency catalogues.</p>

<p>2023-07-05, <strong>Possible Circumstellar Interaction Origin of the Early Excess Emission in Thermonuclear Supernovae</strong>, Maokai Hu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02186v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.02186v1</a></p>

<p>Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) arise from the thermonuclear explosion in binary systems involving carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs). The pathway of WDs acquiring mass may produce circumstellar material (CSM). Observing SNe Ia within a few hours to a few days after the explosion can provide insight into the nature of CSM relating to the progenitor systems. In this paper, we propose a CSM model to investigate the effect of ejecta-CSM interaction on the early-time multi-band light curves of SNe Ia. By varying the mass-loss history of the progenitor system, we apply the ejecta-CSM interaction model to fit the optical and ultraviolet (UV) photometric data of eight SNe Ia with early excess. The photometric data of SNe Ia in our sample can be well-matched by our CSM model except for the UV-band light curve of iPTF14atg, indicating its early excess may not be due to the ejecta-CSM interaction. Meanwhile, the CSM interaction can generate synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons in the shocked gas, making radio observations a distinctive probe of CSM. The radio luminosity based on our models suggests that positive detection of the radio signal is only possible within a few days after the explosion at higher radio frequencies (e.g., ~250 GHz); at lower frequencies (e.g., ~1.5 GHz) the detection is difficult. These models lead us to conclude that a multi-messenger approach that involves UV, optical, and radio observations of SNe Ia a few days past explosion is needed to address many of the outstanding questions concerning the progenitor systems of SNe Ia.</p>
