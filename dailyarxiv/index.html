<p>2024-07-17, <strong>New Laboratory Constraints on Neutrinophilic Mediators</strong>, P. S. Bhupal Dev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12738v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.12738v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinophilic mediators are well-motivated messenger particles that can probe some of the least known sectors of fundamental physics involving nonstandard interactions of neutrinos with themselves and potentially with dark matter. In particular, light mediators coupling to the active neutrinos will induce new decay modes of the Standard Model mesons (e.g., $\pi^\pm, K^\pm \to \ell^\pm + \nu + \phi$), charged leptons (e.g., $\tau^\pm \to \pi^\pm + \nu + \phi$), and gauge bosons (e.g., $Z \to \nu + \bar{\nu} + \phi$). A common lore is that these decays suffer from infrared divergences in the limit of the vanishing mediator mass, i.e., $m_\phi \to 0$. Here, we show for the first time that including the 1-loop contributions of these mediators to the standard 2-body decays (e.g., $\pi^\pm,\,K^\pm \to \ell^\pm + \nu$, etc.), the infrared divergence from the 3-body decay cancels out exactly by virtue of the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem. Including these cancellation effects, we then update the existing laboratory constraints on neutrinophilic scalar mediators, thereby extending the limits far beyond the decaying parent particle mass and excluding a wider range of parameter space. These new “physical” limits derived here have significant implications for the future detection prospects of nonstandard neutrino (self-)interactions.</p>

<p>2024-07-17, <strong>Neutrino Halo profiles: HR-DEMNUni simulation analysis</strong>, Beatriz Hernández-Molinero et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12694v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.12694v1</a></p>

<p>Using the high-resolution HR-DEMNUni simulations, we computed neutrino profiles within virialized dark matter haloes. These new high-resolution simulations allowed us to revisit fitting formulas proposed in the literature and provided updated fitting parameters that extend to less massive haloes and lower neutrino masses than previously in the literature, in accordance with new cosmological limits. The trend we observe for low neutrino masses is that, for dark matter halo masses below $\sim 4\times10^{14}$$h^{-1}M_\odot$, the presence of the core becomes weaker and the profile over the whole radius is closer to a simple power law. We also characterized the neutrino density profile dependence on the solid angle within clustered structures: a forward-backward asymmetry larger than 10% was found when comparing the density profiles from neutrinos along the direction of motion of cold dark matter particles within the same halo. In addition, we looked for neutrino wakes around halo centres produced by the peculiar motion of the halo itself. Our results suggest that the wakes effect is observable in haloes with masses greater than $3\times10^{14}$ $h^{-1}M_\odot$ where a mean displacement of $0.06$\hmpc was found.</p>

<p>2024-07-17, <strong>Neutrino beaming in ultraluminous X-ray pulsars as a result of gravitational lensing by neutron stars</strong>, Alexander A. Mushtukov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12573v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.12573v1</a></p>

<p>X-ray pulsars experiencing extreme mass accretion rates can produce neutrino emission in the MeV energy band. Neutrinos in these systems are emitted in close proximity to the stellar surface and subsequently undergo gravitational bending in the space curved by a neutron star. This process results in the formation of a distinct beam pattern of neutrino emission and gives rise to the phenomenon of neutrino pulsars. The energy flux of neutrinos, when averaged over the neutron star’s pulsation period, can differ from the isotropic neutrino energy flux, which impacts the detectability of bright pulsars in neutrinos. We investigate the process of neutrino beam pattern formation, accounting for neutron star transparency to neutrinos and gravitational bending. Based on simulated neutrino beam patterns, we estimate the potential difference between the actual and apparent neutrino luminosity. We show that the apparent luminosity can greatly exceed the actual luminosity, albeit only in a small fraction of cases, depending on the specific equation of state and the mass of the star. For example, the amplification can exceed a factor of ten for $\approx0.2\%$ of typical neutron stars with mass of $1.4\,M_\odot$. Strong amplification is less probable for neutron stars of higher mass. In the case of strange stars, a fraction of high energy neutrinos can be absorbed and the beam pattern, as well as the amplification of apparent neutrino luminosity, depend on neutrino energy.</p>

<p>2024-07-17, <strong>Two-field inflation from one complex scalar with symmetry breaking</strong>, Yoshihiko Abe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12544v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.12544v1</a></p>

<p>We study two-field inflation derived from a single complex scalar with a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Inflation is characterized by two parameters, the vacuum expectation value and the mass parameter of the phase mode, which give rise to a variety of inflationary structures. We categorize the potential trajectories of the two inflaton fields and determine the parameter regions consistent with current observational data. Furthermore, we examine the reheating process through the inflaton decay to right-handed neutrinos and the subsequent lepton number generation within these parameter regions. Our finding suggests that the existence of multiple fields can significantly alter the possibilities for inflaton oscillations and reheating.</p>

<p>2024-07-17, <strong>Bulk viscosity of 2SC quark matter in neutron star mergers</strong>, Mark Alford et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12493v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.12493v1</a></p>

<p>We study the bulk viscosity of moderately hot and dense, neutrino-transparent color superconducting quark matter arising from weak-interaction-driven direct Urca processes. The quark matter is modeled using Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model improved to account for vector and t’Hooft interactions as well as antisymmetric pairing among the red/green up and down quarks. The unpaired excitations are the strange quarks and the blue up or down quarks. We compute the relaxation rates associated with $d$ and $s$-quark decay and electron capture processes on $u$ quark for blue color. The resulting bulk viscosity for density oscillations in the 1 to 10\,kHz range shows a resonant peak at $T\sim 5\,\MeV$, and the damping time may drop below 10 ms. This is short enough to affect the post-merger evolution and is very similar to the damping predicted in nuclear matter.</p>

<p>2024-07-17, <strong>Affine Connection and Quantum Theory</strong>, Kaushik Ghosh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12462v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.12462v1</a></p>

<p>In a few recent manuscripts, we used the affine connection to introduce two massless scalar fields in the Einstein-Palatini action. These fields lead to non-metricity. In this article, we will discuss the significance of these fields in inflation and dark energy. We will construct a Lagrangian formalism to include these scalar fields in a theory of gravity coupled with ordinary matter and radiation. We will find that these fields need not to be included in the actions of interacting gauge theories coupled with conserved fermionic vector currents as a part of the connection. The same remains valid for ordinary scalar fields. We can couple the connection-scalars with ordinary matter by adding suitable interaction terms. In this context, we will find that Stokes’ theorem leads us to include the right-handed neutrinos in the electroweak theory in curved spacetime even with the Levi-Civita connection. This is required to obtain consistent equations of motion and anomaly-free conserved vector current for the neutrinos. Axial vector currents for different Dirac fields may remain anomalous. The right-handed neutrinos can be useful to explain neutrino oscillation and dark matter. We will also discuss the possibility of introducing massless finite integer spin particles using second rank symmetric traceless tensors with reference to the corresponding little group in flat spacetime. We will show that we can use massless (A,A) type fields in Minkowski space to introduce massless finite integer spin particles.</p>

<p>2024-07-16, <strong>Calibration and simulation of ionization signal and electronics noise in the ICARUS liquid argon time projection chamber</strong>, ICARUS collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11925v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.11925v1</a></p>

<p>The ICARUS liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) neutrino detector has been taking physics data since 2022 as part of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) Program. This paper details the equalization of the response to charge in the ICARUS time projection chamber (TPC), as well as data-driven tuning of the simulation of ionization charge signals and electronics noise. The equalization procedure removes non-uniformities in the ICARUS TPC response to charge in space and time. This work leverages the copious number of cosmic ray muons available to ICARUS at the surface. The ionization signal shape simulation applies a novel procedure that tunes the simulation to match what is measured in data. The end result of the equalization procedure and simulation tuning allows for a comparison of charge measurements in ICARUS between Monte Carlo simulation and data, showing good performance with minimal residual bias between the two.</p>

<p>2024-07-16, <strong>The CONUS+ experiment</strong>, The CONUS+ Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11912v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.11912v1</a></p>

<p>The CONUS+ experiment aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) of reactor antineutrinos on germanium nuclei in the fully coherent regime, continuing on this way the CONUS physics program started at the Brokdorf nuclear power plant, Germany. The CONUS+ setup is installed in the nuclear power plant in Leibstadt, Switzerland, at a distance of 20.7 m from the 3.6 GW thermal power reactor core. The CEvNS signature will be measured with the same four point-contact high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors produced for the former experiment, however refurbished and with optimized low energy thresholds. To suppress the background in the CONUS+ detectors, the passive and active layers of the original CONUS shield were modified such to fit better to the significantly changed background conditions at the new experimental location. New data acquisition and monitoring systems were developed. A direct network connection between the experiment and the Max-Planck-Institut fur Kernphysik (MPIK) makes it possible to control and monitor data acquisition in real time. The impact of all these modifications is discussed with particular emphasis on the resulting CEvNS signal prediction for the first data collection phase of CONUS+. Prospects of the planned upgrade in a second phase integrating new larger HPGe detectors are also discussed.</p>

<p>2024-07-16, <strong>A Generic Analysis of Nucleon Decay Branching Fractions in Flipped SU(5) Grand Unification</strong>, Koichi Hamaguchi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11892v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.11892v1</a></p>

<p>In flipped SU(5) grand unified theories, the partial decay lifetimes of certain nucleon decay channels depend generically on an unknown unitary matrix, which arises when left-handed lepton fields are embedded into anti-fundamental representations of SU(5). This dependency is particularly relevant when the neutrino mass matrix has a generic structure, introducing uncertainty in the prediction of nucleon decay branching fractions within flipped SU(5). In this paper, we demonstrate that this uncertainty can be parametrized using two parameters, which can be determined by measuring the partial lifetimes of $p \to \pi^0 e^+$, $p \to \pi^0 \mu^+$, and $n \to \pi^0 \bar{\nu}$. In addition, we establish upper limits on the ratios of the decay widths of these channels, offering a potential method to test flipped SU(5) in future nucleon decay experiments.</p>

<p>2024-07-16, <strong>Tying knots in particle physics</strong>, Minoru Eto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11731v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.11731v1</a></p>

<p>Lord Kelvin’s pioneering hypothesis that the identity of atoms is knots of vortices of the aether had a profound impact on the fields of mathematics and physics despite being subsequently refuted by experiments. While knot-like excitations emerge in various systems of condensed matter physics, the fundamental constituents of matter have been revealed to be elementary particles such as electrons and quarks, seemingly leaving no room for the appearance of knots in particle physics. Here, we show that knots indeed appear as meta-stable solitons in a realistic extension of the standard model of particle physics that provides the QCD axion and right-handed neutrinos. This result suggests that during the early Universe, a “knot dominated era” may have existed, where knots were a dominant component of the Universe, and this scenario can be tested through gravitational wave observations. Furthermore, we propose that the end of this era involves the collapse of the knots via quantum tunneling, leading to the generation of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Our findings exhibit the significant role of knots in particle physics and represent a modern version of Kelvin’s hypothesis.</p>

<p>2024-07-16, <strong>High-energy neutrino emission from tidal disruption event outflow-cloud interactions</strong>, Hanji Wu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11410v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.11410v1</a></p>

<p>Tidal disruption events (TDEs), characterized by their luminous transients and high-velocity outflows, have emerged as plausible sources of high-energy neutrinos contributing to the diffuse neutrino. In this study, we calculate the contribution of TDEs to the diffuse neutrino by employing the outflow-cloud model within the TDE framework. Our analysis indicates that the contribution of TDEs becomes negligible when the redshift $Z$ exceeds 2. Employing a set of fiducial values, which includes outflow energy $E_{\rm kin}=10^{51}$ erg, a proton spectrum cutoff energy $E_{\rm p,max}=100$ PeV, a volume TDE rate $\dot{N}=8 \times 10^{-7}\ \rm Mpc^{-3}\ year^{-1}$, covering fraction of clouds $C_V=0.1$, energy conversion efficiency in the shock $\eta =0.1$, and a proton spectrum index $\Gamma=-1.7$, we find that TDEs can account for approximately 80\% of the contribution at energies around 0.3 PeV. Additionally, TDEs still contribute around 18\% to the IceCube data below 0.1 PeV and the total contribution is $\sim 24^{+2}_{-15}\%$. In addition, we also discuss the potential influence of various parameter values on the results in detail. With the IceCube data, we impose constraints on the combination of the physical parameters, i.e., $C_{f}=\dot{N}E_{\rm kin}C_{\rm v}\eta$. Future observations or theoretical considerations would fix some physical parameters, which will help to constrain some individual parameters of TDEs.</p>

<p>2024-07-17, <strong>Search for light dark matter with NEWS-G at the LSM using a methane target</strong>, M. M. Arora et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12769v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.12769v1</a></p>

<p>The NEWS-G direct detection experiment uses spherical proportional counters to search for light dark matter candidates. New results from a 10 day physics run with a $135\,\mathrm{cm}$ in diameter spherical proportional counter at the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane are reported. The target consists of $114\,\mathrm{g}$ of methane, providing sensitivity to dark matter spin-dependent coupling to protons. New constraints are presented in the mass range $0.17$ to $1.2\,\mathrm{GeV/c^2}$, with a 90% confidence level cross-section upper limit of $30.9\,\mathrm{pb}$ for a mass of $0.76\,\mathrm{GeV/c^2}$.</p>

<p>2024-07-17, <strong>How does dark matter stabilize disc galaxies?</strong>, K. Aditya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12740v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.12740v1</a></p>

<p>The study presents a theoretical framework for understanding the role of dark matter on the stability of the galactic disc. We model the galaxy as a two-component system consisting of stars and gas in equilibrium with an external dark matter halo. We derive the equations governing the growth of perturbations and obtain a stability criterion that connects the potential of the dark matter halo and the gas fraction with the stability levels of the galaxy. We find that a two-component disc is more susceptible to the growth of gravitational instabilities than individual components, particularly as gas fractions increase. However, the external field, due to the dark matter halo, acts as a stabilizing agent and increases the net stability levels even in the presence of a cold gas component. We apply the stability criterion to models of the Milky Way, low surface brightness galaxies, and baryon-dominated cold rotating disc galaxies observed in the early universe. Our results show that the potential due to the dark matter halo plays a significant role in stabilizing nearby galaxies, such as the Milky Way, and low surface brightness galaxies, which would otherwise be prone to local gravitational instabilities. However, we find that the baryon-dominated cold disc galaxies observed in the early universe remain susceptible to the growth of local gravitational instabilities despite the stabilizing effect of the dark matter halo.</p>

<p>2024-07-17, <strong>Milky Way: New Galactic mass model for orbit computations</strong>, Jozef Klačka et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12551v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.12551v1</a></p>

<p>Accurate observational data on the rotation curve of the Milky Way galaxy (MW) are very well understood using the gravitational potentials of the baryonic matter (Pouliasis et al., 2017) and the interpolating function presented by McGaugh et al. (2016). In this way we couple the spherically symmetric mass distribution of the dark matter (DM) to the mass distribution of the baryonic matter (BM). A commonly used model of the dark matter distribution can be understood as an approximation of our model. Creation of a new Galactic mass model for orbit computations based on the coupling of the DM with an improved BM model respecting the theoretical fit of the Galactic rotation curve. The theoretical approach is based on a slight improvement of the BM model by Pouliasis et al. (2017) and on replacement of their DM model by the model based on the interpolating function by McGaugh et al. (2016). The theoretical results are validated by the comparison with observational data. New Galactic mass model for orbit computations is created. DM distribution is given and the rotation curve for the MW is consistent with observational data. The Tully-Fisher relation holds and the values of several characteristics of the MW for the region of the Sun are given, e.g., rotation speed $v_0$ = ($228.8 \pm 0.2$) ~ \mbox{km} \mbox{s}$^{-1}$, Oort constants $A=(+14.73 \pm 0.03) ~\mbox{km} ~\mbox{s}^{-1} ~\mbox{kpc}^{-1} $, $B=(-13.01 \pm 0.03) ~\mbox{km} ~\mbox{s}^{-1} ~\mbox{kpc}^{-1}$ and the mass density of the baryonic matter $(0.087 \pm 0.001) ~\mbox{M}_{\odot} ~\mbox{pc}^{-3} $.

<p>With the release of Gaia DR3, we extend the comparison between dynamical models for the Milky Way rotation curve initiated in the previous work. Utilising astrometric and spectro-photometric data for 719143 young disc stars within $|z|&lt;1$ kpc and up to $R \simeq 19$ kpc, we investigate the accuracy of MOND and $\Lambda$CDM frameworks in addition to previously studied models, such as the classical one with a Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo and a general relativistic model. We find that all models, including MOND and $\Lambda$CDM, are statistically equivalent in representing the observed rotational velocities. However, $\Lambda$CDM, characterized by an Einasto density profile and cosmological constraints on its parameters, assigns more dark matter than the model featuring a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, with the virial mass estimated at $1.5\text{-}2.5 \times 10^{12} \, {\rm M}_{\odot}$ - a value significantly higher than recent literature estimates. Beyond $10\text{-}15$ kpc, non-Newtonian/non-baryonic contributions to the rotation curve are found to become dominant for all models consistently. Our results suggest the need for further exploration into the role of General Relativity, dark matter, and alternative theories of gravitational dynamics in shaping Milky Way’s rotation curve.</p>

<p>In this work, we study a static, spherically charged AdS black hole within a modified cosmological Chaplygin gas (MCG), adhering to the calorific equation of state, as a unified dark fluid model of dark energy and dark matter. We explore the influence of model parameters on several characteristics of the MCG-motivated charged AdS black hole (MCGMBH), including the geodesic structure and some astrophysical phenomena such as null trajectories, shadow silhouettes, light deflection angles, and the determination of greybody bounds. We then discuss how the model parameters affect the Hawking temperature, remnant radius, and evaporation process of the MCGMBH. Quasinormal modes are also investigated using the eikonal approximation method. Constraints on the MCGMBH parameters are derived from EHT observations of M87* and Sgr A*, suggesting that MCGMBH could be strong candidates for astrophysical BH.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the possibility of Dark Matter (DM) fermions production alongside a gauge boson (A$^{\prime}$) using a model based on Einstein-Cartan gravity in an electron-positron linear collider, such as the ILC, that operates at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 500$ GeV with a detector’s integrated luminosity of 1000 fb$^{-1}$. We used the WHIZARD package as the event generator to simulate the $ e^{+} e^{-}$ interactions that lead to the production of di-muon pairs and missing transverse energy. We specifically are performing this study on a low mass dark gauge boson, M$_{A^\prime}$= 10 GeV, that can subsequently decay into a muon pair (A$^\prime\rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-})$ while aiming to set upper limits on the free parameters’ masses of the model, such as the torsion field (ST), if evidence for physics beyond the standard model is not found.</p>

<p>Self-Interacting Dark Matter models can successfully explain dark matter (DM) production through interactions confined within the dark sector. However, they often lack measurable experimental signals due to their secluded nature. Including a feeble interaction with the visible sector through a Higgs portal leads not only to potential detection avenues and richer thermal production dynamics, but also to a possible explanation of the initial dark sector population through the freeze-in mechanism. In this work we study, by solving the full system of coupled Boltzmann equations for the number densities and temperatures of all the involved states, three scenarios of this type where the DM is: a real scalar with broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$, a complex scalar with unbroken $\mathbb{Z}_3$, and a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ scalar with an additional scalar mediator. All of these models have viable dark matter candidates in a cannibal phase while having different detection profiles. We show that cosmological bounds can be either exacerbated or evaded by changing the dark sector interactions, leading to potential signatures in long-lived particle and indirect detection experiments.</p>

<p>2024-07-16, <strong>Impact of star formation models on the growth of galaxies at high redshifts</strong>, Cheonsu Kang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12090v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.12090v1</a></p>

<p>To understand the impact of star formation models on galaxy evolution, we perform cosmological zoom-in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of a dwarf dark matter halo with virial mass 1e9 Msun at z=6. Two different star formation models are compared, a model based on a local gravo-thermo-turbulent condition and a model based on a sink particle algorithm. Using idealized tests of collapsing isothermal spheres and giant molecular clouds with different turbulent structures, we determine the optimal accretion radius to be twice the cell size and the resolution required to achieve reasonable convergence in star formation efficiency to 0.3 pc for the sink algorithm. As a first study in this series, we use cosmological zoom-in simulations with different spatial resolutions and find that star formation is more bursty in the runs with the sink algorithm, generating stronger outflows than in the runs with the gravo-thermo-turbulent model. The main reason for the increased burstiness is that the gas accretion rates on the sinks are high enough to form stars on very short timescales, leading to more clustered star formation. As a result, the star-forming clumps are disrupted more quickly in the sink run due to more coherent radiation and supernova feedback. The difference in burstiness between the two star formation models becomes even more pronounced when the supernova explosion energy is artificially increased. Our results suggest that improving the modelling of star formation on small, sub-molecular cloud scales can significantly impact the global properties of simulated galaxies.</p>

<p>2024-07-16, <strong>A $\sim 43$ GeV $γ$-ray line signature in the directions of a group of nearby massive galaxy clusters</strong>, Yi-Zhong Fan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11737v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.11737v1</a></p>

<p>As the largest gravitationally bound objects in the Universe, galaxy clusters have provided the first piece of evidence for the presence of dark matter and may be suitable targets for indirect dark matter searches. Among various signals, the GeV-TeV $\gamma$-ray line has been taken as the smoking-gun signal of the dark matter annihilation/decay since no known astrophysical/physical process(es) could generate such a peculiar spectrum. With 15.5 years of Fermi-LAT P8R3 publicly available data, we search for the $\gamma$-ray line emission in the directions of a group of 13 nearby massive galaxy clusters with an unbinned likelihood analysis. A $\gamma$-ray line signal at $\sim 43.2$ GeV has a net TS value of $\approx 30$ if we only take into account the data in the directions of Virgo, Fornax and Ophiuchus clusters, three massive clusters with the highest J-factors expected to generate the dark matter annihilation signal. The signal still presents when the data of other 10 nearby massive clusters have also been included, though the TS value decreases to $\approx 21$ likely because of their lower signal-to-noise ratios. The absence of this signal in the inner Galaxy disfavors both the instrumental effect and the canonical dark matter annihilation interpretation, and a more sophisticated dark matter model or very peculiar astrophysical scenario might be needed. This $\gamma$-ray line signal, if intrinsic, could be unambiguously verified by the Very Large Area $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope in its first two years of performance.</p>

<p>2024-07-16, <strong>Particle Conversions Beyond the WKB Approximation and Solar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Dark Photon Dark Matter</strong>, Tengyu Ai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11653v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.11653v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the conversion of kinetic mixing dark photon dark matter into gravitational waves within the magnetic field of the Sun. Our study reveals that the WKB approximation is invalid in this scenario. We derive an analytic solution for the conversion probability with unitary evolution feature. This solution aligns in form with previous studies on photon-gravitational wave conversion. Interestingly, it is applicable in situations where the WKB approximation fails. We extend the unitary evolution solution to other conversion processes, such as axion-photon and dark photon-photon conversions. When the WKB approximation conditions are met, this solution reduces to the WKB result. We compute the characteristic strain of gravitational waves resulting from dark photon conversion in the solar magnetic field, spanning frequencies from $10^{-5}$ Hz to $10^3$ Hz. Our findings indicate that the characteristic strain derived from the unitary evolution solution differs significantly from that of the WKB solution. The resulting strain signal is far below the sensitivity of current gravitational wave interferometers. Nevertheless, we have proposed an exotic gravitational wave source, especially at high frequencies, from the dark photon dark matter local conversion inside the Sun.</p>

<p>2024-07-16, <strong>Tidal Disruption of Stars by Supermassive Black Holes and Naked Singularities with Scalar Hair</strong>, Eduardo Andre et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11535v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.11535v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper we study tidal forces near strongly gravitating objects at the centers of galaxies. In our approach, dark matter surrounding the centers of galaxies is modeled by a nonlinear scalar field. We focus on static, asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric black holes and naked singularities supported by a real self-gravitating scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. We consider the influence of dark matter on the tidal forces caused by the central objects and some features of the motion of matter near these configurations. It turns out, first, that the event horizon radius of a scalar field black hole can be arbitrarily small as well as the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit, and tidal forces near this orbit can be very large. Second, we show that if strongly gravitating objects in the centers of galaxies are naked singularities, then bright flares (tidal disruption events) in the nuclei of galaxies can be explained in different way. In the vicinity of a scalar field naked singularity, baryonic matter is concentrated in the gravitational potential well forming a “gray shell” consisting of cold compressed matter. In this case, the flares are caused by the collisions of stars with this shell.</p>

<p>Light emission in the first hours and days following core-collapse supernovae is dominated by the escape of photons from the expanding shock-heated envelope. In preceding papers, we provided a simple analytic description of the time-dependent luminosity, $L$, and color temperature, $T_{\rm col}$, as well as of the small ($\simeq10\%$) deviations of the spectrum from blackbody at low frequencies, $h\nu&lt; 3T_{\rm col}$, and of `line dampening’ at $h\nu&gt; 3T_{\rm col}$, for explosions of red supergiants (RSGs) with convective polytropic envelopes (without significant circum-stellar medium). Here, we extend our work to provide similar analytic formulae for explosions of blue supergiants with radiative polytropic envelopes. The analytic formulae are calibrated against a large set of spherically symmetric multi-group (frequency-dependent) calculations for a wide range of progenitor parameters (mass, radius, core/envelope mass ratios) and explosion energies. In these calculations we use the opacity tables we constructed (and made publicly available), that include the contributions of bound-bound and bound-free transitions. They reproduce the numeric $L$ and $T_{\rm col}$ to within 10\% and 5\% accuracy, and the spectral energy distribution to within $\sim20-40\%$. The accuracy is similar to that achieved for RSG explosions.</p>

<p>Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a population of supernovae (SNe) whose peak luminosities are much larger than those of canonical SNe. Although SLSNe were simply defined by their peak luminosity at first, it is currently recognized that they show rich spectroscopic diversities including hydrogen-poor (Type I) and hydrogen-rich (Type II) subtypes. The exact mechanisms making SLSNe luminous are still not fully understood, but there are mainly four major suggested luminosity sources (radioactive decay of 56Ni, circumstellar interaction, magnetar spin-down, and fallback accretion). We provide an overview of observational properties of SLSNe and major theoretical models for them. Future transient surveys are expected to discover SLSNe at high redshifts which will provide a critical information in revealing their nature.</p>

<p>The current perspective about the explosions of blue supergiants is that they resemble SN 1987A. These so-called peculiar Type II supernovae, however, are one of the rarest types of supernovae and may not hence be the fate of all blue supergiants. In this work, we explore other explosion scenarios for blue supergiants. We create synthetic light curves from the explosions of blue supergiant models born from binary mergers, over a range of explosion energies and 56Ni masses. We find that blue supergiant explosions may also lead to intermediate-luminosity red transients. We thus identify two categories of supernovae possible from blue supergiant explosions: those with high 56Ni masses (&gt; ~ 0.01 Msun) result in slow-rising, dome-shaped light curves like SN 1987A. Lower 56Ni masses result in low-luminosity, short-plateau light curves resembling some intermediate-luminosity red transients and Type II supernovae like SN 2008bp, which are possible from the explosions of compact blue supergiants and not from the far more extended red supergiants. Our results indicate that blue supergiant explosions are more diverse than SN 1987A-like events and may be hidden among different kinds of transients, explaining the possible discrepancies between the expected fraction of blue supergiants born from binary mergers and the observed fraction of SN 1987A-like supernovae.</p>

<p>2024-07-17, <strong>Testing the cosmic distance duality relation with Type Ia supernova and transverse BAO measurements</strong>, Min Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12250v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.12250v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by comparing the angular diameter distance (ADD) derived from the transverse Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data with the luminosity distance (LD) from the Pantheon type Ia supernova (SNIa) sample. The binning method and Gaussian process are employed to match ADD data with LD data at the same redshift. First, we use nonparametric and parametric methods to investigate the impact of the specific prior values of the absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ from SNIa observations and the sound horizon scale $r_{\rm s}$ from transverse BAO measurements on the CDDR tests. The results obtained from the parametric and non-parametric methods indicate that specific prior values of $M_{\rm B}$ and $r_{\rm s}$ lead to significant biases on the CDDR test. Then, to avoid these biases, we propose a method independent of $M_{\rm B}$ and $r_{\rm s}$ to test CDDR by considering the fiducial value of $\kappa\equiv10^{M_{\rm B} \over 5}r_{\rm s}$ as a nuisance parameter and then marginalizing its influence with a flat prior in the analysis. No violation of the CDDR is found, and the transverse BAO measurement can be used as a powerful tool to verify the validity of CDDR in the cosmological-model-independent method.</p>

<p>In this paper, we have investigated the phase space analysis in modified Galileon cosmology, where the Galileon term is considered a coupled scalar field, $F(\phi)$. We focus on the exponential type function of $F(\phi)$ and the three well-motivated potential functions $V(\phi)$. We obtain the critical points of the autonomous system, along with their stability conditions and cosmological properties. The critical points of the autonomous system describe different phases of the Universe. In the results of our analysis, we have found the scaling solution for critical points, which determine different evolutionary eras for the Universe. The dark-energy-dominated critical points show stable behavior and indicate the Universe’s late-time cosmic acceleration phase. Further, the results are examined with the cosmological data sets of the Hubble rate $H(z)$ and the Supernovae Ia.</p>

<p>2024-07-16, <strong>SN 2021dbg: A Luminous Type IIP-IIL Supernova Exploding from a Massive Star with a Layered Shell</strong>, Zeyi Zhao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11341v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.11341v1</a></p>

<p>We present extensive observations and analysis of supernova (SN) 2021dbg, utilizing optical photometry and spectroscopy. For approximately 385 days following the explosion, SN 2021dbg exhibited remarkable luminosity, surpassing most SNe II. This initial high luminosity is potentially attributed to the interaction between the ejected material and the surrounding circumstellar material (CSM), as evidenced by the pronounced interaction signatures observed in its spectra. The subsequent high luminosity is primarily due to the significant $^{56}$Ni ($0.17 \pm 0.05$ M$_{\odot}$) produced in the explosion. Based on the flux of flash emission lines detected in the initial spectra, we estimate that the CSM mass near the progenitor amounted to $\sim$(1.0–2.0) $\times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$, likely resulting from intense stellar wind activity 2–3 yr preceding the explosion. Considering the bolometric light curve, nebular spectrum modeling, and mass-loss rate, we suggest that the progenitor of SN 2021dbg was a red supergiant (RSG) with a mass of $\sim 20$ M$_{\odot}$ and a radius of 1200 R$_{\odot}$. This RSG featured a thick hydrogen shell, which may have contained a region with a sharp decrease in material density, electron density, and temperature, contributing to its layered structure. This object demonstrates mixed features of SNe IIP and SNe IIL, making it as a transitional event linking the above two subclasses of SNe II.</p>
