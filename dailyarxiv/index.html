<p>2024-12-10, <strong>Multiprobe Cosmology from the Abundance of SPT Clusters and DES Galaxy Clustering and Weak Lensing</strong>, S. Bocquet et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07765v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.07765v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmic shear, galaxy clustering, and the abundance of massive halos each probe the large-scale structure of the universe in complementary ways. We present cosmological constraints from the joint analysis of the three probes, building on the latest analyses of the lensing-informed abundance of clusters identified by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and of the auto- and cross-correlation of galaxy position and weak lensing measurements (3$\times$2pt) in the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We consider the cosmological correlation between the different tracers and we account for the systematic uncertainties that are shared between the large-scale lensing correlation functions and the small-scale lensing-based cluster mass calibration. Marginalized over the remaining $\Lambda$CDM parameters (including the sum of neutrino masses) and 52 astrophysical modeling parameters, we measure $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.300\pm0.017$ and $\sigma_8=0.797\pm0.026$. Compared to constraints from Planck primary CMB anisotropies, our constraints are only 15% wider with a probability to exceed of 0.22 ($1.2\sigma$) for the two-parameter difference. We further obtain $S_8\equiv\sigma_8(\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3)^{0.5}=0.796\pm0.013$ which is lower than the Planck measurement at the $1.6\sigma$ level. The combined SPT cluster, DES 3$\times$2pt, and Planck datasets mildly prefer a non-zero positive neutrino mass, with a 95% upper limit $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.25~\mathrm{eV}$ on the sum of neutrino masses. Assuming a $w$CDM model, we constrain the dark energy equation of state parameter $w=-1.15^{+0.23}_{-0.17}$ and when combining with Planck primary CMB anisotropies, we recover $w=-1.20^{+0.15}_{-0.09}$, a $1.7\sigma$ difference with a cosmological constant. The precision of our results highlights the benefits of multiwavelength multiprobe cosmology.</p>

<p>2024-12-10, <strong>New calculation of the geo-neutrino energy spectrum and its implication</strong>, Yu-Feng Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07711v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.07711v2</a></p>

<p>The energy spectrum of geo-neutrinos plays a vital role in the experimental measurement of geo-neutrinos that have profound implications for both particle physics and earth sciences. In this letter, we present a state-of-the-art calculation of the energy spectrum of geo-neutrinos originating from the beta decay of Uranium-238 and Thorium-232. Our calculation is underpinned by the latest updates in the nuclear database, accounts for previously overlooked forbidden transitions, and incorporates advanced corrections for the beta decay. This brand new geo-neutrino flux model, compared to the widely-used estimates from Enomoto, reveals notable distinction in the energy spectrum shape because of our comprehensive approach. When considering the inverse beta decay (IBD) detection process, our findings show a significant deviation in the predicted IBD yield of around 4% for Uranium-238 and 9% for Thorium-232 decay chains. The implications of using the new geo-neutrino flux model for the experimental analysis are substantial, potentially affecting the analysis results of geo-neutrino measurements of KamLAND and Borexino by around 10% to 20%. Our study represents a significant advancement in geo-neutrino research, establishing a new benchmark for accuracy and reliability in the field.</p>

<p>2024-12-10, <strong>Phenomenological Aspects of Models with Low Scale Seesaw</strong>, Juan Marchant González et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07695v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.07695v1</a></p>

<p>Various phenomenological consequences of seesaw theories for the generation of the fermion mass hierarchy of the Standard Model have been analyzed, with an emphasis on models in which the light-active neutrino masses are derived from low-scale seesaw mechanisms. In particular, fermion masses and lepton flavor-violating decay processes, the flavor-changing neutral current, have been studied, and the implications of these theories for the observed dark matter relic density in the Universe have been determined. From the analysis of these phenomenological aspects, it was possible to determine the allowed parameter spaces of these theories and to obtain a parameter fit consistent with the currently measured experimental values. In this way, correlations between the different observables of the fermionic sector could be obtained, where all values were within the experimental ranges at $3\sigma$. Predictions for new physics consistent with cosmological limits were also obtained.</p>

<p>2024-12-10, <strong>In Search of an Invisible $Z^\prime$</strong>, Joe Davighi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07694v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.07694v1</a></p>

<p>We consider extending the Standard Model by an anomaly-free and possibly flavour non-universal $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry, whose breaking gives a $Z^\prime$ boson that does not affect electroweak precision observables at tree-level or at 1-loop. Provided it does not also couple to electrons, such a $Z^\prime$ boson would be largely invisible to an electroweak precision machine like FCC-ee or CEPC. We show that, while this class of $Z^\prime$ models can also evade tests of quark flavour violation, the constraint of anomaly-cancellation implies that valence quarks, muons, and taus are all charged under $U(1)_X$, with the up quark charge being necessarily large. The conclusion holds even if one augments the SM by three right-handed neutrinos to try and absorb anomalies. This means such $Z^\prime$ bosons cannot simultaneously hide below the TeV scale from $pp \to \ell\ell$ Drell–Yan measurements at the LHC and, even if we entertain esoteric models in which the lepton charges are numerically very small, we cannot escape dijet searches at the LHC. For equitable quark and lepton charges, $pp\to\ell\ell$ already excludes such a $Z^\prime$ up to $M/g \gtrsim$ 10 TeV, with a reach of 20 TeV expected by the end of the High-Luminosity LHC. The dijet bounds currently sit around 5 TeV, while sensitivity up to 10 TeV could be achieved at HL-LHC. We thus find an excellent complementarity between FCC-ee and HL-LHC in covering all anomaly-free $Z^\prime$ bosons up to several TeV.</p>

<p>2024-12-10, <strong>Implementation and investigation of electron-nucleus scattering in NEUT neutrino event generator</strong>, Seisho Abe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07466v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.07466v1</a></p>

<p>Understanding nuclear effects is essential for improving the sensitivity of neutrino oscillation measurements. Validating nuclear models solely through neutrino scattering data is challenging due to limited statistics and the broad energy spectrum of neutrinos. In contrast, electron scattering experiments provide abundant high-precision data with various monochromatic energies and angles. Since both neutrinos and electrons interact via electroweak interactions, the same nuclear models can be applied to simulate both interactions. Thus, high-precision electron scattering data is essential for validating the nuclear models used in neutrino experiments. To enable this, the author has newly implemented electron scattering in the \texttt{NEUT} neutrino event generator, covering two interaction modes: quasielastic (QE) and single pion production. \texttt{NEUT} predictions of QE agree well with numerical calculations, supporting the validity of this implementation. From comparisons with \texttt{NEUT} predictions and inclusive electron scattering data, the momentum-dependent binding energy correction is derived, corresponding to effects beyond the plane wave impulse approximation. The impact of this correction on neutrino interactions is also evaluated. Significant differences in charged lepton kinematics are observed, with approximately 20\,MeV of peak shift in the reconstructed neutrino energy distribution, which is important for accurately measuring neutrino oscillation parameters. It is expected to serve as a foundation for future discussions on electron scattering using \texttt{NEUT}.</p>

<p>2024-12-10, <strong>Germanium target sensed by phonon-mediated kinetic inductance detectors</strong>, Daniele Delicato et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07379v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.07379v1</a></p>

<p>Cryogenic phonon detectors are adopted in experiments searching for dark matter interactions or coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, thanks to the low energy threshold they can achieve. The phonon-mediated sensing of particle interactions in passive silicon absorbers has been demonstrated with Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs). Targets with neutron number larger than silicon, however, feature higher cross section to neutrinos while multi-target absorbers in dark matter experiments would provide a stronger evidence of a possible signal. In this work we present the design, fabrication and operation of KIDs coupled to a germanium absorber, achieving phonon-sensing performance comparable to silicon absorbers. The device introduced in this work is a proof of concept for a scalable neutrino detector and for a multi-target dark matter experiment.</p>

<p>2024-12-10, <strong>The unexpected shape of the primordial black hole mass function</strong>, Jacopo Fumagalli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07709v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.07709v1</a></p>

<p>In a Universe with nearly-Gaussian initial curvature perturbations, the abundance of primordial black holes can be derived from the curvature power spectrum. When the latter is enhanced within a narrow range around a characteristic scale, the resulting mass function has a single distinct peak, corresponding to Schwarzschild radii set by the horizon entry time of that scale. In contrast, we show (both numerically and by providing an analytic estimation) that a broad enhancement - such as a plateau bounded by infrared and ultraviolet scales - produces a bimodal mass function, with a primary peak close to the infrared scale. We find that the typical initial gravitational potential (compaction function), conditioned on meeting the threshold for critical collapse, is generated by a thin spherical shell with infrared radius and a thickness comparable to the ultraviolet scale. This suggests a higher-than-expected abundance of PBH originating from Type II initial fluctuations. Our results significantly impact overproduction bounds on the amplitude of the power spectrum, and tighten the viable mass range for primordial black holes as dark matter.</p>

<p>2024-12-10, <strong>Ultra-compact Objects of Non-minimally Coupled Dark Matter</strong>, Francesco Benetti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07533v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.07533v1</a></p>

<p>In the framework of a collisionless dark matter fluid which is non-minimally coupled to gravity, we investigate the existence and properties of static, spherically symmetric solutions of the general relativistic field equations. We show that the non-minimal coupling originates an (anisotropic) pressure able to counteract gravity and to allow the formation of regular, horizonless ultra-compact objects of dark matter (NMC-UCOs). We then analyze the orbits of massive and massless particles in the gravitational field of NMC-UCOs, providing some specific example and a general discussion in terms of phase portraits. Finally, we study the gravitational lensing effects around NMC-UCOs, and effectively describe these in terms of a pseudo-shadow.</p>

<p>2024-12-10, <strong>The Born approximation in wave optics gravitational lensing revisited</strong>, Hirotaka Yarimoto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07272v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.07272v1</a></p>

<p>Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves provides us with much information about the Universe, including the dark matter distribution at small scales. The information about lensed gravitational waves is encapsulated by an amplification factor, which is calculated by an integration of an oscillatory function. The Born approximation, which has been studied in terms of wave optics in gravitational lensing, may provide a means of overcoming the difficulty in evaluating the oscillating function and better understanding the connection between the amplification factor and the lens mass distribution. In this paper, we revisit the Born approximation for a single lens plane. We find that the distortion of gravitational waves induced by wave optics gravitational lensing is in general connected with the mass distribution of the lens object through a convolution integral, where the scale of the kernel is determined by the Fresnel scale. We then study the validivity and accuracy of the Born approximation specifically for the case of a point mass lens for which the exact analytical expression of the amplicfication factor is available. Using the dimensionless parameter $y$, which represents the normalized impact parameter, and the dimensionless parameter $w$, which denotes the normalized frequency, we show that the $n$-th term of the Born approximation scales as $y^{-2}w^{n-1}$. This indicates that, for the case of a point mass lens, the Born approximation is valid when $w$ is less than 1, with its accuracy scaling as $wy^{-2}$ in this regime.</p>

<p>2024-12-10, <strong>Probing black holes via quasinormal modes in a dark energy-induced dark matter halo</strong>, Jie Liang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07172v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.07172v1</a></p>

<p>This study delves into the existence of dark matter halo around supermassive black holes in galactic cores using a novel gravitational model. By analyzing gravitational waves emitted during the ringdown phase of black holes under different field perturbations, we explore the potential for detecting dark matter halos. The model hypothesizes that the dark matter distribution around black hole is driven by a mechanism where dark energy endows gravitons with mass, thereby forming a new spacetime structure. Results reveal that as relevant parameters increase, the quasinormal modes (QNMs) exhibit a gradual reduction in real parts, with negative imaginary parts whose absolute values also decrease. Moreover, compared to gravitational wave signals from Schwarzschild black hole without dark matter halos, this system demonstrates significant differences in oscillation modes and frequencies. This achievement not only validates the self-consistency of the new gravitational model but also lays a theoretical foundation for subsequent gravitational wave detection within dark matter halo. Simultaneously, it provides new theoretical support for understanding the mechanism of dark energy in large-scale cosmic structures and broadens the research perspective on the relationships between black hole physics, dark matter, and dark energy.</p>

<p>2024-12-10, <strong>Optical Levitation of Arrays of Microspheres</strong>, Benjamin Siegel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07088v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.07088v1</a></p>

<p>Levitated optomechanical systems are rapidly becoming leading tools for precision sensing of forces and accelerations acting on particles in the femtogram to nanogram mass range. These systems enable a high level of control over the sensor’s center-of-mass motion, rotational degrees of freedom, and electric charge state. For many sensing applications, extending these techniques to arrays of sensors enables rejection of correlated noise sources and increases sensitivity to interactions that may be too rare or weak to detect with a single particle. Here we present techniques capable of trapping defect free, two-dimensional arrays of more than 25 microspheres in vacuum. These techniques provide independent control of the optical potential for each sphere. Simultaneous imaging of the motion of all spheres in the array is demonstrated using camera-based imaging, with optimized object tracking algorithms reaching a displacement sensitivity below 1 nm/$\surd$Hz. Such arrays of levitated microspheres may find applications ranging from inertial sensing to searches for weakly interacting particles such as dark matter.</p>

<p>2024-12-10, <strong>Runaway O and Be stars found using Gaia DR3, new stellar bow shocks and search for binaries</strong>, M. Carretero-Castrillo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07738v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.07738v1</a></p>

<p>A relevant fraction of massive stars are runaways, moving with a significant peculiar velocity with respect to their environment. Kicks from supernova explosions or the dynamical ejection of stars from clusters can account for the runaway genesis. We have used Gaia DR3 data to study the velocity distribution of massive O and Be stars from the GOSC and BeSS catalogs and identify runaway stars using a 2D-velocity method. We have discovered 42 new runaways from GOSC and 47 from BeSS, among a total of 106 and 69 runaways found within these catalogs, respectively. These numbers imply a percentage of runaways of ~25% for O-type stars ~5% for Be-type stars. The higher percentages and higher velocities found for O-type compared to Be-type runaways suggest that the dynamical ejection scenario is more likely than the supernova explosion scenario. We have also performed multi-wavelength studies of our runaways. We have used WISE infrared images to discover 13 new stellar bow shocks around the runaway stars. We have also conducted VLA radio observations of some of these bow shocks. Finally, our runaway stars include six X-ray binaries and one gamma-ray binary, implying that new such systems could be found by conducting detailed multi-wavelength studies. In this work we report on this ongoing project to find new runaway stars, study their interaction with the ISM and search for high-energy binary systems.</p>

<p>2024-12-10, <strong>Kick it like DESI: PNGB quintessence with a dynamically generated initial velocity</strong>, Maximilian Berbig et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07418v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.07418v1</a></p>

<p>Motivated by the hint for time-dependent dynamical dark energy from an analysis of the DESI Baryon Accoustic Oscillation (BAO) data together with information from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Supernovae (SN), we relax the assumption of a vanishing initial velocity for a quintessence field. In particular we focus on pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-Boson (PNGB) quintessence in the form of an axion like particle, that can arise as the phase of a complex scalar and could possess derivative couplings to fermions or topological couplings to abelian gauge fields, without upsetting the necessary flatness of its potential. We discuss mechanisms from the aforementioned interactions for sourcing an initial axion field velocity $\dot{\theta_i}$ at redshifts $3\leq z\leq 10$, that will “kick” it into motion. Driven by this initial velocity the axion will first roll up in its potential, similar to “freezing” dark energy. After it has reached the pinnacle of its trajectory, it will start to roll down, and behave as “thawing” quintessence. As a proof of concept we undertake a combined fit to BAO, SN and CMB data at the background level. We find that a scenario with $\dot{\theta_i}=\mathcal{O}(1) \; m_a$, where $m_a$ is the axion mass, is slightly preferred over both $\Lambda$CDM and the conventional “thawing” quintessence with $\dot{\theta_i}=0$. The best fit points for this case exhibit transplanckian decay constants and very flat potentials, which both are in tension with conjectures from string theory.</p>

<p>2024-12-10, <strong>Exploring the circumstellar environment of Tycho’s supernova remnant. II. Impact on the broadband non-thermal emission</strong>, Ryosuke Kobashi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07130v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.07130v1</a></p>

<p>While the environment around Tycho’s supernova remnant (SNR) has long been believed to be close to homogeneous, the latest analysis of Chandra data has identified a substantial deceleration of the forward shock which poses a major challenges to this picture. arXiv:2310.14841 showed that the existence of dense molecular cloud (MC) surrounding a rarefied wind-like circumstellar matter (CSM) can explain this observational finding in term of the shock-expansion dynamics, supporting the so-called single-degenerate scenario for the progenitor system. We here extend this work to study the non-thermal emission processes and investigate whether such an environment is consistent with the observed multi-wavelength spectrum. While the simulated broadband spectrum based on the wind-MC environment is largely consistent with observations, we find that such an environment predicts a harder gamma-ray spectrum than observed due to the relatively low CSM density in the cavity interior of the MC. This difference can be at least partially attributed to the present one-dimensional setup of the model which does not account for the clumpy and multi-dimensional structure of the CSM. Our model provides predictions for the long-term evolution of the broadband spectrum which can be used to further probe Tycho’s surrounding environment in the future, a key to resolving the long-standing issue of type Ia supernova progenitor channels.</p>
