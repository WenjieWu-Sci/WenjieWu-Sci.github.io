<p>2025-02-27, <strong>Generative adversarial neural networks for simulating neutrino interactions</strong>, Jose L. Bonilla et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20244v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.20244v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a new approach to simulate neutrino scattering events as an alternative to the standard Monte Carlo generator approach. Generative adversarial neural network (GAN) models are developed to simulate neutrino-carbon collisions in the few-GeV energy range. The models produce scattering events for a given neutrino energy. GAN models are trained on simulation data from NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. Two GAN models have been obtained: one simulating only quasielastic neutrino-nucleus scatterings and another simulating all interactions at given neutrino energy. The performance of both models has been assessed using two statistical metrics. It is shown that both GAN models successfully reproduce the event distributions.</p>

<p>2025-02-27, <strong>Probing light mediators with recent PandaX-4T low energy electron recoil data</strong>, Mehmet Demirci et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20026v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.20026v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinos elastically scattered off atomic electrons offer a unique opportunity to probe the Standard Model (SM) and beyond SM physics. In this work, we examine the new physics effects of light mediators through elastic neutrino-electron scattering using solar neutrinos at the low energy range of PandaX-4T. These mediators, with a mass less than $1$ GeV, are common properties of extensions to the SM. Accordingly, we consider universal light mediator models involving scalar, vector, and tensor interactions allowed by Lorentz invariance, and the anomaly-free $U(1)’$ extensions of the SM with a new vector mediator such as the $L_e-L_\mu$, $L_e-L_\tau$ and $L_\mu-L_\tau$ gauge models in which the charges are exclusively leptonic. The new physics effects are analyzed by embedding each model into the SM process using solar neutrino flux. We obtain novel constraints on the coupling-mass plane of these models from the latest Run0 and Run1 datasets of the PandaX-4T experiment. We also compare our results with other limits derived from various terrestrial and astrophysical experiments. Our analysis results reveal more stringent limits in some regions of parameter space.</p>

Karadag et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20007v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.20007v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate new physics effects on the framework of Coherent Elastic Neutrino Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) from Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) of neutrinos and generalized neutrino interactions (GNI) as well as the possibility of light mediators from simplified model which includes all possible Lorentz-invariant interactions of vector (V), axialvector (A), scalar (S), pseudoscalar (P), and tensor (T) type. The constraints and the allowed regions at $90\%$ C.L. for masses and couplings in each new physics scenario are derived from the analysis of TEXONO data, including two datasets from 2016 with a high purity $n$-type point-contact (nPC) germanium (Ge) detector and from 2024 with an advanced $p$-type point-contact (pPC) Ge detector. The results are presented in comparison with the current data of COHERENT with CsI and LAr detectors to highlight the complementarity of reactor- and accelerator-based neutrino experiments.</p>

<p>2025-02-27, <strong>Radio Detection of ultra-high-energy Cosmic-Ray Air Showers</strong>, Frank G. Schröder et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19969v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.19969v1</a></p>

<p>Radio antennas have become a standard tool for the detection of cosmic-ray air showers in the energy range above $10^{16}\,$eV. The radio signal of these air showers is generated mostly due to the deflection of electrons and positrons in the geomagnetic field, and contains information about the energy and the depth of the maximum of the air showers. Unlike the traditional air-Cherenkov and air-fluorescence techniques for the electromagnetic shower component, radio detection is not restricted to clear nights, and recent experiments have demonstrated that the measurement accuracy can compete with these traditional techniques. Numerous particle detector arrays for air showers have thus been or will be complemented by radio antennas. In particular when combined with muon detectors, the complementary information provided by the radio antennas can enhance the total accuracy for the arrival direction, energy and mass of the primary cosmic rays. Digitization and computational techniques have been crucial for this recent progress, and radio detection will play an important role in next-generation experiments for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Moreover, stand-alone radio experiments are under development and will search for ultra-high-energy photons and neutrinos in addition to cosmic rays. This article provides a brief introduction to the physics of the radio emission of air showers, an overview of air-shower observatories using radio antennas, and highlights some of their recent results.</p>

<p>IceCube-Gen2, the next generation extension of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole, offers a unique scientific potential for cosmic-ray physics at PeV to EeV energies complementing the main science case of neutrino astronomy. The cosmic-ray science case will be enabled by a surface array on top of an extended optical array deep in the polar ice. The optical array measures TeV muons of air showers, and the surface array primarily measures the electromagnetic shower component and low-energy muons. The design of the surface array foresees scintillation panels providing a full-efficiency threshold for near-vertical proton showers of 0.5 PeV and radio antennas increasing the measurement accuracy for the electromagnetic shower component in the energy range of the Galactic-to-extragalactic transition. Compared to IceCube, the aperture for air showers measured in coincidence with the surface and optical arrays will increase by a factor of 30, due to the larger area and angular acceptance in zenith angle. The science potential includes both, the particle physics of air showers, such as prompt muons, and the astrophysics of the highest energy Galactic cosmic-rays, enabled by the higher sensitivity for the mass composition and anisotropy of cosmic rays, and by the search for PeV photons. This proceeding summarizes the science case and design of the surface array as presented in the recently released IceCube-Gen2 Technical Design Report: https://icecube-gen2.wisc.edu/science/publications/tdr/</p>

<p>2025-02-27, <strong>Probing the PeV Region in the Astrophysical Neutrino Spectrum using $ν_μ$ from the Southern Sky</strong>, R. Abbasi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19776v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.19776v1</a></p>

<p>IceCube has observed a diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux over the energy region from a few TeV to a few PeV. At PeV energies, the spectral shape is not yet well measured due to the low statistics of the data. This analysis probes the gap between 1 PeV and 10 PeV by using high-energy downgoing muon neutrinos. To reject the large atmospheric muon background, two complementary techniques are combined. The first technique selects events with high stochasticity to reject atmospheric muon bundles whose stochastic energy losses are smoothed due to high muon multiplicity. The second technique vetoes atmospheric muons with the IceTop surface array. Using 9 years of data, we found two neutrino candidate events in the signal region, consistent with expectation from background, each with relatively high signal probabilities. A joint maximum likelihood estimation is performed using this sample and an independent 9.5-year sample of tracks to measure the neutrino spectrum. A likelihood ratio test is done to compare the single power-law (SPL) vs. SPL+cutoff hypothesis; the SPL+cutoff model is not significantly better than the SPL. High-energy astrophysical objects from four source catalogs are also checked around the direction of the two events. No significant coincidence was found.</p>

<p>2025-02-27, <strong>Stability of multi-state configurations of fuzzy dark matter</strong>, Francisco S. Guzman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20222v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.20222v1</a></p>

<p>We study the stability properties of multi-state configurations of the Schr"odinger-Poisson system without self-interaction, with monopolar and first dipolar components $(1,0,0)$+$(2,1,0)$. We show these configurations studied are stable using numerical simulations, and using criteria of stationarity, unitarity and time dependence consistency. The study covers a range of states with monopolar to dipolar mass ratio between 47 and 0.17. The astrophysical implication of this result is that this type of configurations is at least stable and can be considered physically sound in multi-state ultralight bosonic dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-02-27, <strong>Unveiling Orbital Chaos: The Wild Heart of Fuzzy Dark Matter Structures</strong>, Ivan Alvarez-Rios et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20205v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.20205v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper we study the behavior of test particles on top of a galactic-type of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) structure, characterized by the core-halo density profile found in simulations. Our workhorse structure is an anisotropic, time-dependent, virialized core-tail FDM clump resulting from a multicore merger. For our analysis we allow this structure to keep evolving, which implies that the core oscillates and accretes matter from the halo, while the halo dynamics is dominated by its characteristic high kinetic energy. On top of this time-dependent structure that in turn has a time-dependent gravitational potential, we solve the motion equations of test particles with initial conditions associated to circular orbits at different radii. Our results indicate that: 1) no trajectory remains circular, 2) the trajectories are sensitive to initial conditions and 3) the departure of initially near trajectories has always a positive Lyapunov exponent. A qualitative result is that the motion of test particles is more erratic with a bigger Lyapunov exponent within and near the core than in the halo region, which can be understood in terms of the random motion of the core within the core-halo structure. We expect these results warn on the importance of the anisotropic and time-dependent nature of FDM clumps when studying the motion of test particles.</p>

<p>2025-02-27, <strong>Self-similar decomposition of the hierarchical merger tree of dark matter halos</strong>, Wenkang Jiang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20181v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.20181v1</a></p>

<p>We show that the merger tree of dark matter halos is approximately self-similar by investigating the universality of the subhalo peak mass function (PMF) describing the mass distribution of progenitor halos. Using a set of cosmological simulations and identifying subhalos of different merger levels with HBT+, we verify that the level-1 subhalo PMF is close to universal across halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. This approximate self-similarity allows us to analytically derive the subhalo PMF for subhalos accreted at any level (i.e., for sub-sub…halos) through self-convolutions of the level-1 PMF, and the resulting model shows good agreement with simulation measurements. We further derive a number of analytical properties on the hierarchical origin of subhalos, including the level distribution, accretion rate at each level, initial merger ratio distribution, and accretion redshift distribution. We find that higher-level subhalos dominate at progressively lower peak mass in the PMF and are more likely to originate from major mergers than lower-level ones. At a given mass ratio at accretion time, the subhalo accretion rates at each level track the growth rate of the host halo. At a fixed final mass ratio, however, the accretion redshift distribution of subhalos depends on the subhalo level, peak mass, and host mass. Higher-level and higher-mass-ratio subhalos tend to be accreted more recently, and more massive halos also accrete their subhalos more recently. Our model provides a concise summary of simulation results and can serve as a basis for further theoretical understanding of the hierarchical structure formation.</p>

<p>2025-02-27, <strong>The COSMOS-Web ring: Spectroscopic confirmation of the background source at z = 5.1</strong>, Marko Shuntov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20136v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.20136v1</a></p>

<p>We report the spectroscopic confirmation of the background source of the most distant Einstein ring known to date, the COSMOS-Web ring. This system consists of a complete Einstein ring at $z=5.1$, lensed by a massive early-type galaxy at $z\sim2$. The redshift $z=5.1043\pm0.0004$ is unambiguously identified with our NOEMA and Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, where the NOEMA observations reveal the CO(4-3) and CO(5-4) lines at $&gt;8\,\sigma$, and the MOSFIRE data detect [O\textsc{ii}] at $\sim 6\,\sigma$. Using multi-wavelength photometry spanning near-infrared to radio bands, we find that the lensed galaxy is a dust-obscured starburst ($M_{\star} \sim 1.8\times10^{10}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$, ${\rm SFR_{IR}\sim 60\,{\rm M_{\odot}} ~yr^{-1}}$) with high star-formation efficiency (gas depletion time $\tau_{\rm dep}&lt;100~$Myr) as indicated by the <a href="1-0">C\textsc{i}</a> non-detection. The redshift confirmation revalidates that the total lens mass budget within the Einstein radius is fully accounted for by the stellar and dark matter components, without the need of modifying the initial mass function or dark matter distribution profile. This work paves the way for detailed studies and future follow-ups of this unique lensing system, providing an ideal laboratory for studying mass distribution at $z\sim2$ and physical conditions of star formation at $z\sim5$.</p>

<p>2025-02-27, <strong>Turbulence and large-scale structures in self-gravitating superfluids</strong>, Sanjay Shukla et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20006v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.20006v1</a></p>

<p>We study turbulence in self-gravitating superfluids by performing direct numerical simulations of the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson (GPP) equation, which is also a model for dark matter haloes around galaxies. In the absence of self-gravity, the spectrally truncated Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation shows the emergence of Kolmogorov’s $5/3$ scaling in the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum. Introducing self-gravity, we observe the formation of spherically collapsed structures, which introduce a minimum in the kinetic energy spectrum that corresponds to the sizes of these structures. The system shows early convergence towards statistically stationary states, which we show by the onset of thermalisation in the compressible kinetic energy spectrum, where $E_{\rm kin}^c \propto k^2$. We also show that the formation of such large-scale structures suggests that the particles (bosons) move from small to large scales through an inverse cascade, supporting a mechanism for the formation of large-scale structures, such as dark matter haloes, around our galaxy Milky Way.</p>

<p>2025-02-27, <strong>Non-interacting holographic dark energy with Torsion via Hubble Radius</strong>, Jungjai Lee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19880v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.19880v1</a></p>

<p>We reconstruct a holographic dark energy model with a scalar torsion $\phi$ under the assumption of no interaction between dark energy and dark matter. We show that the accelerating expansion can occur by setting the IR cut-off to the Hubble radius as $L=H^{-1}$ with the Hubble parameter $H$. Motivated by two physical choices based on Friedmann equations and the holographic principle, tellingly, spin-induced torsion at non-zero matter density $\rho_m \neq 0$ and $H$-dependence of torsion in empty space $\rho_m =0$, we propose a time-dependent scalar torsion $\phi(t) = k H(t) ({\rho_{m}(t)}/ \rho_c^0)$ with a dimensionless constant $k$ and the current critical density $\rho_c^0$. As a result, we find minima $(\omega_X^{0})_{min}$ of the current equation of state for dark energy for various values of the free parameter $c$, yielding $-1 &lt; (\omega_X^{0})_{min} &lt; -0.778$ as $c$ changes from $1$ to $0.654$. Also, we get the values of the current dimensionless ratio, $(\phi_0/H_{0})_{min}$ corresponding to the minima $(\omega^{0}_{X})_{min}$, which is consistent with weak torsion assumption $|\phi_0| /H_{0} &lt; 1$, and thus it ensuring model viability.</p>

<p>2025-02-27, <strong>Low Tc Hafnium Kinetic Inductance Device with High Internal Quality Factor</strong>, Xinran Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19818v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.19818v1</a></p>

<p>Kinetic inductance devices (KIDs) are superconducting resonators with high kinetic inductance sensitive to external energy perturbations. KIDs made with superconductors having $T_c$ far below one Kelvin are of particular interest for sensing minuscule signals, such as light dark matter detection and millimeter wave telescopes for astronomy and cosmology. In this work, we report the promising performance of KIDs fabricated with Hafnium from heated sputter depositions. The KIDs have $T_c$ lower than 249$\pm$2 mK, the internal quality factor ($Q_i$) of the resonators exceeds $10^5$ and the temperature dependence of the resonances can be described by the generalized Mattis-Bardeen model with a disorder parameter $\Gamma=4\times10^{-3}\Delta_0$. Post-fabrication annealing at temperatures above the deposition temperature can further reduce the $T_c$ and $\Gamma$ without reducing $Q_i$, leading to improvements in energy resolution.</p>

<p>2025-02-27, <strong>Axion dark matter searches from the standard halo over the tidal stream to the big flow</strong>, Andrew K. Yi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19817v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.19817v1</a></p>

<p>The sensitivity of axion dark matter searches depends on the signal   window that results from the velocity dispersion of axion dark   matter. Since the ratio of signal windows is about 6500 between the   standard halo and the big flow axion dark matter, each axion dark   matter search usually uses a separate data acquisition (DAQ) channel   with a different frequency resolution bandwidth (RBW).   In this work, we demonstrate axion dark matter searches covering the   standard halo, the tidal stream, and the big flow employing a DAQ   channel starting with a single high resolution RBW, without   sacrificing the DAQ efficiency, where the DAQ process includes   online fast Fourier transforms and writing the outputs to disk.   Assuming the total amount of data is sensitive to   Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitskii (DFSZ) axion dark matter that   follows the standard halo model and makes up 100\% of the local dark   matter density, the same data can also be used for the tidal stream   and the big flow axion dark matter searches that would be sensitive   to DFSZ axion dark matter that constitute 19.2\% and 12.4\% of the   local dark matter densities, respectively, at a 90\% confidence   level.   We also report that the filtering of the individual power spectra   acquired with a relatively high resolution RBW e.g., for the big   flow search can prevent a possible significant degradation in the   signal to noise ratio from the searches in the lower resolution   RBW’s, i.e., the standard halo and tidal stream searches.</p>

<p>2025-02-27, <strong>Beta decay and electron capture rates on manganese isotopes in astrophysical environments</strong>, R. Shehzadi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19813v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.19813v1</a></p>

<p>The isotopes of manganese in the mass range A equal to 53 to 63 are abundant in the core material of high mass stars and are believed to be of prime importance in the progression of the pre collapse phases. During these late evolutionary phases, nuclear processes associated with weak interactions, including decay and electron capture (EC) on these isotopes, significantly alter the Ye (lepton to baryon ratio) of the cores composition. The temporal change of this parameter is one of the basic elements to simulate a successful explosion. Hence, the decay and EC rates of manganese (Mn) nuclides may serve as an important input in the simulation codes of core collapse supernova. In this paper, we focus on the study of the weak decay characteristics of 55 63Mn nuclides. The strength distributions of Gamow Teller transitions in the directions of decay and EC for these isotopes were calculated employing the proton neutron quasi particle random phase approximation (pn QRPA) model. The decay half life values of Mn isotopes under terrestrial conditions were computed and compared with measured data and previous calculations. The pn QRPA estimated half lives are in good agreement with the experimental values. The and EC rates were later calculated covering a large range of stellar temperatures (001 30) 109 K and densities (10 1011) g/cm3.</p>
