<p>2024-07-10, <strong>The Cosmological Preference for Negative Neutrino Mass</strong>, Daniel Green et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07878v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.07878v1</a></p>

<p>The most precise determination of the sum of neutrino masses from cosmological data, derived from analysis of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), favors a value below the minimum inferred from neutrino flavor oscillation experiments. We explore which data is most responsible of this puzzling aspect of the current constraints on neutrino mass and whether it is related to other anomalies in cosmology. We demonstrate conclusively that the preference for negative neutrino masses is a consequence of larger than expected lensing of the CMB in both the two- and four-point lensing statistics. Furthermore, we show that this preference is robust to changes in likelihoods of the BAO and CMB optical depth analyses given the available data. We then show that this excess clustering is not easily explained by changes to the expansion history and is likely distinct from the preference for for dynamical dark energy in DESI BAO data. Finally, we discuss how future data may impact these results, including an analysis of Planck CMB with mock DESI 5-year data. We conclude that the negative neutrino mass preference is likely to persist even as more cosmological data is collected in the near future.</p>

<p>2024-07-10, <strong>Dispersive determination of the fourth generation lepton masses</strong>, Hsiang-nan Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07813v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.07813v1</a></p>

<p>We continue our previous determination of the masses of the sequential fourth generation quarks in an extension of the Standard Model, and predict the mass $m_4$ ($m_L$) of the fourth generation neutrino $\nu_4$ (charged lepton $L$) by solving the dispersion relation associated with heavy fermion decays. The results $m_4\approx 170$ GeV and $m_L\approx 270$ GeVare extracted from the dispersive analyses of the $t\to d e^+\nu_4$ and $L^-\to \nu_1 \bar t d$ decay widths, respectively, where $t$ ($d$, $e^+$, $\nu_1$) denotes a top quark (down quark, positron, light neutrino). The predictions are then cross-checked by examining the $L^-\to \nu_4 \bar u d$ decay, $\bar u$ being an anti-up quark. It is shown that the fourth generation leptons with the above masses survive the current experimental bounds from Higgs boson decays into photon pairs and from the oblique parameters. We also revisit how the existence of the fourth generation leptons impacts the dispersive constraints on the neutrino masses and the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix elements. It is found that the unitarity of the $3\times 3$ PMNS matrix holds well up to corrections of $O(m_\nu^2/m_W^2)$, $m_\nu$ ($m_W$) being a light neutrino (the $W$ boson) mass, whose mixing angles and $CP$ phase prefer the values $\theta_{12}\approx 34^\circ$, $\theta_{23}\approx 46^\circ$, $\theta_{13}\approx 4^\circ$ and $\delta\approx 235^\circ$ in the normal-ordering scenario for neutrino masses. On the contrary, the unitarity of the $3\times 3$ Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix is violated at the level $m_b^2/m_W^2\sim 10^{-3}$, $m_b$ being the $b$ quark mass, as the same formalism is applied to the quark mixing.</p>

<p>2024-07-09, <strong>Association of the IceCube neutrinos with blazars in the CGRaBS sample</strong>, Pouya M. Kouch et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07153v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.07153v1</a></p>

<p>The origin of high-energy (HE) astrophysical neutrinos has remained an elusive hot topic in the field of HE astrophysics for the past decade. Apart from a handful of individual associations, the vast majority of HE neutrinos arise from unknown sources. While there are theoretically-motivated candidate populations, such as blazars – a subclass of AGN with jets pointed towards our line-of-sight – they have not yet been convincingly linked to HE neutrino production. Here, we perform a spatio-temporal association analysis between a sample of blazars (from CGRaBS catalog) in the radio and optical bands and the most up-to-date IceCube HE neutrino catalog. We find that if the IceCube error regions are enlarged by 1$^\circ$ in quadrature, to account for unknown systematic errors at maximal level, a spatio-temporal correlation between the multiwavelength light curves of the CGRaBS blazars and the IceCube HE neutrinos is hinted at least at a 2.17$\sigma$ significance level. On the other hand, when the IceCube error regions are taken as their published values, we do not find any significant correlations. A discrepancy in the blazar-neutrino correlation strengths, when using such minimal and enlarged error region scenarios, was also obtained in a recent study by the IceCube collaboration. In our study, this difference arises because several flaring blazars – coinciding with a neutrino arrival time – happen to narrowly miss the published 90\%-likelihood error region of the nearest neutrino event. For all of the associations driving our most significant correlations, the flaring blazar is much less than 1$^\circ$ away from the published error regions. Therefore, our results indicate that the question of the blazar-neutrino connection is highly sensitive to the reconstruction of the neutrino error regions, whose reliability is expected to improve with the next generation of neutrino observatories.</p>

<p>2024-07-09, <strong>Curved-spacetime dynamics of spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ particles in superposed states from a WKB approximation of the Dirac equation</strong>, F. Hammad et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07139v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.07139v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the dynamics of spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ particles that are freely propagating in superposed states in curved spacetime. We first make use of a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime to extract the corresponding Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations that describe the deviation from geodesic motion as well as the spin precession of such particles. We then discuss, in light of our results, the case of flavour neutrinos which are, by nature, a superposition of mass eigenstates.</p>

<p>2024-07-09, <strong>Combined Fit of Spectrum and Composition for FR0 Radio Galaxy Emitted Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays with Resulting Secondary Photons and Neutrinos</strong>, Jon Paul Lundquist et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06961v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.06961v1</a></p>

<p>This study comprehensively investigates the gamma-ray dim population of Fanaroff-Riley Type 0 (FR0) radio galaxies as potentially significant sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, E $&gt;$ 10$^{18}$ eV) detected on Earth. While individual FR0 luminosities are relatively low compared to the more powerful Fanaroff-Riley Type 1 and Type 2 galaxies, FR0s are substantially more prevalent in the local universe, outnumbering the more energetic galaxies by a factor of $\sim$5 within a redshift of z $\leq$ 0.05.   Employing CRPropa3 simulations, we estimate the mass composition and energy spectra of UHECRs originating from FR0 galaxies for energies above 10$^{18.6}$ eV. This estimation fits data from the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) using three extensive air shower models; both constant and energy-dependent observed elemental fractions are considered. The simulation integrates an isotropic distribution of FR0 galaxies, extrapolated from observed characteristics, with UHECR propagation in the intergalactic medium, incorporating various plausible configurations of extragalactic magnetic fields, both random and structured. We then compare the resulting emission spectral indices, rigidity cutoffs, and elemental fractions with recent Auger results. In total, 25 combined energy spectrum and mass composition fits are considered.   Beyond the cosmic ray fluxes emitted by FR0 galaxies, this study predicts the secondary photon and neutrino fluxes from UHECR interactions with intergalactic cosmic photon backgrounds. The multi-messenger approach, encompassing observational data and theoretical models, helps elucidate the contribution of low luminosity FR0 radio galaxies to the total cosmic ray energy density.</p>

<p>2024-07-09, <strong>Deep-Inelastic Scattering with LHC Neutrinos</strong>, Juan Rojo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06731v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.06731v1</a></p>

<p>The observation of neutrinos produced in LHC collisions by the far-forward FASER and SND@LHC experiments in 2023 herald the new era of collider neutrino physics. These high-intensity forward neutrino fluxes from proton-proton LHC collisions enable novel opportunities in QCD, neutrino physics, BSM searches, and astroparticle physics. In this contribution, we briefly review the physics potential of neutrino deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) measurements at the LHC to shed light on proton and nuclear structure, both for ongoing far-forward experiments and for the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF) to operate concurrently with the HL-LHC. We consider the reach of LHC neutrino DIS to scrutinise the mechanisms of forward hadron production and constrain QCD in the ultra-small-$x$ region. We also discuss how neutrino DIS measurements at these far-forward detectors enhance direct and indirect BSM searches at the HL-LHC.</p>

<p>2024-07-09, <strong>Lepton flavor of four-fermion operator and fermion portal dark matter</strong>, Yuxuan He et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06523v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.06523v1</a></p>

<p>We study the ultraviolet completion of semileptonic four-fermion operator $O_{ledq}^{\alpha \beta 11}$ that incorporates Majorana dark matter (DM) in both lepton-flavor-conserving (LFC) and lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) scenarios at the one-loop level via box diagram, which effectively alleviates the lower bounds on the new physics scale. The interplay between the model-independent constraints on the Wilson coefficients and DM direct detection, relic density, and collider searches in the context of fermion portal DM model with two mediators is investigated. We find that both the projected future constraint on the LFC Wilson coefficient $C_{ledq}^{2211}/\Lambda^2&lt; (12.3~\text{TeV})^{-2}$ from the measurements of neutrino non-standard interaction in the next-generation neutrino oscillation experiments, and LFV constraint $C_{ledq}^{1211}/\Lambda^2&lt; \left(2.2\times 10^3 ~\text{TeV} \right)^{-2}$ from ongoing charged-lepton-flavor-violation searches, provide a complementary exploration of the parameter space encompassing the DM mass and scalar mass. With the colored mediator mass typically around $2~\text{TeV}$, the sensitivity of the indirect constraints on the four-fermion operator could surpass those of collider searches and DM direct detection, in scenarios where the masses of the DM and scalar are close. By ensuring the correct DM relic density, however, we obtain that the collider searches and DM direct detection are more sensitive to the electroweak scale DM and scalar compared to the indirect constraints.</p>

<p>2024-07-10, <strong>Galactic Halos and rotating bosonic dark matter</strong>, Jorge Castelo Mourelle et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07839v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.07839v1</a></p>

<p>Rotating bosonic dark matter halos are considered as potential candidates for modeling dark matter in galactic halos. These bosonic dark matter halos can be viewed as a dilute and very extended version of bosonic stars, and the methods used for the calculation and analysis of the latter objects can be directly applied. Bosonic stars, a hypothetical type of astrophysical objects, are categorized into two primary families, based on the nature of the particles composing them: Einstein-Klein-Gordon stars and Proca stars. We examine various models from both families and the rotation curves which their contribution induces in different galaxies, to identify the most plausible candidates that explain the flattening of orbital velocities observed in galactic halos. By exploring different combinations of our dark matter models with observable galactic features, we propose an interesting source to compensate for the apparent lack of matter in dwarf and spiral galaxies, providing a possible explanation for this longstanding astronomical puzzle.</p>

<p>2024-07-10, <strong>Challenges in modeling the dark matter halo of NGC 1052-DF2: Cored versus cuspy halo models</strong>, K. Aditya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07770v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.07770v1</a></p>

<p>The discovery of NGC 1052-DF2 and subsequent modeling have shown that NGC 1052-DF2 is deficient in dark matter and is in conflict with the standard stellar-to-halo mass ratio. In this work, we aim to resolve the degeneracy between the dynamical models on the mass estimate of the NGC 1052-DF2.We constructed mass models of NGC 1052-DF2 using an anisotropic distribution function with a radially varying anisotropy parameter and studied the effect of the various model parameters on the dark matter estimates. We used the observed stellar photometry as an input parameter to construct the distribution function and employed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to estimate the dark matter model parameters.We find that mass models with a cuspy dark matter halo have comparable $\chi^{2}$ to models with zero dark matter. Moreover, the cuspy dark matter halo fails to consistently account for the observed velocity dispersion in the inner and outer regions of the galaxy. Consequently, we rule out the possibility of a cuspy dark matter halo for describing the mass models of NGC 1052 - DF2. Our study shows that the cored dark matter halo model with a total mass of $\log(M_{DM}/M_{\odot})=10.5$ explains the observed kinematics but requires an extraordinarily large scale length (20kpc) and an outer cutoff radius (26kpc). While the cored mass model provides a comparatively better fit, our findings emphasize that the mass models are largely unconstrained by the available kinematic data. Our results suggest that NGC 1052 - DF2 may not only have an ultra-diffuse stellar distribution but that it can, within uncertainties in the available kinematic data, potentially host an ultra-diffuse dark matter distribution compatible with the standard stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) predicted by galaxy formation and evolution models</p>

<p>2024-07-10, <strong>HSTPROMO Internal Proper Motion Kinematics of Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies: I. Velocity Anisotropy and Dark Matter Cusp Slope of Draco</strong>, Eduardo Vitral et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07769v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.07769v1</a></p>

<p>We analyze four epochs of HST imaging over 18 years for the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We measure precise proper motions (PMs) for hundreds of stars and combine these with existing line-of-sight (LOS) velocities. This provides the first radially-resolved 3D velocity dispersion profiles for any dwarf galaxy. These constrain the intrinsic velocity anisotropy and resolve the mass-anisotropy degeneracy. We solve the Jeans equations in oblate axisymmetric geometry to infer the mass profile. We find the velocity dispersion to be radially anisotropic along the symmetry axis and tangentially anisotropic in the equatorial plane, with a globally-averaged value $\overline{\beta_{\mathrm B}}=-0.20^{+ 0.28}_{- 0.53}$, (where $1 - \beta_{\mathrm B} \equiv \langle v_{\mathrm{ tan}}^2 \rangle / \langle v_{\mathrm{ rad}}^2 \rangle$ in 3D). The logarithmic dark matter (DM) density slope over the observed radial range, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{ dark}}$, is $-0.83^{+ 0.32}_{- 0.37}$, consistent with the inner cusp predicted in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. As expected given Draco’s low mass and ancient star formation history, it does not appear to have been dissolved by baryonic processes. We rule out cores larger than 487, 717, 942 pc at respective 1-, 2-, 3-$\sigma$ confidence, thus imposing important constraints on the self-interacting DM cross-section. Spherical models yield biased estimates for both the velocity anisotropy and the inferred slope. The circular velocity at our outermost data point (900 pc) is $24.19^{+ 6.31}_{- 2.97} \ \mathrm{km~s^{-1}}s$. We infer a dynamical distance of $75.37^{+ 4.73}_{- 4.00}$ kpc, and show that Draco has a modest LOS rotation, with $\left&lt;v / \sigma \right&gt; = 0.22 \pm 0.09$. Our results provide a new stringent test of the so-called `cusp-core’ problem that can be readily extended to other dwarfs.</p>

<p>2024-07-09, <strong>Plasmonic Vortices Host Magnetoelectric Interactions</strong>, Atreyie Ghosh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07206v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.07206v1</a></p>

<p>The vector cross product and pseudoscalar dot products of electric (E) and magnetic (H) fields are separately finite in vacuum transverse electric and magnetic (TEM) plane waves, and angular momentum structured light. Current theories of interactions beyond the standard model of particle physics invoke non-zero dot(E,H) as the source term in the axion law that describes interactions with the cosmological dark matter axion particles outside of the quartet of Maxwells equations. The non-zero dot(E,H) also drives relativistic spin-charge magnetoelectric excitations of axion quasiparticles at a distinctively higher condensed matter scale in magnetic and topological materials. Yet, how to drive coherent dot(E,H) responses is unknown, and provides motivation to examine the field polarizations in structured light on a deep sub-diffraction limited spatial scale and sub-optical cycle temporal scale by ultrafast nonlinear photoemission electron microscopy. By analytical theory and ultrafast coherent photoemission electron microscopy, we image dot(E,H) fields in surface plasmon polariton vortex cores at subwavelength scales, where we find that the magnetoelectric relative to the dipole density is intensified on a ~10 nm diameter scale as a universal property of plasmonic vortex fields. The generation and nanoscale localization of dot(E,H) fields introduces the magnetoelectric symmetry class, having the parity and time reversal broken, but the joint parity-time reversal symmetry preserved. The ability to image the optical fields of plasmonic vortex cores opens the research of ultrafast microscopy of magnetoelectric responses and interactions with axion quasiparticles in solid state materials.</p>

<p>2024-07-09, <strong>Graph Reinforcement Learning for Exploring BSM Model Spaces</strong>, George N. Wojcik et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07203v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.07203v1</a></p>

<p>We present a methodology for performing scans of BSM parameter spaces with reinforcement learning (RL). We identify a novel procedure using graph neural networks that is capable of exploring spaces of models without the user specifying a fixed particle content, allowing broad classes of BSM models to be explored. In theory, the technique is applicable to nearly any model space with a pre-specified gauge group. We provide a generic procedure by which a suitable graph grammar can be developed for any BSM model which features user-specified symmetry groups and a finite number of different possible particle species. As a proof of concept, we construct the graph grammar for theories with vector-like leptons that may or may not be charged under a dark U(1) group, inspired by portal matter extensions of the sub-GeV vector portal/kinetic mixing simplified dark matter models. We then use this graph grammar to create a RL environment tasked with creating models with these vector-like leptons that are consistent with a list of a variety of precision observables. The RL agent succeeds in developing models that can address the observed muon anomalous magnetic moment discrepancy while remaining consistent with flavor violation and electroweak precision observables, including both constructions that have previously been studied as well as new models which have not, to our knowledge, previously been identified. By inspecting the resulting ensembles of models that the agent produces and experimenting with different configurations for our RL environment and graph grammar, we also infer various lessons about the development of these environments that can be transferable to RL scans of more complicated model spaces, and comment on future directions for the development of this technique into a more mature tool.</p>

<p>2024-07-09, <strong>Evidence for large baryonic feedback at low and intermediate redshifts from kinematic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich observations with ACT and DESI photometric galaxies</strong>, B. Hadzhiyska et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07152v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.07152v1</a></p>

<p>Recent advances in cosmological observations have provided an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the distribution of baryons relative to the underlying matter. In this work, we robustly show that the gas is much more extended than the dark matter at 40$\sigma$ and the amount of baryonic feedback at $z \lesssim 1$ strongly disfavors low-feedback models such as that of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG compared with high-feedback models such as that of the original Illustris simulation. This has important implications for bridging the gap between theory and observations and understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Furthermore, a better grasp of the baryon-dark matter link is critical to future cosmological analyses, which are currently impeded by our limited knowledge of baryonic feedback. Here, we measure the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (kSZ) effect from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), stacked on the luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging survey. This is the first analysis to use photometric redshifts for reconstructing galaxy velocities. Due to the large number of galaxies comprising the DESI imaging survey, this is the highest signal-to-noise stacked kSZ measurement to date: we detect the signal at 13$\sigma$ and find that the gas is more spread out than the dark matter at $\sim$40$\sigma$. Our work opens up the possibility to recalibrate large hydrodynamical simulations using the kSZ effect. In addition, our findings point towards a way of alleviating inconsistencies between weak lensing surveys and cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments such as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">low $S\_8$' tension, and shed light on long-standing enigmas in astrophysics such as the </code>missing baryon’ problem.</p>

<p>Galaxies are not in a dynamical steady state. They continually undergo perturbations, e.g., from infalling dwarf galaxies and dark-matter substructure. After a dynamical perturbation, stars phase mix towards a new steady state; in so doing they generally form spiral structures, such as spiral density waves in galaxy disks and the Gaia Snail observed in the vertical phase-space density in the solar neighborhood. Structures in phase-space density can be hard to measure accurately, because spatially varying selection effects imprint their own patterns on the density. However, stellar labels such as metallicity, or other element abundances, or stellar masses and ages, can be measured even in the face of complex or unknown spatial selection functions. We show that if the equilibrium galaxy has phase-space gradients in these labels, any perturbation that could raise a spiral wave in the phase-space density will raise a spiral wave in the distribution of labels as well. We work out the relationship between the spiral patterns in the density and in the labels. As an example, we analyze the Gaia Snail and show that its amplitude and dynamical age as derived from elemental abundances (mainly [Mg/Fe]) follow similar patterns to those derived from the phase-space density. Our best model dates the Snail’s perturbation to about 400 Myr ago although we find significant variations with angular momentum in the best-fit age. Conceptually, the ideas presented here are related to Orbital Torus Imaging, chemical tagging, and other methods that use stellar labels to trace dynamics.</p>

<p>2024-07-09, <strong>QCD Axion Dark Matter in String Theory: Haloscopes and Helioscopes as Probes of the Landscape</strong>, Naomi Gendler et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07143v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.07143v1</a></p>

<p>Laboratory experiments have the capacity to detect the QCD axion in the next decade, and precisely measure its mass, if it composes the majority of the dark matter. In type IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds in the geometric regime, the QCD axion mass, $m_a$, is strongly correlated with the topological Hodge number $h^{1,1}$. We compute $m_a$ in a scan of $185{,}965$ compactifications of type IIB string theory on toric hypersurface Calabi-Yau threefolds. We compute the range of $h^{1,1}$ probed by different experiments under the condition that the QCD axion can provide the observed dark matter density with minimal fine-tuning. Taking the experiments DMRadio, ADMX, MADMAX, and BREAD as indicative on different mass ranges, the $h^{1,1}$ distributions peak near $h^{1,1}=24.9, \ 65.4, \ 196.8,$ and $310.9,$ respectively. We furthermore conclude that, without severe fine tuning, detection of the QCD axion as dark matter \emph{at any mass} disfavours 80% of models with $h^{1,1} =491$, which is thought to have the most known Calabi-Yau threefolds. Measurement of the solar axion mass with IAXO is the dominant probe of all models with $h^{1,1}\gtrsim 250$. This study demonstrates the immense importance of axion detection in experimentally constraining the string landscape.</p>

<p>We present a method to directly detect the axion dark matter using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds. In particular, we use metrology leveraging the nuclear spin of nitrogen to detect axion-nucleus couplings. This is achieved through protocols designed for dark matter searches, which introduce a novel approach of quantum sensing techniques based on the nitrogen vacancy center. Although the coupling strength of the magnetic fields with nuclear spins is three orders of magnitude smaller than that with electron spins for conventional magnetometry, the axion interaction strength with nuclear spins is the same order of magnitude as that with electron spins. Furthermore, we can take advantage of the long coherence time by using the nuclear spins for the axion dark matter detection. We show that our method is sensitive to a broad frequency range $\lesssim 100\,\mathrm{Hz}$ corresponding to the axion mass $m_a \lesssim 4\times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{eV}$. We present the detection limit of our method for both the axion-neutron and the axion-proton couplings and discuss its significance in comparison with other proposed ideas.</p>

<p>The first stars formed over five orders of magnitude in mass by accretion in primordial dark matter halos. We study the evolution of massive, very massive and supermassive primordial (Pop III) stars over nine orders of magnitude in accretion rate. We use the stellar evolution code GENEC to evolve accreting Pop III stars from 10$^{-6}$ - 10$^3$ M$_\odot$/yr and study how these rates determine final masses. The stars are evolved until either the end of central Si burning or until they encounter the general relativistic instability (GRI). We also examine how metallicity affects the evolution of the stars. At rates below $2.5 x 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$/yr the final mass of the star falls below that required for pair-instability supernovae. The minimum rate required to produce black holes with masses above 250 M$_\odot$ is $5 x 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$/yr, well within the range of infall rates found in numerical simulations of halos that cool via H$_2$, $10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$/yr. At rates of $5 x 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$/yr to $4 x 10^{-2}$ \Ms\ yr$^{-1}$, like those expected for halos cooling by both H$_2$ and Ly-alpha, the star collapses after Si burning. At higher accretion rates the GRI triggers the collapse of the star during central H burning. Stars that grow at above these rates are cool red hypergiants with effective temperatures $log(T_{\text{eff}}) = 3.8$ and luminosities that can reach 10$^{10.5}$ L$_\odot$. At accretion rates of 100 - 1000 M$_\odot$/yr the gas encounters the general relativistic instability prior to the onset of central hydrogen burning and collapses to a black hole with a mass of 10$^6$ M$_\odot$ without ever having become a star. We reveal for the first time the critical transition rate in accretion above which catastrophic baryon collapse, like that which can occur during galaxy collisions in the high-redshift Universe, produces supermassive black holes via dark collapse.</p>

<p>This study reanalyzes the detection prospects of dark matter (DM) annihilation signals in the Galactic Center, focusing on velocity-dependent dynamics within a spike density near the supermassive black hole (Sgr~A$^{\star}$). We investigate three annihilation processes – $p$-wave, resonance, and forbidden annihilation – under semi-relativistic velocities, leveraging gamma-ray data from Fermi and DAMPE telescopes. Our analysis integrates a fermionic DM model with an electroweak axion-like particle (ALP) portal, exploring annihilation into two or four photons. Employing a comprehensive six-dimensional integration, we precisely calculate DM-induced gamma-ray fluxes near Sgr~A$^{\star}$, incorporating velocity and positional dependencies in the annihilation cross-section and photon yield spectra. Our findings highlight scenarios of resonance and forbidden annihilation, where the larger ALP-DM-DM coupling constant $C_{a\chi\chi}$ can affect spike density, potentially yielding detectable gamma-ray line spectra within Fermi and DAMPE energy resolution. We set upper limits for $C_{a\chi\chi}$ across these scenarios, offering insights into the detectability and spectral characteristics of DM annihilation signals from the Galactic Center.</p>

<p>The classical conservation of the lepton number is an accidental symmetry present in the Standard Model (SM). Thus, we consider here a scenario where the SM is extended with a U(1) gauge group, promoting the lepton number to a local symmetry. The gauge anomaly cancellations necessitate the extension of the particle spectrum with several beyond the SM (BSM) particle fields. The extended lepton gauge group breaks around the TeV scale via spontaneous symmetry breaking, and a $Z_2$ symmetry remains, which ensures the stability of the light $Z_2$ odd BSM particles. Interestingly, the particle spectrum of the model has two distinct dark sectors, with one having a Dirac-type DM and the other one containing a Majorana-type DM, thus resulting in a multipartite dark matter scenario. We have explored the available parameter space consistent with the observed dark matter relic density and direct detection measurements for both of the DM particles. Having a Majorana dark matter, we have also studied for the gamma line signatures to constrain the parameter space from the indirect dark matter detection experiments like FermiLAT and CTA.</p>

<p>We present the results of a set of cosmological N-body simulations with standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology but characterized by a scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type featuring a power-law dependence of the $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}(k)$ at large scales followed by a saturation to a constant value at smaller scales where non-linear growth leads to the formation of collapsed cosmic structures. Such models are built to ensure consistency with current Cosmic Microwave Background bounds on primordial non-Gaussianity yet allowing for large effects of the non-Gaussian statistics on the properties of non-linear structure formation. We show the impact of such scale-dependent non-Gaussian scenarios on a wide range of properties of the resulting cosmic structures, such as the non-linear matter power spectrum, the halo and sub-halo mass functions, the concentration-mass relation, the halo and void density profiles, and we highlight for the first time that some of these models might mimic the effects of Warm Dark Matter for several of such observables</p>

<p>General relativity and quantum field theory govern all fundamental physical processes, from nuclear and subatomic scales to the solar system, galactic, and cosmology. Both theories work remarkably well in their tested domains. However, there is minimal overlap between the two domains. Our work demonstrates that the non-overlapping of domains \emph{no longer} holds when non-perturbative effects are considered. We introduce a novel mechanism in which the gravitons acquire \emph{effective mass} due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of global or local symmetry of complex scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. In the flat space-time limit, we demonstrate that the resulting action for the graviton is identical to the extended Fierz-Pauli (FP) action, corresponding to the mass deformation parameter $\alpha = 1/2$. The extended FP action has 6 Degrees of freedom and no ghost. For local $U(1)$ SSB, we establish that the effective graviton mass is related to the mass of the gauge boson and the electric charge of the complex scalar field. Interestingly, our results indicate that the millicharged dark matter scalar fields, generating dark photons, can produce graviton mass of the same order as the Hubble constant $(H_0)$. Hence, we argue that the dark sector offers a natural explanation for the acceleration of the current Universe.</p>

<p>2024-07-10, <strong>Extended gamma-ray emission from particle escape in pulsar wind nebulae – Application to HESS J1809-193 and HESS J1825-137</strong>, Pierrick Martin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07583v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.07583v1</a></p>

<p>There is growing evidence from gamma-ray observations at high and very high energies that particle escape is a key aspect shaping the morphological properties of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) at various evolutionary stages. We aim to provide a simple model for the gamma-ray emission from these objects including the transport of particles across the different components of the system. We applied it to sources HESS J1809-193 and HESS J1825-137. We developed a multi-zone framework applicable to dynamically young PWNe, taking into account the diffusive escape of relativistic electron-positron pairs out of the nebula into the parent supernova remnant (SNR) and their confinement downstream of the magnetic barrier of the forward shock until an eventual release into the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). For a wide range of turbulence properties in the nebula, the GeV-TeV inverse-Compton radiation from pairs that escaped into the remnant can be a significant if not dominant contribution to the emission from the system. It may dominate the pion-decay radiation from cosmic rays accelerated at the forward shock and advected downstream of it. In the TeV-PeV range, the contribution from particles escaped into the ISM can exceed by far that of the SNR+PWN components. Applied to HESS J1809-193 and HESS J1825-137, we found that spatially extended GeV-TeV emission components can be accounted for mostly from particles escaped into the ISM, while morphologically more compact components above 50-100TeV are ascribed to the PWNe. In these two cases, the model suggests high turbulence in the nebula and a forward shock accelerating cosmic rays up to ~100TeV at most. The model provides the temporal and spectral properties of the flux of particles originally energized by the pulsar wind and ultimately released in the ISM. (Abridged).</p>

<p>Cosmic rays are energetic nuclei that permeate the entire Galactic disk. Their existence requires the presence of powerful particle accelerators. While Galactic supernova explosions may supply the required energy, there is growing evidence that they cannot explain all of the observed properties of cosmic rays, such as their maximum particle energy and isotopic composition. Among Galactic objects, winds from stellar clusters meet the energetic requirement and provide a suitable environment for particle acceleration. The recent detection of some of these objects in gamma rays confirms that they indeed harbor high-energy particles.However, as most supernovae explode inside stellar clusters, it is difficult to distinguish the contribution of winds to particle acceleration. Here we report the detection of young star clusters in the nearby Vela molecular ridge star forming region. The young age of the systems guarantees an unbiased estimate of the stellar CR luminosity free from any supernova or pulsar contamination and allows us to draw conclusions on the acceleration efficiency and the total power supplied by these objects. We demonstrate that much more than 1% of the wind mechanical power is converted into CRs and consequently conclude that a small but non-negligible fraction ~ 1-10% of the CR population is contributed by stellar clusters.</p>

<p>A rare subclass of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), named after the prototype SN 2003fg, includes some of the brightest SNe Ia, often called “super Chandrasekhar-mass” SNe Ia. We calculate the $\gamma$-ray deposition histories and the $^{56}$Ni mass synthesized in the explosion, $M_\mathrm{Ni56}$, for eight 2003fg-like SNe. Our findings reveal that the $\gamma$-ray escape time, $t_0$, for these objects is $ t_0\approx45\text{-}60 \,$ days, significantly higher than that of normal SNe Ia. 2003fg-like SNe are distinct from normal SNe Ia in the $ t_0 $-$ M_\mathrm{Ni56} $ plane, with a noticeable gap between the two populations. The observed position of 2003fg-like SNe in this plane poses a significant challenge for theoretical explosion models. We demonstrate that the merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) and a single star exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit fail to reproduce the observed $ t_0 $-$ M_\mathrm{Ni56} $ distribution. However, preliminary calculations of head-on collisions of massive WDs show agreement with the observed $ t_0 $-$ M_\mathrm{Ni56} $ distribution.</p>

<p>We present a comprehensive test of the cosmic distance duality relation (DDR) using a combination of strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delay measurements and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data. We investigate three different parameterizations of potential DDR violations. To bridge the gap between SGL and SNe Ia datasets, we implement an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to reconstruct the distance modulus of SNe Ia. Our analysis uniquely considers both scenarios where the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia ($M_B$) is treated as a free parameter and where it is fixed to a Cepheid-calibrated value. Using a sample of six SGL systems and the Pantheon+ SNe Ia dataset, we find no statistically significant evidence for DDR violations across all parameterizations. The consistency of our findings across different parameterizations not only reinforces confidence in the standard DDR but also demonstrates the robustness of our analytical approach.</p>

<p>Boasting a 6.5m mirror in space, JWST can increase by several times the number of supernovae (SNe) to which a redshift-independent distance has been measured with a precision distance indicator (e.g., TRGB or Cepheids); the limited number of such SN calibrators currently dominates the uncertainty budget in distance ladder Hubble constant (H0) experiments. JWST/NIRCAM imaging of the Virgo Cluster galaxy NGC4536 is used here to preview JWST program GO-1995, which aims to measure H0 using three stellar distance indicators (Cepheids, TRGB, JAGB/carbon stars). Each population of distance indicator was here successfully detected – with sufficiently large number statistics, well-measured fluxes, and characteristic distributions consistent with ingoing expectations – so as to confirm that we can acquire distances from each method precise to about 0.05mag (statistical uncertainty only). We leverage overlapping HST imaging to identify TRGB stars, cross-match them with the JWST photometry, and present a preliminary constraint on the slope of the TRGB’s F115W-(F115W}-F444W) relation equal to -0.99 +/- 0.16 mag/mag. This slope is consistent with prior slope measurements in the similar 2MASS J-band, as well as with predictions from the BASTI isochrone suite. We use the new TRGB slope estimate to flatten the two-dimensional TRGB feature and measure a (blinded) TRGB distance relative to a set of fiducial TRGB colors, intended to represent the absolute fiducial calibrations expected from geometric anchors such as NGC4258 and the Magellanic Clouds. In doing so, we empirically demonstrate that the TRGB can be used as a standardizable candle at the IR wavelengths accessible with JWST.</p>

<p>Interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and dense circumstellar medium (CSM) with a flat density structure ($\rho \propto r^{-s}, s &lt; 1.5$) was recently proposed as a possible mechanism behind interacting SNe that exhibit exceptionally long rise times exceeding 100 days. In such a configuration, the interaction luminosity keeps rising until the reverse shock propagates into the inner layers of the SN ejecta. We investigate the light curves of SNe interacting with a flatly distributed CSM in detail, incorporating the effects of photon diffusion inside the CSM into the model. We show that three physical processes - the shock breakout, the propagation of the reverse shock into the inner ejecta, and the departure of the shock from the dense CSM - predominantly determine the qualitative behaviour of the light curves. Based on the presence and precedence of these processes, the light curves of SNe interacting with flatly distributed CSM can be classified into five distinct morphological classes. We also show that our model can qualitatively reproduce doubly peaked SNe whose peaks are a few tens of days apart, such as SN 2005bf and SN 2022xxf. Our results show that the density distribution of the CSM is an important property of CSM that contributes to the diversity in light curves of interacting SNe.</p>

<p>Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are X-ray flares lasting minutes to hours. Multi-wavelength counterparts to these FXTs have been proven hard to find. As a result distance measurements are through indirect methods such as host galaxy identification. The three main models proposed for FXTs; supernova shock breakout emission (SN SBO), binary neutron star (BNS) mergers and tidal dirsuption events (TDEs) of an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) disrupting a white dwarf (WD), have a different associated L$_{X, peak}$. Therefore obtaining the distance to FXTs will be a powerful probe to investigate the nature of these FXTs. We use VLT/MUSE observations of a sample of FXTs to report the redshift of between 13 and 22 galaxies per FXT and use these redshifts to calculate the distance, L$_{X, peak}$ and the projected offsets. We find L$_{X, peak}&gt;10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ if we assume any of the sources with a redshift measurement is the true host galaxy of the corresponding FXT. For XRT 100831 we find a very faint galaxy within the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty region with a chance alignment probability of 0.04. For XRT 060207 we find a candidate host galaxy at z = 0.939 with a low chance alignment probability. However, we also report the detection of a late-type star within the 3$\sigma$ uncertainty region with a similar chance alignment probability. For the remaining FXTs we find no sources within their 3$\sigma$ uncertainty regions. We rule out a SN SBO nature for all FXTs based on L$_{X, peak}$ and the projected offsets. For XRT 100831 we conclude the detected galaxy within the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty position is likely to be the host galaxy of this FXT. From the available information, we are not able to determine if XRT 060207 originated from the galaxy found within 1$\sigma$ of the FXT position or was due to a flare from the late-type star detected within the 3$\sigma$ uncertainty region.</p>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unearthed black holes as massive as $10^{6.2-8.1}M_\odot$ at redshifts of $z \sim 8.5-10.6$ with many systems showing unexpectedly high black hole to stellar mass ratios &gt;=30%, posing a crucial challenge for theoretical models. Using analytic calculations, we explore the combination of {\it astrophysical} seeding mechanisms and Eddington accretion rates that can explain the observed objects. We then appeal to {\it cosmological} primordial black hole (PBH) seeds and show how these present an alternative path for “seeding” early structures and their baryonic contents. Assuming seeding (via astrophysical means) at a redshift of $z_{\rm seed}=25$ and continuous accretion, all of the black holes studied here can either be explained through super-Eddington accretion (at an Eddington fraction of $f_{\rm Edd}&lt;= 2.1 $) onto low-mass ($100M_\odot$) seeds or Eddington-limited accretion onto high-mass ($10^5 M_\odot$) seeds. The upper limit, where we assume a primordial origin for all of these black holes, yields a continuous primordial black hole mass function (between $10^{-5.25}$ and $10^{3.75} M_\odot$) and a fractional PBH value $&lt;= 10^{-12}$, in good agreement with observational constraints. Starting at the redshift of matter-radiation equality ($z \sim 3400$), we show how PBH-driven structure formation can reproduce the observed stellar and black hole masses for two of the highest redshift black holes (UHZ1 and GHZ9 at $z \sim 10.3$) with the same parameters governing star formation, black hole accretion and their feedbacks. Exploring a wide swathe of model parameter space for GHZ9, we find black hole-to-stellar mass ratios ranging between $0.1-1.86$ i.e. in some cases (of high supernova feedback), the black hole grows to be more massive than its host halo, presenting an attractive alternative to seeding these puzzling early systems.</p>

<p>The first stars formed over five orders of magnitude in mass by accretion in primordial dark matter halos. We study the evolution of massive, very massive and supermassive primordial (Pop III) stars over nine orders of magnitude in accretion rate. We use the stellar evolution code GENEC to evolve accreting Pop III stars from 10$^{-6}$ - 10$^3$ M$_\odot$/yr and study how these rates determine final masses. The stars are evolved until either the end of central Si burning or until they encounter the general relativistic instability (GRI). We also examine how metallicity affects the evolution of the stars. At rates below $2.5 x 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$/yr the final mass of the star falls below that required for pair-instability supernovae. The minimum rate required to produce black holes with masses above 250 M$_\odot$ is $5 x 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$/yr, well within the range of infall rates found in numerical simulations of halos that cool via H$_2$, $10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$/yr. At rates of $5 x 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$/yr to $4 x 10^{-2}$ \Ms\ yr$^{-1}$, like those expected for halos cooling by both H$_2$ and Ly-alpha, the star collapses after Si burning. At higher accretion rates the GRI triggers the collapse of the star during central H burning. Stars that grow at above these rates are cool red hypergiants with effective temperatures $log(T_{\text{eff}}) = 3.8$ and luminosities that can reach 10$^{10.5}$ L$_\odot$. At accretion rates of 100 - 1000 M$_\odot$/yr the gas encounters the general relativistic instability prior to the onset of central hydrogen burning and collapses to a black hole with a mass of 10$^6$ M$_\odot$ without ever having become a star. We reveal for the first time the critical transition rate in accretion above which catastrophic baryon collapse, like that which can occur during galaxy collisions in the high-redshift Universe, produces supermassive black holes via dark collapse.</p>

<p>2024-07-09, <strong>All known Type Ia supernovae models fail to reproduce the observed bolometric luminosity-width correlation</strong>, Amir Sharon et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06859v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.06859v1</a></p>

<p>Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are widely believed to arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs (WDs). However, ongoing debate surrounds their progenitor systems and the mechanisms triggering these explosions. Recently, Sharon \&amp; Kushnir showed that existing models do not reproduce the observed positive correlation between the $\gamma$-ray escape time, $t_0$, and the synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass, $M_\mathrm{Ni56}$. Their analysis, while avoiding complex radiation transfer (RT) calculations, did not account for the viewing-angle dependence of the derived $t_0$ and $M_\mathrm{Ni56}$ in multi-dimensional (multi-D) models during pre-nebular phases, where most observations performed. Here, we aim to identify an observational width-luminosity relation, similar to the $t_0$-$M_\mathrm{Ni56}$ relation to constrain multi-D models during pre-nebular phases while minimizing RT calculation uncertainties. We show that the bolometric luminosity at $t\le30$ days since explosion can be accurately computed without non-thermal ionization considerations, which are computationally expensive and uncertain. We find that the ratio of the bolometric luminosity at 30 days since explosion to the peak luminosity, $L_{30}/Lp$, correlates strongly with $t_0$. Using a sample of well-observed SNe Ia, we show that this parameter tightly correlates with the peak luminosity, $L_p$. We compare the observed $L_{30}/Lp$-$L_p$ distribution with models from the literature, including non-spherical models consisting of head-on WD collisions and off-centered ignitions of sub-Chandrasekhar mass WDs. We find that all known SNe Ia models fail to reproduce the observed bolometric luminosity-width correlation.</p>

<p>More than 3000 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are presented in the Zwicky Transient Facility SN Ia Data Release 2 (ZTF DR2). In this paper, we detail the spectral properties of 482 SNe Ia near maximum light, up to a redshift limit of $z$ $\leq$ 0.06. We measure the velocities and pseudo-equivalent widths (pEW) of key spectral features (Si II $\lambda$5972 and Si II $\lambda$6355) and investigate the relation between the properties of the spectral features and the photometric properties from the SALT2 light-curve parameters as a function of spectroscopic sub-class. We discuss the non-negligible impact of host galaxy contamination on SN Ia spectral classifications, as well as investigate the accuracy of spectral template matching of the ZTF DR2 sample. We define a new subclass of underluminous SNe Ia (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">04gs-like') that lie spectroscopically between normal SNe Ia and transitional 86G-like SNe Ia (stronger Si II $\lambda$5972 than normal SNe Ia but significantly weaker Ti II features than </code>86G-like’ SNe). We model these <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">04gs-like' SN Ia spectra using the radiative-transfer spectral synthesis code tardis and show that cooler temperatures alone are unable to explain their spectra; some changes in elemental abundances are also required. However, the broad continuity in spectral properties seen from bright (</code>91T-like’) to faint normal SN Ia, including the transitional and 91bg-like SNe Ia, suggests that variations within a single explosion model may be able to explain their behaviour.</p>

<p>2024-07-09, <strong>Comments on the prior dependence of the DESI results</strong>, Vrund Patel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06586v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.06586v1</a></p>

<p>In this short contribution, we explore the prior dependence of the recent DESI results, according to which a Bayesian comparison of $\Lambda$CDM with $w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies favors dynamical dark energy. It is a simple exercise to show that extending the prior lower bound of the dark energy parameters tilts the preference in favor of $\Lambda$CDM. Adopting the PantheonPlus supernovae catalog, for instance, a shift of the lower bound for $w_0,w_a$ from $-3$ to beyond $-4.6$ and $-5$, respectively, is sufficient to favor $\Lambda$CDM. This calls for caution when interpreting DESI results in the Bayesian context.</p>
