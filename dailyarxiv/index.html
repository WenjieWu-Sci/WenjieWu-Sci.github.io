<p>2025-01-09, <strong>Not-Quite-Transcendental Functions For Logarithmic Interpolation of Tabulated Data</strong>, Peter C. Hammond et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05410v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.05410v1</a></p>

<p>From tabulated nuclear and degenerate equations of state to photon and neutrino opacities, to nuclear reaction rates: tabulated data is ubiquitous in computational astrophysics. The dynamic range that must be covered by these tables typically spans many orders of magnitude. Here we present a novel strategy for accurately and performantly interpolating tabulated data that spans these large dynamic ranges. We demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy in tabulated lookups for nuclear and terrestrial equations of state. We show that this strategy is a faster \textit{drop-in} replacement for linear interpolation of logarithmic grids.</p>

<p>2025-01-09, <strong>First observation of reactor antineutrinos by coherent scattering</strong>, N. Ackermann et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05206v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.05206v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinos are elementary particles that interact only very weakly with matter. Neutrino experiments are therefore usually big, with masses on the multi-ton scale. The thresholdless interaction of coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos on atomic nuclei leads to drastically enhanced interaction rates, that allows for much smaller detectors. The study of this process gives insights into physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The Conus+ experiment was designed to first detect elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering in the fully coherent regime with low-energy neutrinos produced in nuclear reactors. For this purpose, semiconductor detectors based on high-purity germanium crystals with extremely low energy threshold of 160-180 eV were developed. Here we show the first observation of a neutrino signal with a statistical significance of 3.7 sigma from the Conus+ experiment, operated at the nuclear power plant in Leibstadt, Switzerland. In 119 days of reactor operation (395$\pm$106) neutrinos were measured compared to a predicted number from simulations assuming standard model physics of (347$\pm$34) events. The good agreement between data and prediction constrains many parameters in various theoretical models. With increased precision, there is potential for fundamental discoveries in the future. The Conus+ results in combination with other measurements of this interaction channel might therefore mark a starting point for a new era in neutrino physics.</p>

<p>2025-01-09, <strong>Hierarchies from deterministic non-locality in theory space Anderson localisation</strong>, Ketan M. Patel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05137v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.05137v1</a></p>

<p>The nearest-neighbour or local mass terms in theory space among quantum fields, with their generic disordered values, are known to lead to the localisation of mass eigenstates, analogous to Anderson localisation in a one-dimensional lattice. This mechanism can be used to create an exponential hierarchy in the coupling between two fields by placing them at opposite ends of the lattice chain. Extending this mechanism, we show that when copies of such fields are appropriately attached to the lattice chain, it leads to the emergence of multiple massless modes. These vanishing masses are a direct consequence of the locality of interactions in theory space. The latter may break down in an ordered and deterministic manner through quantum effects if additional interactions exist among the chain fields. Such non-locality can induce small masses for the otherwise massless modes without necessarily delocalising the mass eigenstates. We provide examples of interactions that preserve or even enhance localisation. Applications to flavour hierarchies, neutrino mass, and the $\mu$-problem in supersymmetric theories are discussed.</p>

<p>2025-01-09, <strong>Many body gravity and the bullet cluster</strong>, S. Ganesh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05126v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.05126v1</a></p>

<p>Many body gravity (MBG) is an alternate theory of gravity, which has been able to explain the galaxy rotation curves, the radial acceleration relation (RAR) and the wide binary stars (WBS). The genesis of MBG is a novel theory, which models systems with thermal gradients, by recasting the variation in the temperature as a variation in the metric. Merging the above concept with Einstein’s gravity, leads to the theory of thermal gravity in 5-D space-time-temperature. Thermal gravity when generalized for partially thermalized systems, results in the theory of many body gravity. The bullet cluster is supposed to be a smoking gun evidence for the presence of dark matter. However, this work demonstrates that the MBG theory can explain the weak gravitational lensing effect of the bullet cluster, without the need for yet undiscovered baryonic matter or dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-01-09, <strong>Dwarf Galaxy Integral-field Survey (DGIS): survey overview and the result of global mass-metallicity relation</strong>, Xin Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04943v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.04943v1</a></p>

<p>Low-mass galaxies are the building blocks of massive galaxies in the framework of hierarchical structure formation. To enable detailed studies of galactic ecosystems in dwarf galaxies by spatially resolving different galactic components, we have carried out the Dwarf Galaxy Integral-field Survey (DGIS). This survey aims to acquire observations with spatial resolutions as high as 10 to 100 pc while maintaining reasonably high signal-to-noise ratios with VLT/MUSE and ANU-2.3m/WiFeS. The whole sample will be composed of 65 dwarf galaxies with $M_{\rm \ast}$ $&lt;$ 10$^{9}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$, selected from the Spitzer Local Volume Legacy Survey. The overall scientific goals include studying baryonic cycles in dwarf galaxies, searching for off-nuclear (intermediate)-massive black holes, and quantifying the inner density profiles of dark matter. In this work, we describe the sample selection, data reduction, and high-level data products. By integrating the spectra over the field of view for each galaxy, we obtained the integrated gas-phase metallicity and discussed its dependence on stellar mass and SFR. We find that the overall relation between metallicity and stellar mass of our DGIS nearly follows the extrapolation from the higher mass end. Its dispersion does not decrease by invoking the dependence on SFR.</p>

<p>2025-01-09, <strong>Forecast of gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae time delay measurement by Muztage-Ata 1.93m Synergy Telescope</strong>, Guanhua Rui et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05303v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.05303v1</a></p>

<p>Strong lensing time delay measurement is a promising method to address the Hubble tension, offering a completely independent approach compared to both the cosmic microwave background analysis and the local distance ladder. As a third-party examination of the Hubble tension, this method provides a unique perspective. Strongly lensed quasar (glQSO) systems have demonstrated significant potential in tackling this issue, achieving an impressive (2\%) accuracy level. However, advancing to (1\%) or sub-percent accuracy is challenging due to several intrinsic limitations of glQSOs. Fortunately, strongly lensed supernovae (glSNe) offer a more robust solution, thanks to their characteristic light curve, significant brightness variations, and additional advantages. The Muztagh-Ata 1.93m Synergy Telescope (MOST) is an exceptional instrument for monitoring strong lensing time delays. In this study, we simulate the follow-up multi-band light curve monitoring for glSNe Ia systems, which are expected to be firstly discovered by the Chinese Survey Space Telescope (CSST). Our results show that with (300s \times 9) exposures in each epoch, MOST can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of approximately 50 for the brightest images of glSNe Ia, while even the faintest images maintain an SNR of at least 7. Using a standard SNe Ia light curve template for fitting, we measured the time delays. With a 2-day cadence, MOST achieves a time delay error of only a few hours, with the bias typically remaining below one hour. This study highlights the capability of MOST to significantly advance the precision of time delay measurements, offering a promising path toward resolving the Hubble tension.</p>

<p>2025-01-09, <strong>A possible formation scenario of the Gaia ID 3425577610762832384: inner binary merger inside a triple common envelope</strong>, Zhuowen Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05139v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.05139v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, an identified non-interacting black hole (BH) binary, Gaia ID 3425577610762832384 (hereafter G3425), contains a BH ($\sim$3.6 M$_{\odot}$) falling within the mass gap and has a nearly circular orbit, challenging the classical binary evolution and supernova theory. Here, we propose that G3425 originates from a triple through a triple common envelope (TCE) evolution. The G3425 progenitor originally may consist of three stars with masses of 1.49 M$_{\odot}$, 1.05 M$_{\odot}$, and 21.81 M$_{\odot}$, and inner and outer orbital periods of 4.22 days and 1961.78 days, respectively. As evolution proceeds, the tertiary fills its Roche lobe, leading to a TCE. We find that the orbital energy generated by the inspiral of the inner binary serves as an additional energy imparted for ejecting the common envelope (CE), accounting for $\sim$97\% of the binding energy in our calculations. This means that the outer orbit needs to expend only a small amount of the orbital energy to successfully eject CE. The outcome of the TCE is a binary consisting of a 2.54 M$_\odot$ merger produced by the inner binary merger and a 7.67 M$_\odot$ helium star whose CE successfully ejected, with an orbital period of 547.53 days. The resulting post-TCE binary (PTB) has an orbital period that is 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than the orbital period of a successfully ejected classical binary CE. In subsequent simulations, we find that the successfully ejected helium star has a 44.2\% probability of forming a BH. In the case of a non-complete fallback forming a BH, with an ejected mass of 2.6 M$_{\odot}$ and a relatively low natal kick ($11^{+16}_{-5}$ ${\rm km/s}$ to $49^{+39}_{-39}$ ${\rm km/s}$), this PTB can form G3425 in the Milky Way.</p>
