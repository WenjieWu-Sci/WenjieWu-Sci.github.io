<p>2024-06-18, <strong>Dark Photon Dark Matter Radio Signal from the Milky Way Electron Density</strong>, Ariel Arza et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12797v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.12797v1</a></p>

<p>We consider Thomson-like processes between dark matter dark photons and free electrons in the Milky Way. The result is a radio signal background that can be detectable with current or future radio telescope arrays. In particular, we computed sensitivity prospects for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope and for the future Square Kilometer Array (SKA), concluding that unconstrained parameter space in a wide range of dark photon masses can be probed.</p>

<p>2024-06-18, <strong>Viscous Unified Dark Matter Models Under Scrutiny: Uncovering Inconsistencies from Dynamical System Analysis</strong>, Guillermo Palma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12724v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.12724v1</a></p>

<p>Viscous unified dark matter models aim to describe the dark sector of the Universe, as the dark matter fluid itself gives rise to an accelerated expansion due to a negative bulk viscous pressure. However, in most studies, radiation is often disregarded as a minor factor in dynamical system analyses, overlooking whether radiation domination is achievable. In this paper, we rigorously examine this critical aspect for common parameterizations of bulk viscosity, denoted as $\xi$, within two general classes of viscous unified models. Our findings reveal significant inconsistencies in models where $\xi \propto H^{1-2s} \rho_{m}^{s}$ with $s\leq 0$, and surprisingly, in models where $\xi \propto \rho_{m}^{s}$ with exponents $s&lt;0$, as they both fail to produce a radiation-dominated era. Moreover, the exponent $s$ must lye within the interval $0 \leq s &lt; 1/2$ for the latter model to correctly describes the cosmological evolution. These results underscore the need of including these constraints as a prior in statistical analyses of observational data, with implications for current statistical inferences for the second model, where both prior and best-fit values of $s$ often fall outside the acceptable range.</p>

<p>2024-06-18, <strong>Populating secluded dark sector with ultra-relativistic bubbles</strong>, Aleksandr Azatov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12554v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.12554v1</a></p>

<p>We study Dark Matter production during first order phase transitions from bubble-plasma collisions. We focus on scenarios where the Dark Matter sector is secluded and its interaction with the visible sector (including the Standard Model) originates from dimension-five and dimension-six operators. We find that such DM is generally heavy and has a large initial velocity, leading to the possibility of DM being warm today. We differentiate between the cases of weakly and strongly coupled dark sectors, where, in the latter case, we focus on glueball DM, which turns out to have very distinct phenomenological properties. We also systematically compute the Freeze-In production of the dark sector and compare it with the bubble-plasma DM abundances.</p>

<p>2024-06-18, <strong>Magnetic field and kinetic helicity evolution in simulations of interacting disk galaxies</strong>, Simon Selg et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12532v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.12532v1</a></p>

<p>We carry out a parameter study of interacting disk galaxies with impact parameters ranging from central collisions to weakly interacting scenarios. The orientations of the disks are also varied. In particular, we investigate how magnetic field amplification depends on the these parameters. We use magnetohydrodynamics for gas disks in combination with live dark matter halos in adaptive mesh refinement simulations. The disks are initialized using a setup for isolated disks in hydrostatic equilibrium. Small-scale filtering of the velocity and magnetic field allows us to estimate the turbulent electromotive force (EMF) and kinetic helicity. Time series of the average magnetic field in central and outer disk regions show pronounced peaks during close encounters and mergers. This agrees with observed magnetic fields at different interaction stages. The central field strength exceeds 10 microgauss (corresponding to an amplification factor of 2 to 3) for small impact parameters. As the disks are increasingly disrupted and turbulence is produced by tidal forces, the small-scale EMF reaches a significant fraction of the total EMF. The small-scale kinetic helicity is initially antisymmetric across the disk plane. Albeit its evolution is sensitive to both the impact parameter and inclinations of the rotation axes with respect to the relative motion of the disks, antisymmetry is generally broken through interactions and the merger remnant has lost most of the initial helicity. The EMF and the magnetic field also decay rapidly after coalescence. The strong amplification during close encounters of the interacting galaxies are mostly driven by helical flows and a mean-field dynamo. The small-scale dynamo contributes significantly in post-interaction phases. However, the amplification of the magnetic field cannot be sustained.</p>

<p>2024-06-18, <strong>Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves in the $U(1)_{B-L}$ Extended Inert Doublet Model: A First-Order Phase Transition Perspective</strong>, Indra Kumar Banerjee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12518v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.12518v1</a></p>

<p>We conduct an analysis of a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extended inert doublet model and obtained the parameter space allowing strong first order phase transitions. We show that a large part of the parameter space can cause double first-order phase transitions. Whereas both of these phase transitions can generate a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background, one of them can create primordial black holes with appreciable abundance. The primordial black holes generated at the high scale transition can account for the dark matter maintaining the correct relic abundance. We also show specific benchmark cases and their consequences from the aspect of primordial black holes and gravitational waves.</p>

<p>2024-06-18, <strong>Spin-independent interactions of Dirac Fermionic Dark Matter in the composite Higgs models</strong>, M. G. Belyakova et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12483v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.12483v1</a></p>

<p>According to recent measurements, dark matter magnetic dipole moment is strongly constrained. In the composite Higgs models the magnetic dipole moment of the Dirac dark matter fermion and its mass can be suppressed by the approximate U(1) symmetry. We consider E_6 inspired composite Higgs model (E_6CHM) with U(1) symmetry violating operators, which give rise to dark matter’s mass and coupling constant to Higgs boson. The dependence of the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section on the E_6CHM parameters is explored. We argue that there are regions of the parameter space which are still safe from all current constraints and may lead to spectacular LHC signatures.</p>

<p>2024-06-18, <strong>Projected gravitational wave constraints on primordial black hole abundance for extended mass distributions</strong>, Gabriel Luis Dizon et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12281v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.12281v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the projected minimum constraints set by next-generation gravitational wave detectors Einstein Telescope and LISA on the abundance of primordial black holes relative to dark matter for extended primordial black hole mass distributions. We consider broad power law distributions for a range of negative and positive exponents $\gamma$ and use the IMRPhenomXAS waveforms to simulate binary sources up to mass ratios $q = 1000$ and redshifts $z=300$. Our results show that power law mass distributions loosen the $f_\mathrm{PBH}$ constraint for increasing power law exponents, suggesting that extended distributions do not help in evading existing constraints. Interestingly, very negative values of $\gamma$ yield constraints close to ones derived from a monochromatic distribution.</p>

<p>2024-06-18, <strong>The Impact of Stellar Radiative Feedback on Formation of Young Massive Clusters via Fast HI Gas Collisions</strong>, Ryunosuke Maeda et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12682v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.12682v1</a></p>

<p>Young massive clusters (YMCs) are dense aggregates of young stars and are often speculated as potential precursors to globular clusters. However, the formation mechanism of massive and compact gas clumps that precede YMCs remains unknown. In this paper, we study the formation of such massive clumps via fast HI gas collisions (~100 km/s) as suggested by recent observations and their subsequent evolution into YMCs by using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations involving self-gravity and detailed thermal/chemical processes. In particular, the impact of ionization feedback from stellar radiation is included in an approximate fashion where the temperature within the HII regions is elevated to 10,000 K, while supernova feedback is not included. We examine whether the resulting massive clumps can survive this ionization feedback and evolve into YMCs. Our simulations reveal the emergence of gas clumps that do not only possess substantial mass (~10^5 M_sun) but also sufficient compactness (~5 pc). Notably, these clumps exhibit significantly higher escape velocities compared to the sound speed of the HII region, indicating effective gravitational retention of gas against feedback-induced evaporation. Consequently, these conditions foster efficient star formation within the massive gas clumps, ultimately leading to their evolution into YMCs. We also perform simulations involving lower-velocity gas collisions, approximately 15 km/s, typical shock velocities induced by galactic superbubbles.</p>

<p>2024-06-18, <strong>Merger Precursor: Year-long Transients Preceding Mergers of Low-mass Stripped Stars with Compact Objects</strong>, Daichi Tsuna et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12472v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.12472v1</a></p>

<p>Binary mass transfer can occur at high rates due to rapid expansion of the donor’s envelope. In the case where mass transfer is unstable, the binary can rapidly shrink its orbit and lead to a merger. In this work we consider the appearance of the system preceding merger, specifically for the case of a low-mass ($\approx 2.5$-$3~M_\odot$) helium star with a neutron star (NS) companion. Modeling the mass transfer history as well as the wind launched by super-Eddington accretion onto the NS, we find that such systems can power slowly rising transients with timescales as long as years, and luminosities of $\sim 10^{40}$-$10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ from optical to UV. The final explosion following the merger (or core-collapse of the helium star in some cases) leads to an interaction-powered transient with properties resembling Type Ibn supernovae (SNe), possibly with a bright early peak powered by shock cooling emission for merger-powered explosions. We apply our model to the Type Ibn SN 2023fyq, that displayed a long-term precursor activity from years before the terminal explosion.</p>
