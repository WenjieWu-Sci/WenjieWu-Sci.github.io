<p>2023-07-20, <strong>Discovery Forecasts of the Diffuse Ultra-High-Energy Neutrino Flux with IceCube-Gen2</strong>, Victor B. Valera et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11055v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.11055v1</a></p>

<p>The discovery of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos has the potential to offer unique insight into fundamental questions. To capitalize on the upcoming opportunity provided by new UHE neutrino telescopes, we provide state-of-the-art forecasts of the discovery of a diffuse flux of UHE neutrinos over the next 10-20 years, focusing on neutrino radio-detection in the planned IceCube-Gen2 detector. We use state-of-the-art flux predictions and detector modeling. We find that, even under conservative analysis choices, most benchmark UHE neutrino flux models from the literature may be discovered within 10 years of detector exposure, with many discoverable sooner, and may be distinguished from each other. Our results demonstrate the transformative potential of next-generation UHE neutrino telescopes.</p>

<p>2023-07-20, <strong>Comprehensive Measurement Forecasts of the EeV Neutrino-Nucleon Cross Section with Cosmic Neutrinos at IceCube-Gen2</strong>, Victor B. Valera et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11050v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.11050v1</a></p>

<p>The investigation of neutrino interactions with matter serves as a valuable tool for understanding the fundamental structure of nucleons and potentially uncovering novel physics phenomena. To date, the neutrino-nucleon cross section has been examined across a range of energies spanning from a few hundred MeV to PeV. However, the pursuit of ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic neutrinos, surpassing 100 PeV in energy, holds the promise of further advancements. In the next 10-20 years, UHE neutrino telescopes, currently in the planning stage, may ultimately succeed in their detection. This article presents pioneering and comprehensive estimation forecasts for the ultra-high-energy neutrino-nucleon cross section, with a specific focus on the employment of neutrino radio-detection within the IceCube-Gen2 experiment. The study incorporates cutting-edge methodologies in UHE neutrino flux prediction, neutrino propagation within the Earth, radio detection techniques, and the treatment of background data to facilitate accurate cross section measurement projections. Assuming the successful detection of at least a few tens of UHE neutrino-induced events over a 10-year period, IceCube-Gen2 could achieve, for the first time, the measurement of the cross section at center-of-mass energies of approximately $\sqrt{s} \approx 10$–100 TeV. Furthermore, if the number of events exceeds one hundred, the precision of the cross section measurement could be comparable to its corresponding theoretical prediction.</p>

<p>2023-07-20, <strong>Correlating neutrino magnetic moment and scalar triplet dark matter to enlighten XENONnT bounds in a Type-II model</strong>, Shivaramakrishna Singirala et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10898v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.10898v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate neutrino magnetic moment, triplet scalar dark matter in a Type-II radiative seesaw scenario. With three vector-like fermion doublets and two scalar triplets, we provide a loop level setup for the electromagnetic vertex of neutrinos. All the scalar multiplet components constitute the total dark matter abundance of the Universe and also their scattering cross section with detector lie below the experimental upper limit. Using the consistent parameter space in dark matter domain, we obtain light neutrino mass in sub-eV scale and also magnetic moment in the desired range. We further derive the constraints on neutrino transition magnetic moments, consistent with XENONnT limit.</p>

<p>2023-07-20, <strong>Bardeen spacetime as a quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole: Quasinormal modes and Hawking radiation</strong>, R. A. Konoplya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10801v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.10801v1</a></p>

<p>The Bardeen black hole holds historical significance as the first model of a regular black hole. Recently, there have been proposed interpretations of the Bardeen spacetime as quantum corrections to the Schwarzschild solution. Our study focuses on investigating the quasinormal modes and Hawking radiation of the Bardeen black hole. We have observed that previous studies on the quasinormal modes for the Bardeen black hole suffer from inaccuracies that cannot be neglected. Therefore, we propose accurate calculations of the quasinormal modes for scalar, electromagnetic, and neutrino fields in the Bardeen spacetime. Additionally, we have computed the grey-body factors and analyzed the emission rates of Hawking radiation. Even when the quantum correction is small and the fundamental mode only slightly differs from its Schwarzschild value, the first several overtones deviate at an increasingly stronger rate. This deviation leads to the appearance of overtones with very small real oscillation frequencies. This outburst of overtones is closely linked to the fact that the quantum-corrected black hole differs from its classical limit primarily near the event horizon. Moreover, the intensity of the Hawking radiation is significantly suppressed (up to three orders of magnitude) by the quantum correction.</p>

<p>2023-07-20, <strong>Particle discrimination in a NaI crystal using the COSINUS remote TES design</strong>, COSINUS Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11066v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.11066v1</a></p>

<p>The COSINUS direct dark matter experiment situated at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy is set to investigate the nature of the annually modulating signal detected by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment. COSINUS has already demonstrated that sodium iodide crystals can be operated at mK temperature as cryogenic scintillating calorimeters using transition edge sensors, despite the complication of handling a hygroscopic and low melting point material. With results from a new COSINUS prototype, we show that particle discrimination on an event-by-event basis in NaI is feasible using the dual-channel readout of both phonons and scintillation light. The detector was mounted in the novel remoTES design and operated in an above-ground facility for 9.06 g$\cdot$d of exposure. With a 3.7 g NaI crystal, e$^-$/$\gamma$ events could be clearly distinguished from nuclear recoils down to the nuclear recoil energy threshold of 15 keV.</p>

<p>2023-07-20, <strong>Astrophysical Constraints on Decaying Dark Gravitons</strong>, Jamie A. P. Law-Smith et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11048v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.11048v1</a></p>

<p>In the dark dimension scenario, which predicts an extra dimension of micron scale, dark gravitons (KK modes) are a natural dark matter candidate. In this paper, we study observable features of this model. In particular, their decay to standard matter fields can distort the CMB and impact other astrophysical signals. Using this we place bounds on the parameters of this model. In particular we find that the natural range of parameters in this scenario is consistent with these constraints and leads to the prediction that the mean mass of the dark matter today is less than a few hundred keV and the size of the extra dimension is greater than $\sim 10 \;\mu\mathrm{m}$.</p>

<p>2023-07-20, <strong>Lepton flavor violating dark photon</strong>, Alexey S. Zhevlakov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10771v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.10771v1</a></p>

<p>We study possible impact of dark photons on lepton flavor phenomenology. We derive the constraints on non-diagonal dark photon couplings with leptons by analyzing corresponding contributions to lepton anomalous magnetic moments, rare lepton decays and the prospects of fixed-target experiments aiming for search for light dark matter based on missing energy/momentum techniques.</p>

<p>2023-07-20, <strong>A Parametric Study of the SASI Comparing General Relativistic and Non-Relativistic Treatments</strong>, Samuel J. Dunham et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10904v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.10904v1</a></p>

<p>We present numerical results from a parameter study of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI), investigating the impact of general relativity (GR) on the dynamics. Using GR hydrodynamics and gravity, and non-relativistic (NR) hydrodynamics and gravity, in an idealized model setting, we vary the initial radius of the shock and, by varying its mass and radius in concert, the proto-neutron star (PNS) compactness. We investigate two regimes expected in a post-bounce core-collapse supernova (CCSN): one meant to resemble a relatively low-compactness configuration and one meant to resemble a relatively high-compactness configuration. We find that GR leads to a longer SASI oscillation period, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as large as 1.29 for the high-compactness suite. We also find that GR leads to a slower SASI growth rate, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as low as 0.47 for the high-compactness suite. We discuss implications of our results for CCSN simulations.</p>

<p>2023-07-20, <strong>$Λ_{\rm s}$CDM model: A promising scenario for alleviation of cosmological tensions</strong>, Ozgur Akarsu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10899v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.10899v1</a></p>

<p>We present a comprehensive analysis of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, which explores the recent conjecture suggesting a rapid transition of the Universe from anti-de Sitter vacua to de Sitter vacua (viz., the cosmological constant switches sign from negative to positive) at redshift ${z_\dagger\sim 2}$, inspired by the graduated dark energy (gDE) model. Our analysis shows that, predicting $z_\dagger\approx1.7$, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM simultaneously addresses the major cosmological tensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, viz., the Hubble constant $H_0$, the Type Ia Supernovae absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$, and the growth parameter $S_8$ tensions, along with other less significant tensions such as the BAO Lyman-$\alpha$ discrepancy.</p>

<p>2023-07-20, <strong>The Post-AGB Star IRAS 07253-2001: Pulsations, Long-Term Brightness Variability and Spectral Peculiarities</strong>, N. P. Ikonnikova et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10796v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.10796v1</a></p>

<p>The observations and comprehensive study of intermediate initial mass stars at the late stages of evolution, and after the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) in particular, are of crucial importance to identify the common properties for the stars of given group and to reveal binaries among them. This work aims to investigate photometric and spectral peculiarities of a poorly studied post-AGB candidate and infrared source IRAS 07253-2001. We present the new multicolour $UBVR_{C}I_{C}YJHK$ photometry obtained with the telescopes of the Caucasian mountain observatory and analyse it together with the data acquired by the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae. We report on the detection of multiperiod brightness variability caused by pulsations. A beating of close periods, the main one of 73 days and additional ones of 68 and 70 days, leads to amplitude variations. We have also detected a long-term sine trend in brightness with a period of nearly 1800 days. We suppose it to be orbital and IRAS 07253-2001 to be binary. Based on new low-resolution spectroscopic data obtained with the 2.5-m telescope of the Caucasian mountain observatory in 2020 and 2023 in the $\lambda$3500-7500 wavelength range we have identified spectral lines and compiled a spectral atlas. We have found the [N II], [Ni II] and [S II] forbidden emission lines in the spectrum and discuss their origin. The H$\alpha$ line has a variable double-peaked emission component. We have derived preliminary estimates of the star’s parameters and detected a variation of radial velocity with a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 30 km s$^{-1}$.</p>

<p>2023-07-20, <strong>On the nature of slowly rising interaction-powered supernovae</strong>, Takashi J. Moriya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10553v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2307.10553v1</a></p>

<p>Some interaction-powered supernovae have long rise times of more than 100 days. We show that such long rise times are naturally expected if circumstellar matters (CSM) have a flat density structure (s &lt;~ 1.5, where rho_CSM ~ r^{-s}). In such cases, bolometric luminosities from the CSM interaction keep increasing as long as the CSM interacts with the outer layers of the SN ejecta. Thus, the rise time is determined by the dynamical timescale in which the reverse shock propagates the outer layers of the SN ejecta, not by the timescales in which photons diffuse in the CSM as often considered. Interaction-powered supernovae with very long rise times can be an important probe of extensive non-steady mass loss in massive stars.</p>
