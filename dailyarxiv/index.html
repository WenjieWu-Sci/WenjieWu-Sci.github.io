<p>2024-12-16, <strong>Predictions for dimuon production in high-energy neutrino-proton collisions using the color dipole model</strong>, Caetano Ternes et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12076v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.12076v1</a></p>

<p>Interactions of high-energy neutrinos with matter can be studied through the angular separation observed in dimuon production, an observable particularly sensitive to the transverse momentum dynamics of partons. In this work, we develop a Monte Carlo event generator based on the color dipole model, interfaced with Pythia8 for parton showering and hadronization simulations, to predict dimuon production cross sections in neutrino-proton collisions at energies relevant to IceCube and future detectors. The color dipole formalism generates larger transverse momentum compared to standard Pythia predictions, enhancing the yield of angularly separated high-energy muons.</p>

<p>2024-12-16, <strong>Searching for neutrino self-interactions at future muon colliders</strong>, Hongkai Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11910v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.11910v1</a></p>

<p>Multi-TeV muon colliders offer a powerful means of accessing new physics coupled to muons while generating clean and intense high-energy neutrino beams via muon decays. We study a fixed-target experiment leveraging the neutrino beams and a forward detector pointing at the interaction point of the muon collider. The sensitivity to neutrino self-interactions is analyzed as a feasibility study, focusing on the leptonic scalar $\phi$ exclusively coupled to the Standard Model neutrinos. Our work shows that projections from both the main and forward detectors can enhance the existing limits by two orders of magnitude, surpassing other future experiments.</p>

<p>2024-12-16, <strong>Quantum Decoherence at ESSnuSB Experiment</strong>, ESSnuSB et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11791v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.11791v1</a></p>

<p>In this proceedings we study the sensitivity of the ESSnuSB experiment to probe quantum decoherence. ESSnuSB is a future long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment which aims to measure $\delta_{\rm CP}$ by probing the second oscillation maximum. Using the open quantum system formalism for decoherence, we have shown that the sensitivity of ESSnuSB to constrain the decoherence parameters is better than MINOS but comparable to DUNE. We have also shown that the CP measurement capability of ESSnuSB is robust in presence of decoherence.</p>

<p>2024-12-16, <strong>Superradiant Neutrino Lasers from Radioactive Condensates</strong>, B. J. P Jones et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11765v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.11765v1</a></p>

<p>Superradiance emerges from collective spontaneous emission in optically pumped gases, and is characterized by photon emission enhancements of up to $\frac{1}{4}N^{2}$ in an $N$ atom system. The gain mechanism derives from correlations developed within the decay medium rather than from stimulated emission as in lasing, so analog of this process should be possible for fermionic final states. We introduce here the concept of superradiant neutrino emission from a radioactive Bose Einstein condensate, which can form the basis for a superradiant neutrino laser. A plausible experimental realization based on a condensate of electron-capture isotope $^{83}$Rb could exhibit effective radioactive decay rates accelerated from 82 days to minutes in viably sized rubidium condensates of $10^{6}$ atoms.</p>

<p>2024-12-16, <strong>Cross-section measurements for the production of a $W$-boson in association with high-transverse-momentum jets in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$= 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector</strong>, ATLAS Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11644v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.11644v1</a></p>

<p>A set of measurements for the production of a $W$-boson in association with high-transverse-momentum jets is presented using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The measurements are performed in final states in which the $W$-boson decays into an electron or muon plus a neutrino and is produced in association with jets with $p_{\text{T}}&gt;30$ GeV, where the leading jet has $p_{\text{T}}&gt;500$ GeV. The angular separation between the lepton and the closest jet with $p_{\text{T}}&gt;100$ GeV is measured and used to define a collinear phase space, wherein measurements of kinematic properties of the $W$-boson and the associated jet are performed. The collinear phase space is populated by dijet events radiating a $W$-boson and events with a $W$-boson produced in association with several jets and it serves as an excellent data sample to probe higher-order theoretical predictions. Measured differential distributions are compared with predictions from state-of-the-art next-to-leading order multi-leg merged Monte Carlo event generators and a fixed-order calculation of the $W$+1-jet process computed at next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant.</p>

<p>2024-12-16, <strong>DarkNESS: developing a skipper-CCD instrument to search for Dark Matter from Low Earth Orbit</strong>, Phoenix Alpine et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12084v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.12084v1</a></p>

<p>The DarkNESS (Dark Matter Nano-satellite Equipped with Skipper Sensors) mission aims to deploy a skipper-CCD CubeSat Observatory to search for dark matter (DM) from Low Earth Orbit. This mission will employ novel skipper-CCDs to investigate O(keV) X-rays from decaying DM, as well as electron recoils from strongly-interacting sub-GeV DM. The DarkNESS mission will be the first space deployment of skipper-CCDs, and the DarkNESS team is developing a skipper-CCD instrument that is compatible with the CubeSat platform. DarkNESS has recently progressed from laboratory validation to a Critical Design Review (CDR) phase, with a launch opportunity anticipated in late 2025. The implementation of the DarkNESS skipper-CCD payload on the CubeSat platform will pave the way for future demonstrators of space-based imagers for X-ray and single-electron counting applications.</p>

<p>2024-12-16, <strong>Fuzzy Axions and Associated Relics</strong>, Elijah Sheridan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12012v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.12012v1</a></p>

<p>We study fuzzy axion dark matter in type IIB string theory, for axions descending from the Ramond-Ramond four-form in compactifications on orientifolds of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. Such models can be tested by cosmological measurements if a significant relic abundance of fuzzy dark matter arises, which we argue is most common in models with small numbers of axions. We construct a topologically exhaustive ensemble of more than 350,000 Calabi-Yau compactifications yielding up to seven axions, and in this setting we perform a systematic analysis of misalignment production of fuzzy dark matter. In typical regions of moduli space, the fuzzy axion, the QCD axion, and other axions have comparable decay constants of $f_a \approx 10^{16}$ GeV. We find that overproduction of heavier axions is problematic, except at special loci in moduli space where decay constant hierarchies can occur: without a contrived reheating epoch, it is necessary to fine-tune initial displacements. The resulting dark matter is typically a mix of fuzzy axions and heavier axions, including the QCD axion. Dark photons are typically present as a consequence of the orientifold projection. We examine the signatures of these models by simulating halos with multiple fuzzy axions, and by computing new cosmological constraints on ultralight axions and dark radiation. We also give evidence that cosmic birefringence is possible in this setting. Our findings determine the phenomenological correlates of fuzzy axion dark matter in a corner of the landscape.</p>

<p>2024-12-16, <strong>The cosmic history of Primordial Black Hole accretion and its uncertainties</strong>, Pratibha Jangra et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11921v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.11921v1</a></p>

<p>Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) have not been experimentally detected so far, but their existence would provide important insights about the early Universe and serve as one of the possible candidates of dark matter (DM). In this work, we explore the accretion of radiation and matter by PBHs, with relevance for the growth of PBH seeds to form early Supermassive Black Holes; the emission from accreting PBHs; and constraints from gravitational wave observations, among others. We study the growth of PBH masses in the early Universe due to the accretion of radiation, highlighting uncertainties which arise from estimates of the PBH formation time. For baryonic accretion, we review the traditional Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) and its refined version known as the Park-Ricotti (PR) model, which also includes radiative feedback. We find that in the BHL model, PBHs heavier than $\sim 100 \,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can grow in mass by several orders of magnitude by $z \lesssim 10$, though only when surrounded by DM halos and only when the accretion efficiency is large. By contrast, the inclusion of radiation feedback in the PR model can drastically suppress the baryonic accretion rate of PBHs, leading to a negligible change in PBH mass over cosmic time. Furthermore our calculations show that the accretion rate depends sensitively on the modelling of various parameters such as the speed of sound in the baryonic gas and the velocity of PBHs. These findings highlight the uncertainties associated with accretion onto PBHs, and we find that a large increase in the PBH mass due to accretion is by no means guaranteed.</p>

<p>2024-12-16, <strong>Data analysis of the NISP instrument for the Euclid mission: from the first validation tests on ground up to the verification phase after launch</strong>, Louis Gabarra et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11613v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.11613v1</a></p>

<p>The Euclid telescope, launched from Cape Canaveral on July 1st, 2023, is dedicated to studying dark matter and dark energy from its orbit at the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point L2. It is equipped with two instruments: the visual imager (VIS) and the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP). The Euclid Wide Survey (Scaramella et al. 2022) will cover approximately 14500 deg2 of the extragalactic sky, and will be complemented by the Euclid Deep Survey that will cover about 40 deg2 and achieve two magnitudes fainter depth. Several ground-test campaigns were performed to assess NISP instrument basic functionalities and performances, some highlights will be reviewed in this thesis. The analysis comprises two key aspects: the evaluation of NISP image data acquired during ground-tests and during commissioning, and the verification of instrument performance in spectroscopic mode through the use of pixel-level simulated images. The analysis includes the characterisation of NISP detectors, from instrumental background to point-spread function (PSF) evaluations, confirming that NISP performance is well within the Euclid requirement. We introduce a calibration methodology to estimate the filter wheel assembly position from PSF distortions that have been successfully applied during the commissioning and will continue to be used during the mission for calibration purpose. Additionally, we investigated noise events that occur during image acquisition, with a particular focus on \v{S}snowballs\v{S} and cosmic ray tracks. Finally, we present a spectroscopic pixel-level simulation campaign of the NISP instrument, where spectral energy distributions were generated and processed by the Euclid spectroscopic channel simulator.</p>

<p>2024-12-16, <strong>Observation of a spectral hardening in cosmic ray boron spectrum with the DAMPE space mission</strong>, DAMPE Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11460v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.11460v1</a></p>

<p>Secondary cosmic ray fluxes are important probes of the propagation and interaction of high-energy particles in the Galaxy. Recent measurements of primary and secondary cosmic ray nuclei have revealed unexpected spectral features that demand a deeper understanding. In this work we report the direct measurement of the cosmic ray boron spectrum from 10 TeV/n to 8 TeV/n with eight years of data collected by the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) mission. The measured spectrum shows an evident hardening at $182\pm24$ GeV/n with a spectral power index of $\gamma_1 = 3.02 \pm 0.01$ before the break and an index change of $\Delta \gamma = 0.31 \pm 0.05$ after the break. A simple power law model is disfavored at a confidence level of 8$\sigma$. Compared with the hardenings measured in the DAMPE proton and helium spectra, the secondary boron spectrum hardens roughly twice as much as these primaries, which is consistent with a propagation related mechanism to interpret the spectral hardenings of cosmic rays observed at hundreds of GeV/n.</p>

<p>2024-12-16, <strong>Evidence for the spin-kick alignment of pulsars from the statistics of their magnetic inclinations</strong>, Anton Biryukov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12017v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.12017v1</a></p>

<p>Isolated neutron stars are thought to receive a natal kick velocity at birth nearly aligned with their spin axis. Direct observational confirmation of this alignment has been limited to a single source in a supernova remnant (PSR J0538+2817) whose three-dimensional velocity has been well-constrained. Pulsar polarisation statistical properties indicate the presence of a spin-kick correlation, but aligned and orthogonal cases remain plausible. However, if the three-dimensional velocities of radiopulsars are indeed predominantly aligned with their spin axes, a systematic difference in the observed transverse velocities of pulsars with small and large magnetic obliquities would be expected. In particular, due to projection effects, weakly oblique rotators should show systematically smaller and less scattered transverse velocities. In contrast, transverse velocities of pulsars with large obliquities should be close to their actual three-dimensional velocities. This study analyzed samples of 13 weakly and 25 strongly oblique pulsars with known distances and proper motions. We find their peculiar velocities being distributed differently with the statistical confidence of 0.007 and 0.016 according to Anderson-Darling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, respectively. We performed a detailed population synthesis of the isolated pulsars, considering the evolution of their viewing geometry in both isotropic and spin-aligned kick scenarios. The observed split in the transverse velocity distributions and its amplitude are consistent with the spin-aligned kick model but not the isotropic case. At the same time, an orthogonal kick predicts a similar effect but of the opposite sign. This provides robust support for pulsar spin-kick alignment based on their statistics and independent of their polarization properties.</p>

<p>2024-12-16, <strong>Modelling chemical clocks – Theoretical evidences of the space and time evolution of [s/alpha] in the Galactic disc with Gaia-ESO survey</strong>, Marta Molero et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11844v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.11844v1</a></p>

<p>Chemical clocks based on [s-process elements/alpha-elements] ratios are widely used to estimate ages of Galactic stellar populations. However, the [s/alpha] vs. age relations are not universal, varying with metallicity, location in the Galactic disc, and specific s-process elements. Current Galactic chemical evolution models struggle to reproduce the observed [s/alpha] increase at young ages. We provide chemical evolution models for the Milky Way disc to identify the conditions required to reproduce the observed [s/H], [s/Fe], and [s/alpha] vs. age relations. We adopt a multi-zone chemical evolution model including state-of-the-art nucleosynthesis prescriptions for neutron-capture elements (AGB stars, rotating massive stars, neutron star mergers, magneto-driven supernovae). We explore variations in gas infall, AGB yield dependencies on progenitor stars, and rotational velocity distributions for massive stars. Results are compared with open cluster data from the Gaia-ESO survey. A three-infall scenario for disc formation captures the rise of [s/alpha] with age in the outer regions but fails in the inner ones, especially for second s-process peak elements. Ba production in the last 3 Gyr of chemical evolution would need to increase by half to match observations. S-process contributions from low-mass AGB stars improve predictions but require increases not supported by nucleosynthesis calculations, even with potential i-process contribution. Variations in the metallicity dependence of AGB yields show inconsistent effects across elements. Distributions of massive star rotational velocities fail to improve results due to balanced effects on elements. We confirm that there is no single relationship [s/alpha] vs. age, but that it varies along the MW disc. Current prescriptions for neutron-capture element yields cannot fully capture the complexity of evolution, particularly in the inner disc.</p>

<p>2024-12-16, <strong>Early-time millimeter observations of the nearby Type II SN 2024ggi</strong>, Maokai Hu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11389v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.11389v1</a></p>

<p>The short-lived ionized emission lines in early spectroscopy of the nearby type II supernova SN 2024ggi signify the presence of dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to its progenitor star. We proposed the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations by its Director’s Discretionary Time program to catch the potential synchrotron radiation associated with the ejecta-CSM interaction. Multi-epoch observations were conducted using ALMA band 6 at +8, +13, and +17 days after the discovery. The data show non-detections at the position of SN 2024ggi with a 3sigma upper limit of less than 0.15 mJy, corresponding to a luminosity of approximately 8<em>10^24 erg/s/Hz. In this paper, we leverage the non-detections to place constraints on the properties of CSM surrounding SN 2024ggi. We investigate both the Wind and Eruptive models for the radial distribution of CSM, assuming a constant mass-loss rate in the Wind model and a distance-variant mass-loss rate in the Eruptive model. The derived CSM distribution for the Wind model does not align with the early-time spectral features, while the ALMA observations suggest a mass-loss rate of ~ 5</em>10^-3 Msun/year for the Eruptive model. Conducting multi-epoch millimeter/submillimeter observations shortly after the explosion, with a cadence of a few days, could offer a promising opportunity to capture the observable signature of the Eruptive model.</p>

<p>2024-12-16, <strong>PSR J1631-4722: The Discovery of a Young and Energetic Pulsar in the Supernova Remnant G336.7+0.5</strong>, A. Ahmad et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11345v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.11345v1</a></p>

<p>Detecting a pulsar associated with a supernova remnant (SNR) and/or pulsar wind nebula (PWN) is crucial for unraveling its formation history and pulsar wind dynamics, yet the association with a radio pulsar is observed only in a small fraction of known SNRs and PWNe. In this paper, we report the discovery of a young pulsar J1631$-$4722, associated with the Galactic SNR G336.7$+$0.5 using Murriyang, CSIRO’s Parkes radio telescope. It is also potentially associated with a PWN revealed by the Rapid ASKAP (Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder) Continuum Survey (RACS). This 118 ms pulsar has a high dispersion measure of 873 $\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$ and a rotation measure of $-$1004 $\mathrm{rad\,m^{-2}}$. Because of such a high DM, at frequencies below 2 GHz, the pulse profile is significantly scattered, making it effectively undetectable in previous pulsar surveys at $\sim$1.4 GHz. Follow-up observations yield a period derivative of $\dot{P} = 3.6 \times 10^{-15}$, implying a characteristic age, $\tau_{c} = 33\,$kyr, and spin-down luminosity, $\dot{E} = 1.3\times10^{36}\,$erg$\,s^{-1}$. PSR$\,$J1631$-$4722, with its high spin-down luminosity and potential link to a PWN, stands out as a promising source of the high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission observed in the region.</p>
