<p>2023-10-12, <strong>A Common Origin for the QCD Axion and Sterile Neutrinos from $SU(5)$ Strong Dynamics</strong>, Peter Cox et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08557v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08557v1</a></p>

<p>We identify the QCD axion and right-handed (sterile) neutrinos as bound states of an $SU(5)$ chiral gauge theory with Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry arising as a global symmetry of the strong dynamics. The strong dynamics is assumed to spontaneously break the PQ symmetry, producing a high-quality axion and naturally generating Majorana masses for the right-handed neutrinos at the PQ scale. The composite sterile neutrinos can directly couple to the left-handed (active) neutrinos, realizing a standard see-saw mechanism. Alternatively, the sterile neutrinos can couple to the active neutrinos via a naturally small mass mixing with additional elementary states, leading to light sterile neutrino eigenstates. The $SU(5)$ strong dynamics therefore provides a common origin for a high-quality QCD axion and sterile neutrinos.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>A Plastic Scintillation Muon Veto for Sub-Kelvin Temperatures</strong>, A. Erhart et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08457v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08457v1</a></p>

<p>Rare-event search experiments located on-surface, such as short-baseline reactor neutrino experiments, are often limited by muon-induced background events. Highly efficient muon vetos are essential to reduce the detector background and to reach the sensitivity goals. We demonstrate the feasibility of deploying organic plastic scintillators at sub-Kelvin temperatures. For the NUCLEUS experiment, we developed a cryogenic muon veto equipped with wavelength shifting fibers and a silicon photo multiplier operating inside a dilution refrigerator. The achievable compactness of cryostat-internal integration is a key factor in keeping the muon rate to a minimum while maximizing coverage. The thermal and light output properties of a plastic scintillation detector were examined. We report first data on the thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the polystyrene-based scintillator UPS-923A over a wide range of temperatures extending below one Kelvin. The light output was measured down to 0.8K and observed to increase by a factor of 1.61$\pm$0.05 compared to 300K. The development of an organic plastic scintillation muon veto operating in sub-Kelvin temperature environments opens new perspectives for rare-event searches with cryogenic detectors at sites lacking substantial overburden.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>Recycled Dark Matter</strong>, Thomas C. Gehrman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08526v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08526v1</a></p>

<p>We outline a new production mechanism for dark matter that we dub “recycling”: dark sector particles are kinematically trapped in the false vacuum during a dark phase transition; the false pockets collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs), which ultimately evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) to reproduce the dark sector particles. The requirement that all PBHs evaporate prior to BBN necessitates high scale phase transitions and hence high scale masses for the dark sector particles in the true vacuum. Our mechanism is therefore particularly suited for the production of ultra heavy dark matter (UHDM) with masses above $\sim 10^{12}\,{\rm GeV}$. The correct relic density of UHDM is obtained because of the exponential suppression of the false pocket number density. Recycled UHDM has several novel features: the dark sector today consists of multiple decoupled species that were once in thermal equilibrium and the PBH formation stage has extended mass functions whose shape can be controlled by IR operators coupling the dark and visible sectors.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>Optimum filter-based analysis for the characterization of a high-resolution magnetic microcalorimeter towards the DELight experiment</strong>, Francesco Toschi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08512v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08512v1</a></p>

<p>Ultra-sensitive cryogenic calorimeters have become a favored technology with widespread application where eV-scale energy resolutions are needed. In this article, we characterize the performance of an X-ray magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) using a Fe-55 source. Employing an optimum filter-based amplitude estimation and energy reconstruction, we demonstrate that an unprecedented FWHM resolution of $\Delta E_\mathrm{FWHM} = \left(1.25\pm0.17\mathrm{\scriptsize{(stat)}}^{+0.05}_{-0.07}\mathrm{\scriptsize{(syst)}}\right)\,\text{eV}$ can be achieved. We also derive the best possible resolution and discuss limiting factors affecting the measurement. The analysis pipeline for the MMC data developed in this paper is furthermore an important step for the realization of the proposed superfluid helium-based experiment DELight, which will search for direct interaction of dark matter with masses below 100 MeV/c$^2$.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>95 GeV Diphoton and $b \bar{b}$ Excesses in the General Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model</strong>, Junjie Cao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08436v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08436v1</a></p>

<p>The CMS and ATLAS collaborations recently published their results searching for light Higgs bosons, using the complete Run 2 data of the LHC. Both reported an excess in the diphoton invariant mass distribution at $m_{\gamma \gamma} \simeq 95.4~{\rm GeV}$ with compatible signal strengths. The combined result corresponded to a local significance of $3.1\sigma$. Besides, the mass of the diphoton signal coincided with that of the $b\bar{b}$ excess observed at the LEP. Given the remarkable theoretical advantages of the general Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, we interpret these excesses by the resonant productions of the singlet-dominated CP-even Higgs boson predicted by the theory. Using both analytic formulae and numerical results, we show that the idea can interpret the excesses by broad parameter space without contradicting current experimental restrictions, including those from the 125~{\rm GeV} Higgs data, the dark matter relic abundance and direct detection experiments, and the collider searches for supersymmetry and extra Higgs bosons. Although the explanations are scarcely affected by present Higgs data and the LHC search for supersymmetry, the dark matter physics may leave footprints on them. We also survey the other signals of the light Higgs boson at the LHC.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>Indirect Probe of Electroweak-Interacting Particles at $μ$TRISTAN $μ^+μ^+$ Collider</strong>, Risshin Okabe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08434v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08434v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, a novel collider, called $\mu$TRISTAN, has been proposed, offering the capability to achieve high-energy collisions of anti-muons. This high-energy collider presents an exceptional opportunity for the discovery of electroweak-interacting massive particles (EWIMPs), which are predicted by various new physics models. In a lepton collider like $\mu$TRISTAN, the potential for discovering EWIMPs extends beyond their direct production. Quantum corrections arising from EWIMP loops can significantly enhance our prospects for discovery by precise measurement of Standard Model processes. This study focuses on the indirect detection method within the $\mu$TRISTAN experiment, with a specific emphasis on TeV-scale EWIMP dark matter scenarios that yield the correct thermal relic density. At collision energies for $ \sqrt{s} = O(1-10)$ TeV, these EWIMPs introduce noticeable effects, typically in the range of $O(0.1-1)$\%. Our findings indicate that at $\sqrt{s} = 2\, (10)$ TeV, with an integrated luminosity of 10 ab$^{-1}$, the $\mu$TRISTAN can detect Higgsino at a mass of 1.3 (2.5) TeV and Wino at a mass of 1.9 (3.8) TeV, assuming an optimistic level of systematic uncertainty in the observation of the Standard Model processes.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>From QFT to Boltzmann: Freeze-in in the presence of oscillating condensates</strong>, Wen-Yuan Ai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08272v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08272v1</a></p>

<p>Scalar dark matter (DM), and axions in particular, have an irreducible abundance of particles produced by freeze-in due to portal interactions with the Standard Model plasma in the early Universe. In addition, vacuum misalignment and other mechanisms can lead to the presence of a cold, oscillating condensate. Therefore, generically, the evolution of the DM in both forms, condensate and particles, needs to be studied simultaneously. In non-equilibrium quantum field theory, the condensate and particles are described by one- and two-point functions, respectively. The fundamental coupled equations of motion (EoMs) of these objects are non-local. To simplify the EoMs and bring them into a familiar form for relic abundance calculations, we perform a Markovianization process for a quasi-harmonically oscillating homogeneous condensate, leading to local EoMs for the particle distribution function and the envelope function of condensate oscillation. This reduces the dynamics to a pair of coupled Boltzmann equations, and we derive explicitly the form of the collision operators for all particle and condensate interactions.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>Terrestrial Very-Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry: Workshop Summary</strong>, Sven Abend et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08183v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08183v1</a></p>

<p>This document presents a summary of the 2023 Terrestrial Very-Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry Workshop hosted by CERN. The workshop brought together experts from around the world to discuss the exciting developments in large-scale atom interferometer (AI) prototypes and their potential for detecting ultralight dark matter and gravitational waves. The primary objective of the workshop was to lay the groundwork for an international TVLBAI proto-collaboration. This collaboration aims to unite researchers from different institutions to strategize and secure funding for terrestrial large-scale AI projects. The ultimate goal is to create a roadmap detailing the design and technology choices for one or more km-scale detectors, which will be operational in the mid-2030s. The key sections of this report present the physics case and technical challenges, together with a comprehensive overview of the discussions at the workshop together with the main conclusions.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>Time-Variable Diffuse $γ$-ray Foreground</strong>, Thomas Siegert et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08135v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08135v1</a></p>

<p>While the data analysis of $\gamma$-ray telescopes has now become more robust, some signals may be misinterpretations of a time-variable foreground emission from the Solar System, induced by low-energy cosmic-ray interactions with asteroids. Our goal is to provide emission templates for this time-variable diffuse $\gamma$-ray foreground by considering the populations of Main Belt Asteroids, Jovian and Neptunian Trojans, Kuiper Belt Objects, and the Oort Cloud. We model the spatial distribution of all known asteroids by performing 3D-fits to determine their density profiles and calculate their appearances by line-of-sight integrations. Because Earth and the asteroids are moving with respect to each other, we obtain diffuse emission templates varying on timescales of days to decades. We find that the temporal variability can lead to flux enhancements which may mimic emission features unless properly taken into account. This variation is further enhanced by the Solar cycle as the cosmic-ray spectrum is attenuated by the Solar modulation potential, leading to a relative flux increase of the outer asteroids. The cumulative effect of the time-dependent emission is illustrated for the case of the 511 keV OSSE fountain, and for emission features near the Galactic Centre, both being possible misinterpretations of the Solar System albedo. We recommend that $\gamma$-ray data analyses should always take into account the possibility of a time-variable foreground. Due to the ecliptic overlap with the Galactic plane, the Galactic emission is expected to be weaker by 0.1-20%, depending on time (relative planetary motion), energy, and Solar cycle, which has immense consequences for the interpretation of dark matter annihilation cross sections, cosmic-ray spectra and amplitudes, as well as nucleosynthesis yields and related parameters.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>The difficult path to coalescence: massive black hole dynamics in merging low mass dark matter haloes and galaxies</strong>, Christian Partmann et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08079v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08079v1</a></p>

<p>We present a high resolution numerical study of the sinking and merging of massive black holes (MBHs) with masses in the range of $10^3 - 10^7 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ in multiple minor mergers of low mass dark matter halos without and with galaxies ($4\times 10^8 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot \lesssim \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{halo}} \lesssim 2\times 10^{10} \, \mathrm{M}_\odot)$. The Ketju simulation code, a combination of the Gadget tree solver with accurate regularised integration, uses unsoftened forces between the star/dark matter components and the MBHs for an accurate treatment of dynamical friction and scattering of dark matter/stars by MBH binaries or multiples. Post-Newtonian corrections up to order 3.5 for MBH interactions allow for coalescence by gravitational wave emission and gravitational recoil kicks. Low mass MBHs ($\lesssim 10^5 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$) hardly sink to the centre or merge. Sinking MBHs have various complex evolution paths - binaries, triplets, free-floating MBHs, and dynamically or recoil ejected MBHs. Collisional interactions with dark matter alone can drive MBHs to coalescence. The highest mass MBHs of $\gtrsim 10^6 M_\odot$ mostly sink to the centre and trigger the scouring of dark matter and stellar cores. The scouring can transform a centrally baryon dominated system to a dark matter dominated system. Our idealized high-resolution study highlights the difficulty to bring in and keep low mass MBHs in the centres of low mass halos/galaxies - a remaining challenge for merger assisted MBH seed growth mechanisms.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>Analytical estimation of the signal to noise ratio efficiency in axion dark matter searches using a Savitzky-Golay filter</strong>, A. K. Yi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07967v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07967v1</a></p>

<p>The signal to noise ratio efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm SNR}$ in axion dark matter searches has been estimated using large-statistic simulation data reflecting the background information and the expected axion signal power obtained from a real experiment. This usually requires a lot of computing time even with the assistance of powerful computing resources. Employing a Savitzky-Golay filter for background subtraction, in this work, we estimated a fully analytical $\epsilon_{\rm SNR}$ without relying on large-statistic simulation data, but only with an arbitrary axion mass and the relevant signal shape information. Hence, our work can provide $\epsilon_{\rm SNR}$ using minimal computing time and resources prior to the acquisition of experimental data, without the detailed information that has to be obtained from real experiments. Axion haloscope searches have been observing the coincidence that the frequency independent scale factor $\xi$ is approximately consistent with the $\epsilon_{\rm SNR}$. This was confirmed analytically in this work, when the window length of the Savitzky-Golay filter is reasonably wide enough, i.e., at least 5 times the signal window.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>Strengthening interacting agegraphic dark energy DGP constraints with supernovae and multimessenger forecastings</strong>, Maribel Hernández et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08502v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08502v1</a></p>

<p>An explanation of the nature of dark energy has been treated in extra dimensions within the scheme of string theory. One of the most successful models is inspired by the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model, in which the universe is a 4-dimensional brane embedded in a 5-dimensional Minkowski space-time. In this landscape, the study of the evolution of the normal branch has led us to different kinds of dark energy, where the most simple case is the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Moreover, other viable cosmological solutions are related to agegraphic dark energy, which allows a late cosmic acceleration within an interacting mechanism. To explore the viability of these solutions and a possible gravitational leakage, in this paper, we present constraints on such models using recent standard sirens forecasting in addition to local observables such as Supernovae Type Ia. Our results show that the value associated with the species of quantum fields $n$ in these models is strongly restricted for supernovae observations to $n=20$, and for GW standard sirens mock data prefers a value of $n=1$.</p>
