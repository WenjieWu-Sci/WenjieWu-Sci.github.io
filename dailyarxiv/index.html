<p>2023-10-12, <strong>A Common Origin for the QCD Axion and Sterile Neutrinos from $SU(5)$ Strong Dynamics</strong>, Peter Cox et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08557v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08557v1</a></p>

<p>We identify the QCD axion and right-handed (sterile) neutrinos as bound states of an $SU(5)$ chiral gauge theory with Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry arising as a global symmetry of the strong dynamics. The strong dynamics is assumed to spontaneously break the PQ symmetry, producing a high-quality axion and naturally generating Majorana masses for the right-handed neutrinos at the PQ scale. The composite sterile neutrinos can directly couple to the left-handed (active) neutrinos, realizing a standard see-saw mechanism. Alternatively, the sterile neutrinos can couple to the active neutrinos via a naturally small mass mixing with additional elementary states, leading to light sterile neutrino eigenstates. The $SU(5)$ strong dynamics therefore provides a common origin for a high-quality QCD axion and sterile neutrinos.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>A Plastic Scintillation Muon Veto for Sub-Kelvin Temperatures</strong>, A. Erhart et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08457v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08457v1</a></p>

<p>Rare-event search experiments located on-surface, such as short-baseline reactor neutrino experiments, are often limited by muon-induced background events. Highly efficient muon vetos are essential to reduce the detector background and to reach the sensitivity goals. We demonstrate the feasibility of deploying organic plastic scintillators at sub-Kelvin temperatures. For the NUCLEUS experiment, we developed a cryogenic muon veto equipped with wavelength shifting fibers and a silicon photo multiplier operating inside a dilution refrigerator. The achievable compactness of cryostat-internal integration is a key factor in keeping the muon rate to a minimum while maximizing coverage. The thermal and light output properties of a plastic scintillation detector were examined. We report first data on the thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the polystyrene-based scintillator UPS-923A over a wide range of temperatures extending below one Kelvin. The light output was measured down to 0.8K and observed to increase by a factor of 1.61$\pm$0.05 compared to 300K. The development of an organic plastic scintillation muon veto operating in sub-Kelvin temperature environments opens new perspectives for rare-event searches with cryogenic detectors at sites lacking substantial overburden.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Modeling Neutrino-Induced Scale-Dependent Galaxy Clustering for Photometric Galaxy Surveys</strong>, P. Rogozenski et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07933v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07933v1</a></p>

<p>The increasing statistical precision of photometric redshift surveys requires improved accuracy of theoretical predictions for large-scale structure observables to obtain unbiased cosmological constraints. In $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies, massive neutrinos stream freely at small cosmological scales, suppressing the small-scale power spectrum. In massive neutrino cosmologies, galaxy bias modeling needs to accurately relate the scale-dependent growth of the underlying matter field to observed galaxy clustering statistics. In this work, we implement a computationally efficient approximation of the neutrino-induced scale-dependent bias (NISDB). Through simulated likelihood analyses of Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DESY3) and Legacy Survey of Space and Time Year 1 (LSSTY1) synthetic data that contain an appreciable NISDB, we examine the impact of linear galaxy bias and neutrino mass modeling choices on cosmological parameter inference. We find model misspecification of the NISDB approximation and neutrino mass models to decrease the constraining power of photometric galaxy surveys and cause parameter biases in the cosmological interpretation of future surveys. We quantify these biases and devise mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>First steps towards understanding neutrinos</strong>, Francesco Vissani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07834v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07834v1</a></p>

<p>We retrace the first steps towards understanding neutrinos, particles predicted by Pauli in 1930 to avoid a supposed violation of time-translation symmetry. Despite the tendency to reduce the whole story to his intuition and the skill of Reines &amp; Cowan, according to history great strides were made in thirties thanks to precious intellectual tools that combined ideas and mathematics. I refer primarily to the contribution of Fermi, who proposed in 1933 a theory in which matter particles can appear and disappear, prototypical of those at the basis of todayâs particle physics. This theory, despite its limitations, led physicists towards the observation of neutrinos, paved the way for further developments - e.g., it anticipated the characteristic of crossing symmetry - and had an impressive scientific legacy. We reconstruct the chain of arguments in the most accessible terms for a modern reader, emphasising the role of theoretical physics and reflecting on some alternative assessments of Fermiâs contribution. A few technical remarks are collected in the appendix.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Quantum kinetic equations with flavor and particle-antiparticle coherences for neutrinos</strong>, Kimmo Kainulainen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07776v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07776v1</a></p>

<p>We develop a formalism to model neutrino evolution encompassing both flavor and particle-antiparticle mixings and decohering collisions. Our results include a quantum kinetic equation (a set of coupled scalar equations) for the generalized neutrino density matrix, valid for arbitrary neutrino masses and kinematics, and a comprehensive set of Feynman rules to compute collision integrals for coherently evolving states. We expose a novel shell structure describing the phase space of mixing neutrinos and show how the prior information on the system can enter into the theory and modify the neutrino flavor evolution. Potential applications of our results include modelling neutrino distributions in hot and dense environments and studies of neutrino mixing effects in colliders and in the early Universe.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Search for heavy neutral leptons in electron-positron and neutral-pion final states with the MicroBooNE detector</strong>, MicroBooNE collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07660v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07660v1</a></p>

<p>We present the first search for heavy neutral leptons (HNL) decaying into $\nu e^+e^-$ or $\nu\pi^0$ final states in a liquid-argon time projection chamber using data collected with the MicroBooNE detector. The data were recorded synchronously with the NuMI neutrino beam from Fermilabâs Main Injector corresponding to a total exposure of $7.01 \times 10^{20}$ protons on target. We set upper limits at the $90\%$ confidence level on the mixing parameter $\lvert U_{\mu 4}\rvert^2$ in the mass ranges $10\le m_{\rm HNL}\le 150$ MeV for the $\nu e^+e^-$ channel and $150\le m_{\rm HNL}\le 245$ MeV for the $\nu\pi^0$ channel, assuming $\lvert U_{e 4}\rvert^2 = \lvert U_{\tau 4}\rvert^2 = 0$. These limits represent the most stringent constraints in the mass range $35&lt;m_{\rm HNL}&lt;175$ MeV and the first constraints from a direct search for $\nu\pi^0$ decays.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Commissioning, Calibration, and Performance of the Cherenkov Telescope on EUSO-SPB2</strong>, Oscar Fernando Romero Matamala et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07561v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07561v1</a></p>

<p>The detection of astrophysical neutrinos by IceCube in the TeV-PeV energy range motivates the development of instruments for observing these particles at higher energies. Moreover, the detection of very-high-energy (VHE) neutrinos could potentially bring constraints on ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) source models. Tau neutrinos skimming the Earth under a shallow angle can be detected through the decay of a tau resulting in an extensive air shower (EAS) in the atmosphere. The EAS can be detected by capturing some of the optical Cherenkov signal originating from the EAS particles. To assess the feasibility of the Earth-skimming technique from high altitudes, we developed a Cherenkov telescope which was deployed on the Extreme Universe Space Observatory Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) from Wanaka, NZ, on May $13^{th}$. It is a precursor for the Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics. The 1m diameter Cherenkov telescope for EUSO-SPB2 had a focal plane comprised of 512 silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) covering a 6.4 x 12.8 square degree field of view coupled to a 100 MS/s readout based on the GET switch capacitor ring sampler. We discuss the calibration and commissioning of the telescope and its in-flight performance.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Slepton searches in the trilinear RPV SUSY scenarios at the HL-LHC and HE-LHC</strong>, Arghya Choudhury et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07532v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07532v1</a></p>

<p>In this work we have studied a multi-lepton final state arising from sneutrino and left-handed slepton production at the high luminosity and high energy LHC in the context of R-parity violating supersymmetry when only the lepton number violating $\lambda_{121}$ and/or $\lambda_{122}$ couplings are non-zero. We have taken into account both pair production and associated production of the three generations of left-handed sleptons and sneutrinos, which are assumed to be mass degenerate. The lightest supersymmetric particle is assumed to be bino and it decays via the R-parity violating couplings into light leptons and neutrinos. Our final state has a large lepton multiplicity, $N_{l}\geq 4~(l=e,~\mu)$. We perform both cut-based and machine learning based analyses for comparison. We present our results in the bino-slepton/sneutrino mass plane in terms of exclusion and discovery reach at the LHC. Following our analysis, the slepton mass can be discovered upto $\sim$ 1.54 TeV and excluded upto $\sim$ 1.87 TeV at the high luminosity LHC while these ranges go upto $\sim$ 2.46 TeV and $\sim$ 3.06 TeV respectively at the high energy LHC.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>The Impact of Southern-Hemisphere Radio Blazar Observations on Neutrino Astronomy</strong>, F. RÃ¶sch et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07468v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07468v1</a></p>

<p>The origin of high-energy cosmic neutrinos detected by the IceCube observatory is a hotly debated topic in astroparticle physics. There is growing evidence that some of these neutrinos can be associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN) and especially with blazars. Several recent studies have revealed a statistical correlation between radio-bright AGN samples and IceCube neutrino event catalogs. In addition, a growing number of individual high-energy neutrinos have been found to coincide with individual radio-flaring blazars. These observational results strongly call for high-quality, high angular-resolution radio observations of such neutrino-associated blazars to study their parsec-scale jet structures. TANAMI is the only large and long-term VLBI monitoring program focused on the Southern sky. Within TANAMI, we put an emphasis on Southern IceCube neutrino candidate blazars at 2.3 GHz and 8.4 GHz. Here we present first results of the first high-quality, high angular-resolution VLBI observations of nine Southern-Hemisphere blazars that were associated to IceCube neutrino hotspots in the Southern sky. In the near future, the rapidly growing KM3NeT will complement IceCube by being sensitive to high-energy neutrinos mainly from the Southern Hemisphere. This will increase the importance of Southern-Hemisphere radio monitoring programs of neutrino-associated blazars, like TANAMI.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Constraints on a Generalization of Geometric Quantum Mechanics from Neutrino and $B^0$-$\overline{B^0}$ Oscillations</strong>, Nabin Bhatta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07457v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07457v1</a></p>

<p>Nambu Quantum Mechanics, proposed in Phys. Lett. B536, 305 (2002), is a deformation of canonical Quantum Mechanics in which the manifold over which the âphaseâ of an energy eigenstate time evolves is modified. This generalization affects oscillation and interference phenomena through the introduction of two deformation parameters that quantify the extent of deviation from canonical Quantum Mechanics. In this paper, we constrain these parameters utilizing atmospheric neutrino oscillation data, and $B^0$-$\overline{B^0}$ oscillation data from Belle. Surprisingly, the bound from atmospheric neutrinos is stronger than the bound from Belle. Various features of Nambu Quantum Mechanics are also discussed.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Modern topics in relativistic spin dynamics and magnetism</strong>, Andrew Steinmetz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07193v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07193v1</a></p>

<p>Magnetism is a rich subject touching all aspects of physics. My goal with this dissertation is to explore spin and magnetic moments in \emph{relativistic} mechanics from both a quantum and classical perspective. We emphasize the special case of gyromagnetic ratio $g!=!2$ and its relationship to the algebraic spin structure of wave equations. In relativistic quantum mechanics, we investigate generalizations of the Dirac equation for arbitrary magnetic moments for fermions. We analyze the homogeneous magnetic field case and the Coulomb problem for hydrogen-like atoms with emphasis on the role of the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM). We explore alternative approaches which combine mass and the magnetic moment. Classically, we propose a relativistic covariant model of the Stern-Gerlach force via the introduction of a magnetic four-potential. This model modifies the covariant torque equations and unites the Amp`erian and Gilbertian models for magnetic moments.   We further study (transition) magnetic dipoles in Majorana neutrinos specifically analyzing the relationship between flavor mixing and electromagnetic (EM) fields. We demonstrate EM flavor mixing explicitly in the 2-flavor model and develop a dynamical mass basis with an EM rotation matrix. EM induced neutrino mass splitting is compared to neutrino mass hierarchy.   An interesting application of these theoretical developments is to study primordial magnetization in the early universe during the hot dense electron-positron plasma epoch. We propose a model of magnetic thermal matter-antimatter plasmas. We analyze the paramagnetic characteristics of electron-positron plasma when exposed to an external primordial field.   Future research outlooks include: Second order equations for anomalous quantum chromodynamic (QCD) moments, neutrino CP violation in strong EM fields, and fifth-dimension spin dynamics in Kaluza-Klein theory.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Simulating MCP secondary electron avalanche process by Geant4</strong>, Huaxing Peng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07153v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07153v1</a></p>

<p>The curved channel Microchannel Plates(MCP) represent a significant advancement in inhibiting ion-feedback, which is the major cause of after-pulse in output signal of MCPs. Many high sensitive experiments, such as neutrino detection, require as low noise as possible. The conventional straight channel MCP is inevitable to introduce the after-pulses, which are the major source of noise. Normally, couple two straight MCPs in cascade and combine the channels into a âVâ shape can effectively suppress ion-feedback, known as chevron MCPs. However, due to the limitation manufacture technology, the gap always exist. It will worsen the resolution and peak-to-valley ratio. Different with the joint MCPs that is mentioned above, the curved MCPs exhibit superior characteristics. Based on the Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation framework, we investigate how the geometrical parameter of curved channel MCP influence the gain. Consequently, when the MCP thickness and operating voltage are fixed, an optimum pore radius exists to reach maximum gain. Additionally, The simulation of electron tracks in MCP channels reveals that the average acceleration distance before incident inner wall is approximately 20 $\upmu \mathrm{m}$ for a curved MCP with applied voltage 950 V, length-diameter-ratio 80:1, and pore diameter 20 $\upmu \mathrm{m}$</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Probing self-interacting sterile neutrino dark matter with the diffuse supernova neutrino background</strong>, A. Baha Balantekin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07145v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07145v1</a></p>

<p>The neutrinos in the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) travel over cosmological distances and this provides them with an excellent opportunity to interact with dark relics. We show that a cosmologically-significant relic population of keV-mass sterile neutrinos with strong self-interactions could imprint their presence in the DSNB. The signatures of the self-interactions would be âdipsâ in the otherwise smooth DSNB spectrum. Upcoming large-scale neutrino detectors, for example Hyper-Kamiokande, have a good chance of detecting the DSNB and these dips. If no dips are detected, this method serves as an independent constraint on the sterile neutrino self-interaction strength and mixing with active neutrinos. We show that relic sterile neutrino parameters that evade X-ray and structure bounds may nevertheless be testable by future detectors like TRISTAN, but may also produce dips in the DSNB which could be detectable. Such a detection would suggest the existence of a cosmologicaly-significant, strongly self-interacting sterile neutrino background, likely embedded in a richer dark sector.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>Recycled Dark Matter</strong>, Thomas C. Gehrman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08526v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08526v1</a></p>

<p>We outline a new production mechanism for dark matter that we dub ârecyclingâ: dark sector particles are kinematically trapped in the false vacuum during a dark phase transition; the false pockets collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs), which ultimately evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) to reproduce the dark sector particles. The requirement that all PBHs evaporate prior to BBN necessitates high scale phase transitions and hence high scale masses for the dark sector particles in the true vacuum. Our mechanism is therefore particularly suited for the production of ultra heavy dark matter (UHDM) with masses above $\sim 10^{12}\,{\rm GeV}$. The correct relic density of UHDM is obtained because of the exponential suppression of the false pocket number density. Recycled UHDM has several novel features: the dark sector today consists of multiple decoupled species that were once in thermal equilibrium and the PBH formation stage has extended mass functions whose shape can be controlled by IR operators coupling the dark and visible sectors.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>Optimum filter-based analysis for the characterization of a high-resolution magnetic microcalorimeter towards the DELight experiment</strong>, Francesco Toschi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08512v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08512v1</a></p>

<p>Ultra-sensitive cryogenic calorimeters have become a favored technology with widespread application where eV-scale energy resolutions are needed. In this article, we characterize the performance of an X-ray magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) using a Fe-55 source. Employing an optimum filter-based amplitude estimation and energy reconstruction, we demonstrate that an unprecedented FWHM resolution of $\Delta E_\mathrm{FWHM} = \left(1.25\pm0.17\mathrm{\scriptsize{(stat)}}^{+0.05}_{-0.07}\mathrm{\scriptsize{(syst)}}\right)\,\text{eV}$ can be achieved. We also derive the best possible resolution and discuss limiting factors affecting the measurement. The analysis pipeline for the MMC data developed in this paper is furthermore an important step for the realization of the proposed superfluid helium-based experiment DELight, which will search for direct interaction of dark matter with masses below 100 MeV/c$^2$.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>95 GeV Diphoton and $b \bar{b}$ Excesses in the General Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model</strong>, Junjie Cao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08436v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08436v1</a></p>

<p>The CMS and ATLAS collaborations recently published their results searching for light Higgs bosons, using the complete Run 2 data of the LHC. Both reported an excess in the diphoton invariant mass distribution at $m_{\gamma \gamma} \simeq 95.4~{\rm GeV}$ with compatible signal strengths. The combined result corresponded to a local significance of $3.1\sigma$. Besides, the mass of the diphoton signal coincided with that of the $b\bar{b}$ excess observed at the LEP. Given the remarkable theoretical advantages of the general Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, we interpret these excesses by the resonant productions of the singlet-dominated CP-even Higgs boson predicted by the theory. Using both analytic formulae and numerical results, we show that the idea can interpret the excesses by broad parameter space without contradicting current experimental restrictions, including those from the 125~{\rm GeV} Higgs data, the dark matter relic abundance and direct detection experiments, and the collider searches for supersymmetry and extra Higgs bosons. Although the explanations are scarcely affected by present Higgs data and the LHC search for supersymmetry, the dark matter physics may leave footprints on them. We also survey the other signals of the light Higgs boson at the LHC.</p>

<p>Recently, a novel collider, called $\mu$TRISTAN, has been proposed, offering the capability to achieve high-energy collisions of anti-muons. This high-energy collider presents an exceptional opportunity for the discovery of electroweak-interacting massive particles (EWIMPs), which are predicted by various new physics models. In a lepton collider like $\mu$TRISTAN, the potential for discovering EWIMPs extends beyond their direct production. Quantum corrections arising from EWIMP loops can significantly enhance our prospects for discovery by precise measurement of Standard Model processes. This study focuses on the indirect detection method within the $\mu$TRISTAN experiment, with a specific emphasis on TeV-scale EWIMP dark matter scenarios that yield the correct thermal relic density. At collision energies for $ \sqrt{s} = O(1-10)$ TeV, these EWIMPs introduce noticeable effects, typically in the range of $O(0.1-1)$\%. Our findings indicate that at $\sqrt{s} = 2\, (10)$ TeV, with an integrated luminosity of 10 ab$^{-1}$, the $\mu$TRISTAN can detect Higgsino at a mass of 1.3 (2.5) TeV and Wino at a mass of 1.9 (3.8) TeV, assuming an optimistic level of systematic uncertainty in the observation of the Standard Model processes.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>From QFT to Boltzmann: Freeze-in in the presence of oscillating condensates</strong>, Wen-Yuan Ai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08272v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08272v1</a></p>

<p>Scalar dark matter (DM), and axions in particular, have an irreducible abundance of particles produced by freeze-in due to portal interactions with the Standard Model plasma in the early Universe. In addition, vacuum misalignment and other mechanisms can lead to the presence of a cold, oscillating condensate. Therefore, generically, the evolution of the DM in both forms, condensate and particles, needs to be studied simultaneously. In non-equilibrium quantum field theory, the condensate and particles are described by one- and two-point functions, respectively. The fundamental coupled equations of motion (EoMs) of these objects are non-local. To simplify the EoMs and bring them into a familiar form for relic abundance calculations, we perform a Markovianization process for a quasi-harmonically oscillating homogeneous condensate, leading to local EoMs for the particle distribution function and the envelope function of condensate oscillation. This reduces the dynamics to a pair of coupled Boltzmann equations, and we derive explicitly the form of the collision operators for all particle and condensate interactions.</p>

<p>This document presents a summary of the 2023 Terrestrial Very-Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry Workshop hosted by CERN. The workshop brought together experts from around the world to discuss the exciting developments in large-scale atom interferometer (AI) prototypes and their potential for detecting ultralight dark matter and gravitational waves. The primary objective of the workshop was to lay the groundwork for an international TVLBAI proto-collaboration. This collaboration aims to unite researchers from different institutions to strategize and secure funding for terrestrial large-scale AI projects. The ultimate goal is to create a roadmap detailing the design and technology choices for one or more km-scale detectors, which will be operational in the mid-2030s. The key sections of this report present the physics case and technical challenges, together with a comprehensive overview of the discussions at the workshop together with the main conclusions.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>Time-Variable Diffuse $Î³$-ray Foreground</strong>, Thomas Siegert et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08135v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08135v1</a></p>

<p>While the data analysis of $\gamma$-ray telescopes has now become more robust, some signals may be misinterpretations of a time-variable foreground emission from the Solar System, induced by low-energy cosmic-ray interactions with asteroids. Our goal is to provide emission templates for this time-variable diffuse $\gamma$-ray foreground by considering the populations of Main Belt Asteroids, Jovian and Neptunian Trojans, Kuiper Belt Objects, and the Oort Cloud. We model the spatial distribution of all known asteroids by performing 3D-fits to determine their density profiles and calculate their appearances by line-of-sight integrations. Because Earth and the asteroids are moving with respect to each other, we obtain diffuse emission templates varying on timescales of days to decades. We find that the temporal variability can lead to flux enhancements which may mimic emission features unless properly taken into account. This variation is further enhanced by the Solar cycle as the cosmic-ray spectrum is attenuated by the Solar modulation potential, leading to a relative flux increase of the outer asteroids. The cumulative effect of the time-dependent emission is illustrated for the case of the 511 keV OSSE fountain, and for emission features near the Galactic Centre, both being possible misinterpretations of the Solar System albedo. We recommend that $\gamma$-ray data analyses should always take into account the possibility of a time-variable foreground. Due to the ecliptic overlap with the Galactic plane, the Galactic emission is expected to be weaker by 0.1-20%, depending on time (relative planetary motion), energy, and Solar cycle, which has immense consequences for the interpretation of dark matter annihilation cross sections, cosmic-ray spectra and amplitudes, as well as nucleosynthesis yields and related parameters.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>The difficult path to coalescence: massive black hole dynamics in merging low mass dark matter haloes and galaxies</strong>, Christian Partmann et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08079v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.08079v1</a></p>

<p>We present a high resolution numerical study of the sinking and merging of massive black holes (MBHs) with masses in the range of $10^3 - 10^7 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ in multiple minor mergers of low mass dark matter halos without and with galaxies ($4\times 10^8 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot \lesssim \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{halo}} \lesssim 2\times 10^{10} \, \mathrm{M}_\odot)$. The Ketju simulation code, a combination of the Gadget tree solver with accurate regularised integration, uses unsoftened forces between the star/dark matter components and the MBHs for an accurate treatment of dynamical friction and scattering of dark matter/stars by MBH binaries or multiples. Post-Newtonian corrections up to order 3.5 for MBH interactions allow for coalescence by gravitational wave emission and gravitational recoil kicks. Low mass MBHs ($\lesssim 10^5 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$) hardly sink to the centre or merge. Sinking MBHs have various complex evolution paths - binaries, triplets, free-floating MBHs, and dynamically or recoil ejected MBHs. Collisional interactions with dark matter alone can drive MBHs to coalescence. The highest mass MBHs of $\gtrsim 10^6 M_\odot$ mostly sink to the centre and trigger the scouring of dark matter and stellar cores. The scouring can transform a centrally baryon dominated system to a dark matter dominated system. Our idealized high-resolution study highlights the difficulty to bring in and keep low mass MBHs in the centres of low mass halos/galaxies - a remaining challenge for merger assisted MBH seed growth mechanisms.</p>

<p>2023-10-12, <strong>Analytical estimation of the signal to noise ratio efficiency in axion dark matter searches using a Savitzky-Golay filter</strong>, A. K. Yi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07967v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07967v1</a></p>

<p>The signal to noise ratio efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm SNR}$ in axion dark matter searches has been estimated using large-statistic simulation data reflecting the background information and the expected axion signal power obtained from a real experiment. This usually requires a lot of computing time even with the assistance of powerful computing resources. Employing a Savitzky-Golay filter for background subtraction, in this work, we estimated a fully analytical $\epsilon_{\rm SNR}$ without relying on large-statistic simulation data, but only with an arbitrary axion mass and the relevant signal shape information. Hence, our work can provide $\epsilon_{\rm SNR}$ using minimal computing time and resources prior to the acquisition of experimental data, without the detailed information that has to be obtained from real experiments. Axion haloscope searches have been observing the coincidence that the frequency independent scale factor $\xi$ is approximately consistent with the $\epsilon_{\rm SNR}$. This was confirmed analytically in this work, when the window length of the Savitzky-Golay filter is reasonably wide enough, i.e., at least 5 times the signal window.</p>

<p>Low-temperature cryogenics open the door for a range of interesting technologies based on features like superconductivity and superfluidity, low-temperature phase transitions or the low heat capacity of non-metals in the milli-Kelvin range, that may be employed by a variety of applications. Devices based on these technologies are often sensitive to small energy depositions as can be caused by environmental radiation. The Cryogenic Underground TEst facility (CUTE) at SNOLAB is a platform for testing and operating cryogenic devices in a low-radiation background environment. Reaching a base temperature of $\sim$12 mK, the large experimental chamber ($\mathcal{O}$(10) L) can hold a payload of up to $\sim$20 kg and provides a radiogenic background event rate as low as a few events/kg/keV/day in the energy range below about 100 keV, and a negligible muon rate ($\mathcal{O}$(1)/month). It was designed and built in the context of the Super Cryogenic Dark Matter Search experiment (SuperCDMS) that uses cryogenic detectors to search for interactions of dark matter particles with ordinary matter and has been used to test SuperCDMS detectors since its commissioning in 2019. In 2021 was handed over to SNOLAB to become a SNOLAB user facility after the completion of the testing of detectors for SuperCDMS. The facility will be made available for projects that benefit from or require these special conditions, based on proposals assessed</p>

<p>The near equality of the dark matter and baryon energy densities is a remarkable coincidence, especially when one realizes that the baryon mass is exponentially sensitive to UV parameters in the form of dimensional transmutation. We explore a new dynamical mechanism, where in the presence of an arbitrary number density of baryons and dark matter, a scalar adjusts the masses of dark matter and baryons until the two energy densities are comparable. In this manner, the coincidence is explained regardless of the microscopic identity of dark matter and how it was produced. This new scalar causes a variety of experimental effects such as a new force and a (dark) matter density-dependent proton mass.</p>

<p>Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) has been proposed to solve small-scale problems in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In previous work, constraints on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter have been derived assuming that the self-interaction cross-section is independent of velocity. However, a velocity-dependent cross-section is more natural in most theories of SIDM. Using idealized $N$-body simulations, we study merging clusters, with velocity-dependent SIDM. In addition to the usual rare scattering in the isotropic limit, we also simulate these systems with anisotropic, small-angle (frequent) scatterings. We study the qualitative features of the mergers and we find that the effects of velocity-dependent cross-sections are observed when comparing early-time and late-time oscillation amplitude of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). Finally, we also extend the existing upper bounds on the velocity-independent, isotropic self-interaction cross-section to the parameter space of rare and frequent velocity-dependent self-interactions by studying the central densities of dark matter only isolated haloes. For these upper-bound parameters, we find that the offsets just after the first pericentre to be $\leq$ 10 kpc. On the other hand, because of BCG oscillations, we speculate that the distribution of BCG offsets in relaxed cluster to be a statistically viable probe. Therefore, this motivates further studies of BCG off-centering in cosmological simulations.</p>

<p>Confronting measurements of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest with cosmological hydrodynamical simulations has produced stringent constraints on models of particle dark matter and the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium. We investigate the robustness of such models of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, focussing on the effect of particle initial conditions on the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest statistics in cosmological SPH simulations. We study multiple particle initialization algorithms in simulations that are designed to be identical in other respects. In agreement with the literature, we find that the correct linear theory evolution is obtained when a glass-like configuration is used for initial unperturbed gas particle positions alongside a regular grid configuration for dark matter particles and the use of non-identical initial density perturbations for gas and dark matter. However, we report that this introduces a large scale-dependent distortion in the one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ transmission power spectrum at small scales ($k &gt; 0.05$s/km). The effect is close to $50\%$ at $k\sim 0.1$s/km, and persists at higher resolution. This can severely bias inferences in parameters such as the dark matter particle mass. By considering multiple initial conditions codes and their variations, we also study the impact of a variety of other assumptions and algorithmic choices, such as adaptive softening, background radiation density, particle staggering, and perturbation theory accuracy, on the matter power spectrum, the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux power spectrum, and the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux PDF. This work reveals possible pathways towards more accurate theoretical models of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest to match the quality of upcoming measurements.</p>

<p>Dark matter self-interactions may have the capability to solve or at least mitigate small-scale problems of the cosmological standard model, {\Lambda}CDM. There are a variety of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models that lead to distinguishable astrophysical predictions and hence varying success in explaining observations. Studies of dark matter (DM) density cores on various mass scales suggest a velocity-dependent scattering cross-section. In this work we investigate how a velocity dependence alters the evolution of the DM distribution for frequent DM scatterings and compare to the velocity-independent case. We demonstrate that these cases are qualitatively different using a test problem. Moreover, we study the evolution of the density profile of idealised DM haloes and find that a velocity dependence can lead to larger core sizes and different time scales of core formation and core collapse. In cosmological simulations, we investigate the effect of velocity-dependent self-interaction on haloes and satellites in the mass range of $\approx 10^{11} - 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$. We study the abundance of satellites, density and shape profiles and try to infer qualitative differences between velocity-dependent and velocity-independent scatterings as well as between frequent and rare self-interactions. We find that a strongly velocity-dependent cross-section can significantly amplify the diversity of rotation curves, independent of the angular dependence of the differential cross-section. We further find that the abundance of satellites in general depends on both the velocity dependence and the scattering angle, although the latter is less important for strongly velocity-dependent cross-sections.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Constraining Bianchi-I universe with Pantheon SNIa data</strong>, Anshul Verma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07661v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07661v1</a></p>

<p>We study the Bianchi-I cosmological model motivated by signals of statistical isotropy violation seen in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and others. To that end, we consider various kinds of anisotropic matter that source anisotropy in our model, specifically cosmic strings, magnetic fields, domain walls and Lorentz violation generated magnetic fields. These anisotropic matter sources, taking one at a time, are studied for their co-evolution with standard model (isotropic) sources viz., dust-like (dark/normal) matter and dark energy modelled as cosmological constant. We constrain the Hubble parameter, density fractions of anisotropic matter, isotropic cold dark matter (CDM) and dark energy ($\Lambda$) in a Bianchi-I universe with planar symmetry i.e., with a global ellipsoidal geometry, and try to find signatures of a cosmic preferred axis if any. Pantheon Type Ia Supernova (SNIa) data is used in our study to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters of this model. In our analysis, we found a cosmic axis of anisotropy using SN1e data. Interestingly this preferred axis lies in the same direction, broadly, as some other cosmic anisotropy axes reported in the literature such as the CMB hemispherical power asymmetry, etc., with some of anisotropic sources considered. We also found a non-zero evidence for cosmic shear and eccentricity for our universe with those sources. To be more conclusive, we require more SNIa host galaxy data for tighter constraints on distance and absolute magnitude calibration which we hope will be available from the future JWST observations and other surveys.</p>

<p>Gravitational particle production of spectator fields due to the expansion universe during the inflationary and reheating phases of the early universe is of particular interest in the context of dark matter, since it allows to constrain the properties of the dark candidate by comparing the density of particles produced with the observed dark matter abundance. In such processes, tachyonic instabilities arise as a consequence of the coupling to the curvature, greatly enhancing mode production. In this work, we consider a massive vector field that is coupled to the curvature scalar and the Ricci tensor only, and study its gravitational production through inflation and reheating. We show how the mechanism is more efficient than in the case of a non-minimally coupled scalar field, giving rise to larger abundances. Moreover, we analyze the importance of the coupling to the Ricci tensor, which increases tachyonic instabilities in the system, and constrain the mass of the dark particle and the values of the coupling constants by comparing the corresponding abundance with observations</p>

<p>In this work, we assume the FRLW Universe which is filled with dark matter along with dark energy in the framework of Horava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity. The dark energy is considered as the Linear (Model I) and CPL (Model II) parametrizations of the equation of state parameter. For both models, we express the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ in terms of the model parameters and redshift $z$. To rigorously constrain the model, we have employed a comprehensive set of recent observational datasets including cosmic chronometers (CC), Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Gamma-ray Burst (GRB), Quasar (Q) and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB). Through the joint analysis of this diverse collection of datasets, we have achieved tighter constraints on the modelâs parameters. This, in turn, allows us to delve into both the physical and geometrical aspects of the model with greater precision. Furthermore, our analysis has enabled us to determine the present values of crucial cosmological parameters, including $H_{0}$, $\Omega_{m0}$, $\Omega_{k0}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda0}$. Itâs noteworthy that our results are consistent with recent findings from Planck 2018, underscoring the reliability and relevance of our models in the current cosmological context. We also conduct analysis of cosmographic parameters and apply statefinder and diagnostic tests to explore the evolution of the Universe. In addition, the AIC and BIC suggest that the $\Lambda$CDM model is the preferred model among all our considered models. Our investigation into the models has unveiled intriguing features of the late universe</p>

<p>The Hubble constant $H_0$ is one of the important cosmological parameters measuring the expansion rate of our universe at present moment. Over the last couple of years, $H_0$ has created an enormous amount of debates interests in the astrophysical and cosmological communities for its different estimations at many standard deviations by different observational surveys. The recent estimation of $H_0$ from the cosmic microwave background observations by Planck within the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm is in tension with $\gtrsim 5 \sigma$ confidence with SH0ES (Supernovae and $H_0$ for the Equation of State of dark energy) collaboration. As a result, revision of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model has been suggested in various ways in order to examine whether such scenarios can solve this $H_0$ tension. Among the list of the proposed cosmological scenarios, in this chapter we focus on a generalized cosmological theory in which the dark components of the universe, namely, Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) are allowed to interact with each other in a non-gravitational way, widely known as the Interacting DE or Coupled DE scenarios. These interacting scenarios have received magnificent attention in the scientific community for their appealing consequences. Specifically, in the context of $H_0$ tension, it has been observed that the interacting DE scenarios can lead to higher values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) value, and consequently, the tension on $H_0$ can be either alleviated or solved. In this chapter we review various interacting DE scenarios and their roles in alleviating the $H_0$ tension.</p>

<p>This study presents a general outline of the Qitai radio telescope (QTT) project. Qitai, the site of the telescope, is a county of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China, located in the east Tianshan Mountains at an elevation of about 1800 m. The QTT is a fully steerable, Gregorian type telescope with a standard parabolic main reflector of 110 m diameter. The QTT has adopted an um-brella support, homology-symmetric lightweight design. The main reflector is active so that the deformation caused by gravity can be corrected. The structural design aims to ultimately allow high-sensitivity observations from 150 MHz up to 115 GHz. To satisfy the requirements for early scientific goals, the QTT will be equipped with ultra-wideband receivers and large field-of-view mul-ti-beam receivers. A multi-function signal-processing system based on RFSoC and GPU processor chips will be developed. These will enable the QTT to operate in pulsar, spectral line, continuum and Very Long Baseline Interferometer (VLBI) observing modes. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and radio frequency interference (RFI) control techniques are adopted throughout the system design. The QTT will form a world-class observational platform for the detection of low-frequency (nanoHertz) gravitational waves through pulsar timing array (PTA) techniques, pulsar surveys, the discovery of binary black-hole systems, and exploring dark matter and the origin of life in the universe.</p>

<p>Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with electroweak charges, such as the wino and the Higgsino, stand out as natural candidates for dark matter in the universe. In this paper, we study the search for WIMPs at future multi-TeV $\mu^+\mu^+$ colliders. We investigate both the direct production search of WIMPs through the mono-muon channel and the indirect search through quantum corrections in elastic $\mu^+\mu^+$ Moller scattering. We find that the indirect search has an advantage over the direct search with sufficient luminosities, $\mathcal{O}(\text{ab}^{-1})$, and low systematic uncertainties, $\lesssim 0.3\,\%$. This advantage arises due to the weaker mass dependence observed in the indirect search in comparison to direct production methods. The advantage is further enhanced if the initial muon beams are polarized. Specifically, we demonstrate that the indirect search method can detect the thermal mass target for the wino and the Higgsino for $\sqrt{s} = 6\,\text{TeV}$ and $2\,\text{TeV}$ (with $\sqrt{s}$ being the center of mass energy), respectively, with $10\,\text{ab}^{-1}$, an $80\,\%$ polarized beam and an accuracy of $0.1\,\%$. Our findings illuminate the potential of future high-energy $\mu^+\mu^+$ colliders in advancing our understanding of dark matter.</p>

<p>The classical field approximation is widely used to better understand the predictions of ultra-light dark matter. Here, we use the truncated Wigner approximation method to test the classical field approximation of ultra-light dark matter. This method approximates a quantum state as an ensemble of independently evolving realizations drawn from its Wigner function. The method is highly parallelizable and allows the direct simulation of quantum corrections and decoherence times in systems many times larger than have been previously studied in reference to ultra-light dark matter. Our study involves simulation of systems in 1, 2, and 3 spatial dimensions. We simulate three systems, the condensation of a Gaussian random field in three spatial dimensions, a stable collapsed object in three spatial dimensions, and the merging of two stable objects in two spatial dimensions. We study the quantum corrections to the classical field theory in each case. We find that quantum corrections grow exponentially during nonlinear growth with the timescale being approximately equal to the system dynamical time. In stable systems the corrections grow quadratically. We also find that the primary effect of quantum corrections is to reduce the amplitude of fluctuations on the deBroglie scale in the spatial density. Finally, we find that the timescale associated with decoherence due to gravitational coupling to Baryonic matter is at least as fast as the quantum corrections due to gravitational interactions. These results strongly imply that quantum corrections do not impact the predictions of the classical field theory.</p>

<p>An explanation of the nature of dark energy has been treated in extra dimensions within the scheme of string theory. One of the most successful models is inspired by the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model, in which the universe is a 4-dimensional brane embedded in a 5-dimensional Minkowski space-time. In this landscape, the study of the evolution of the normal branch has led us to different kinds of dark energy, where the most simple case is the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Moreover, other viable cosmological solutions are related to agegraphic dark energy, which allows a late cosmic acceleration within an interacting mechanism. To explore the viability of these solutions and a possible gravitational leakage, in this paper, we present constraints on such models using recent standard sirens forecasting in addition to local observables such as Supernovae Type Ia. Our results show that the value associated with the species of quantum fields $n$ in these models is strongly restricted for supernovae observations to $n=20$, and for GW standard sirens mock data prefers a value of $n=1$.</p>

<p>Neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes are the remnants of massive star explosions. Most massive stars reside in close binary systems, and the interplay between the companion star and the newly formed compact object has been theoretically explored, but signatures for binarity or evidence for the formation of a compact object during a supernova explosion are still lacking. Here we report a stripped-envelope supernova, SN 2022jli, which shows 12.4-day periodic undulations during the declining light curve. Narrow H$\alpha$ emission is detected in late-time spectra with concordant periodic velocity shifts, likely arising from hydrogen gas stripped from a companion and accreted onto the compact remnant. A new Fermi/LAT $\gamma$-ray source is temporally and positionally consistent with SN 2022jli. The observed properties of SN 2022jli, including periodic undulations in the optical light curve, coherent H$\alpha$ emission shifting, and evidence for association with a $\gamma$-ray source, point to the explosion of a massive star in a binary system leaving behind a bound compact remnant. Mass accretion from the companion star onto the compact object powers the light curve of the supernova and generates the $\gamma$-ray emission.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Bird-Snack: Bayesian Inference of dust law $R_V$ Distributions using SN Ia Apparent Colours at peaK</strong>, Sam M. Ward et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07753v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07753v1</a></p>

<p>To reduce systematic uncertainties in Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology, the host galaxy dust law shape parameter, $R_V$, must be accurately constrained. We thus develop a computationally-inexpensive pipeline, Bird-Snack, to rapidly infer dust population distributions from optical-near infrared SN colours at peak brightness, and determine which analysis choices significantly impact the population mean $R_V$ inference, $\mu_{R_V}$. Our pipeline uses a 2D Gaussian process to measure peak $BVriJH$ apparent magnitudes from SN light curves, and a hierarchical Bayesian model to simultaneously constrain population distributions of intrinsic and dust components. Fitting a low-to-moderate-reddening sample of 65 low-redshift SNe yields $\mu_{R_V}=2.61^{+0.38}_{-0.35}$, with $68\%(95\%)$ posterior upper bounds on the population dispersion, $\sigma_{R_V}&lt;0.92(1.96)$. This result is robust to various analysis choices, including: the model for intrinsic colour variations, fitting the shape hyperparameter of a gamma dust extinction distribution, and cutting the sample based on the availability of data near peak. However, these choices may be important if statistical uncertainties are reduced. With larger near-future optical and near-infrared SN samples, Bird-Snack can be used to better constrain dust distributions, and investigate potential correlations with host galaxy properties. Bird-Snack is publicly available; the modular infrastructure facilitates rapid exploration of custom analysis choices, and quick fits to simulated datasets, for better interpretation of real-data inferences.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Constraining Bianchi-I universe with Pantheon SNIa data</strong>, Anshul Verma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07661v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07661v1</a></p>

<p>We study the Bianchi-I cosmological model motivated by signals of statistical isotropy violation seen in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and others. To that end, we consider various kinds of anisotropic matter that source anisotropy in our model, specifically cosmic strings, magnetic fields, domain walls and Lorentz violation generated magnetic fields. These anisotropic matter sources, taking one at a time, are studied for their co-evolution with standard model (isotropic) sources viz., dust-like (dark/normal) matter and dark energy modelled as cosmological constant. We constrain the Hubble parameter, density fractions of anisotropic matter, isotropic cold dark matter (CDM) and dark energy ($\Lambda$) in a Bianchi-I universe with planar symmetry i.e., with a global ellipsoidal geometry, and try to find signatures of a cosmic preferred axis if any. Pantheon Type Ia Supernova (SNIa) data is used in our study to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters of this model. In our analysis, we found a cosmic axis of anisotropy using SN1e data. Interestingly this preferred axis lies in the same direction, broadly, as some other cosmic anisotropy axes reported in the literature such as the CMB hemispherical power asymmetry, etc., with some of anisotropic sources considered. We also found a non-zero evidence for cosmic shear and eccentricity for our universe with those sources. To be more conclusive, we require more SNIa host galaxy data for tighter constraints on distance and absolute magnitude calibration which we hope will be available from the future JWST observations and other surveys.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Hadronic Re-Acceleration at the Crab Pulsar Wind Termination Shock as a Source of PeV Gamma-Rays</strong>, Samuel T. Spencer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07429v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07429v1</a></p>

<p>Recent results from LHAASO and Tibet AS$\gamma$ suggest that the Crab Nebulaâs gamma-ray spectrum extends to the PeV energy range, however the production mechanisms of this highest energy emission remain unclear. It has been postulated that a secondary component of hadronic emission could explain the highest energy gamma-ray flux points, however the origin and acceleration mechanism for this hadronic population has yet to be explained. We postulate one scenario in which hadrons diffuse over time into the Crab pulsar wind nebula from the surrounding supernova ejecta, and are subsequently re-accelerated by the pulsar wind termination shock. We present results of direct particle transport simulations (including radial evolution) to determine if this scenario is viable over the lifetime of the Crab system.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>Cosmological Test of Dark Energy Parametrizations in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity</strong>, Madhur Khurana et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07410v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07410v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we assume the FRLW Universe which is filled with dark matter along with dark energy in the framework of Horava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity. The dark energy is considered as the Linear (Model I) and CPL (Model II) parametrizations of the equation of state parameter. For both models, we express the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ in terms of the model parameters and redshift $z$. To rigorously constrain the model, we have employed a comprehensive set of recent observational datasets including cosmic chronometers (CC), Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Gamma-ray Burst (GRB), Quasar (Q) and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB). Through the joint analysis of this diverse collection of datasets, we have achieved tighter constraints on the modelâs parameters. This, in turn, allows us to delve into both the physical and geometrical aspects of the model with greater precision. Furthermore, our analysis has enabled us to determine the present values of crucial cosmological parameters, including $H_{0}$, $\Omega_{m0}$, $\Omega_{k0}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda0}$. Itâs noteworthy that our results are consistent with recent findings from Planck 2018, underscoring the reliability and relevance of our models in the current cosmological context. We also conduct analysis of cosmographic parameters and apply statefinder and diagnostic tests to explore the evolution of the Universe. In addition, the AIC and BIC suggest that the $\Lambda$CDM model is the preferred model among all our considered models. Our investigation into the models has unveiled intriguing features of the late universe</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>On the interacting dark energy scenarios $-$ the case for Hubble constant tension</strong>, Supriya Pan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07260v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07260v1</a></p>

<p>The Hubble constant $H_0$ is one of the important cosmological parameters measuring the expansion rate of our universe at present moment. Over the last couple of years, $H_0$ has created an enormous amount of debates interests in the astrophysical and cosmological communities for its different estimations at many standard deviations by different observational surveys. The recent estimation of $H_0$ from the cosmic microwave background observations by Planck within the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm is in tension with $\gtrsim 5 \sigma$ confidence with SH0ES (Supernovae and $H_0$ for the Equation of State of dark energy) collaboration. As a result, revision of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model has been suggested in various ways in order to examine whether such scenarios can solve this $H_0$ tension. Among the list of the proposed cosmological scenarios, in this chapter we focus on a generalized cosmological theory in which the dark components of the universe, namely, Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) are allowed to interact with each other in a non-gravitational way, widely known as the Interacting DE or Coupled DE scenarios. These interacting scenarios have received magnificent attention in the scientific community for their appealing consequences. Specifically, in the context of $H_0$ tension, it has been observed that the interacting DE scenarios can lead to higher values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) value, and consequently, the tension on $H_0$ can be either alleviated or solved. In this chapter we review various interacting DE scenarios and their roles in alleviating the $H_0$ tension.</p>

<p>2023-10-11, <strong>A survey of SiO $J=$ 1 â 0 emission toward massive star-forming regions</strong>, W. -J. Kim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07257v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.07257v1</a></p>

<p>The application of silicon monoxide (SiO) as a shock tracer arises from its propensity to occur in the gas phase as a result of shock-induced phenomena, including outflow activity and interactions between molecular clouds and expanding HII regions or supernova remnants. We searched for indications of shocks toward 366 massive star-forming regions by observing the ground rotational transition of SiO ($v=0$, $J=1-0$) at 43 GHz with the Korean VLBI Network (KVN) 21 m telescopes to extend our understanding on the origins of SiO in star-forming regions. We detected SiO emission toward 104 regions that consist of 57 IRDCs, 21 HMPOs, and 26 UCHIIs. The determined median SiO column density, $N$(SiO), and abundance, $X$(SiO), relative to $N$(H$_2$) are $8.12\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $1.28\times10^{-10}$, respectively. These values are similar to those obtained toward other star-forming regions and also consistent with predicted values from shock models with low-velocity shocks ($\lesssim$10 - 15 km s$^{-1}$). While the $X$(SiO) does not exhibit any strong correlation with the evolutionary stages of their host clumps, $L_{\rm SiO}$ is highly correlated with dust clump mass, and $L_{\rm SiO}/L_{\rm bol}$ also has a strong negative correlation with $T_{\rm dust}$. This shows that colder and younger clumps have high $L_{\rm SiO}/L_{\rm bol}$ suggestive of an evolutionary trend. This trend is not due to excess emission at higher velocities, such as SiO wing features, as the colder sources with high $L_{\rm SiO}/L_{\rm bol}$ ratios lack wing features. Comparing SiO emission with H$_2$O and Class I CH$_3$OH masers, we find a significant correlation between $L_{\rm SiO}$/$L_{\rm bol}$ and $L_{\rm CH_3OH}/L_{\rm bol}$ ratios, whereas no similar correlation is seen for the H$_2$O maser emission. This suggests a similar origin for the SiO and Class I CH$_3$OH emission in these sources.</p>
