<p>2025-04-02, <strong>Interference with Gravitational Instability: Hot and Fuzzy Dark Matter</strong>, Rayne Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01937v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01937v1</a></p>

<p>Wave or fuzzy dark matter produced with high momenta behaves in many ways like hot particle dark matter while also possessing seemingly different phenomenology due to wave interference. We develop wave perturbation theory to show that white noise density fluctuations generated by the interference of high-momenta waves are gravitationally unstable in the usual way during matter domination above the free streaming scale and stabilize below the free streaming scale, much like the analogous effects for massive neutrinos in hot dark matter. We verify and illustrate these effects in the density power spectra of Newtonian Schr"odinger-Poisson simulations. In the cosmological context, this would cause a gradual suppression of the initial white noise isocurvature perturbations below the free streaming scale at matter radiation equality, unlike cold dark matter isocurvature fluctuations, and virial stability of dark matter halos.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>A minimal Pati-Salam theory: from cosmic defects to gravitational waves and colliders</strong>, Goran Senjanović et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01893v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01893v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss a minimal renormalizable Pati-Salam theory based on the $SU(4)_{\rm C}\,\times\,SU(2)_{\rm L}\,\times\,SU(2)_{\rm R}$ gauge group, with unification scale Higgs multiplets taken as $SU(2)_{\rm L}$ and $SU(2)_{\rm R}$ doublets, which lead to neutrino Dirac picture. Although a number of scalar particles could be light, even lying at the LHC energies, the unification scale is hopelessly out of reach in any foreseeable future. Moreover, phase transition in the early Universe leads to the production of magnetic monopoles and domain walls, both incompatible with the standard cosmological model. A small explicit breaking of the discrete left-right symmetry allows the domain walls to decay, and in the process possibly sweep away the monopoles, analogously to the previously discussed case of $SU(5)$ grand unified theory. This leaves an important imprint of gravitational waves, within the reach of next generation searches, correlated with monopole detection and new light particles at collider energies. The theory has a dark matter candidate in the form of an inert scalar doublet, with a mass below TeV, which can further trigger electroweak baryogenesis.</p>

<p>The SND@LHC experiment was built for observing neutrinos arising from LHC pp collisions. The detector consists of two sections: a target instrumented with SciFi modules and a hadronic calorimeter/muon detector. Energetic $\nu$N collisions in the target produce hadronic showers. Reconstruction of the shower total energy requires an estimate of the fractions deposited in both the target and the calorimeter. In order to calibrate the SND@LHC response, a replica of the detector was exposed to hadron beams with 100 to 300 GeV in the CERN SPS H8 test beam line in Summer 2023. This report describes the methods developed to tag the presence of a shower, to locate the shower origin in the target, and to combine the target SciFi and the calorimeter signals so to measure the shower total energy.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>Entanglement and Bell Nonlocality in $τ^+ τ^-$ at the LHC using Machine Learning for Neutrino Reconstruction</strong>, Yulei Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01496v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01496v1</a></p>

<p>Experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have accumulated an unprecedented amount of data corresponding to a large variety of quantum states. Although searching for new particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics remains a high priority for the LHC program, precision measurements of the physical processes predicted in the Standard Model continue to lead us to a deeper understanding of nature at high energies. We carry out detailed simulations for the process $pp \to \tau^+\tau^- X$ to perform quantum tomography and to measure the quantum entanglement and the Bell nonlocality of the $\tau^+\tau^-$ two qubit state, including both statistical and systematic uncertainties. By using advanced machine learning techniques for neutrino momentum reconstruction, we achieve precise measurements of the full spin density matrix, a critical advantage over previous studies limited by reconstruction challenges for missing momenta. Our analysis reveals a clear observation of Bell nonlocality with high statistical significance, surpassing 5$\sigma$, establishing $\tau^+ \tau^-$ as an ideal system for quantum information studies in high-energy collisions. Given its experimental feasibility and the high expected sensitivity for Bell nonlocality, we propose that $\tau^+ \tau^-$ should be regarded as the new benchmark system for quantum information studies at the LHC, complementing and extending the insights gained from the $t\bar{t}$ system.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>What KM3-230213A events may tell us about the neutrino mass and dark matter</strong>, Basabendu Barman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01447v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01447v1</a></p>

<p>Within the framework of general $U(1)$ scenario, we demonstrate that the ultra high energy neutrinos recently detected by KM3NeT could originate from a decaying right handed neutrino dark matter (DM), with a mass of 440 PeV. Considering DM production via freeze-in, we delineate the parameter space that satisfies the observed relic abundance and also lies within the reach of multiple gravitational wave detectors. Our study provides a testable new physics scenario, enabled by multi-messenger astronomy.</p>

<p>2025-04-01, <strong>Optical surface reflectivity characterization in water Cherenkov detectors: methodologies and industrial applications</strong>, Deepak Tiwari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00947v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.00947v1</a></p>

<p>Understanding the optical properties of various components in water Cherenkov (WC) neutrino experiments is essential for accurate detector characterization, which is critical for precise measurements. Of particular importance is the characterization of surface reflectivity within the Cherenkov volume. We present a methodology for surface reflectivity characterization using a goniometer setup, addressing the challenges associated with measurements in the air and water (or other optical media). Additionally, we discuss the broader implications of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) measurements using a goniometer, including their industrial applications.</p>

<p>2025-04-01, <strong>Two-loop Renormalization Group Equations in the $ν$SMEFT</strong>, Di Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00792v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.00792v1</a></p>

<p>We calculate two-loop renormalization group equations (RGEs) in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) with right-handed neutrinos, i.e., the so-called $\nu$SMEFT, up to dimension five. Besides the two-loop RGEs of dimension-five (dim-5) operators, we also present those of the renormalizable couplings, including contributions from dim-5 operators. We check consistency relations among the first and second poles of $\varepsilon \equiv (4-d)/2$ with $d$ being the space-time dimension for all renormalization constants and find that those for lepton doublet and right-handed neutrino wave-function renormalization constants, as well as for renormalization constants of charged-lepton and neutrino Yukawa coupling matrices, do not hold. This leads to divergent RG functions for these fields and Yuwawa coupling matrices. We figure out that such infinite RG functions arise from the non-invariance of fields and Yukawa coupling matrices under field redefinitions, considering that flavor transformations are a kind of linear field redefinitions. Those infinite RG functions will disappear once one restores contributions from the derivative of renormalization constants with respect to the Wilson coefficients of redundant operators or, alternatively, considers the RGEs of flavor invariants, which are physical quantities and remain invariant under field redefinitions.</p>

<p>2025-04-01, <strong>Nuclear Matrix Elements for Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay</strong>, Anthony V. Grebe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00358v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.00358v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) is a rare hypothesised process that, if discovered, would establish that the neutrino is Majorana, that is, it is its own antiparticle. Interpretation of experimental results relies on knowledge of nuclear matrix elements, whose large model uncertainty is the limiting factor in comparing measured (bounds on) half-lives to the neutrino mass. Nuclear effective field theory and lattice QCD have the potential to compute these matrix elements with better control over uncertainties, enhancing the discovery potential of next-generation $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments. This work will survey various lattice QCD double-beta decay calculations and discuss their implications.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>Individual halo bias in models of $f(R)$ gravity</strong>, Jorge Enrique García-Farieta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01958v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01958v1</a></p>

<p>Halo bias links the statistical properties of the spatial distribution of dark matter halos to those of the underlying dark matter field, providing insights into clustering properties in both general relativity (GR) and modified-gravity scenarios such as $f(R)$ models. While the primary halo mass-dependent bias has been studied in detailed, the secondary bias, which accounts for the additional dependencies on other internal halo properties, can offer a sensitive probe for testing gravity beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model. To quantify any potential deviations between $\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$ gravity models in halo clustering, at both the primary and secondary level, as well as in the distributions of halo properties in the cosmic web. Using $N$-body simulations of $f(R)$ gravity models, we assess the scaling relations and the primary and secondary bias signals of halo populations on the basis of a halo-by-halo estimator of large-scale effective bias. Our analysis is performed using halo number density as the independent variable. The relative difference in the effective bias between the $f(R)$ models and $\Lambda$CDM is sensitive, albeit slightly, to the power index of modified gravity. The largest deviations from GR are measured for low-mass halos, where the average bias at fixed number density decreases by up to 5\% for fixed scaling indices. We also show that the scaling relations for some environmental properties, including neighbour statistics, Mach number and local overdensity, exhibit small but non-negligible deviations (~3-5\%) from GR for a wide range of number densities. Our results also suggests that the properties of halos in sheets and voids show the largest departures from GR (&gt; 10\% in some cases). In terms of secondary bias, we do not find any statistically significant deviations with respect to $\Lambda$CDM for any of the properties explored in this work.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>Enhancing European Cooperation in the Search for Dark Matter</strong>, Bernard Andrieu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01688v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01688v1</a></p>

<p>The search for dark matter is an exciting topic that is pursued in different communities over a wide range of masses and using a variety of experimental approaches. The result is a strongly correlated matrix of activities across Europe and beyond, both on the experimental and the theoretical side. We suggest to encourage and foster the collaboration of the involved institutions on technical, scientific and organisational level, in order to realise the synergies that are required to increase the impact of dark matter research and to cope with the increasing experiment sizes. The suggested network – loosely titled “DMInfraNet” – could be realised as a new initiative of the European strategy or be based on existing structures like iDMEu or DRD. The network can also serve as a nucleus for future joint funding proposals.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>Singularity-free cosmology from interactions in the dark sector</strong>, Molly Burkmar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01683v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01683v1</a></p>

<p>We study the dynamics of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker models where a dark energy component with a quadratic equation of state (EoS) nonlinearly interacts with cold dark matter. Thus, two energy scales naturally come into play: $\rho_<em>$ is the scale at which the nonlinearity of the EoS becomes relevant; $\rho_i$ is the energy scale around which the interaction starts to play an important role in the dynamics. Our focus is to understand whether there are parameter ranges for this system that can produce non-singular bouncing and emergent cosmologies for any initial condition. We complete a dynamical systems analysis, and find the parameter range such that trajectories always expand from a high energy non-singular de Sitter state. For flat and negative curvature models this de Sitter state is represented by a fixed point, the asymptotic past from which the universe emerges from. We find a subset of positive curvature models that during contraction get arbitrarily close to the de Sitter state, thus having a quasi-de Sitter bounce, then emerge from the bounce and expand, evolving toward spatial flatness. We find that the dimensionless parameter $q\equiv \rho_</em>/\rho_i$, which measures the relative strength of the nonlinear terms in the system, plays a crucial role in the topology of the phase space. When $q &lt; 3$, some trajectories expand toward a singularity, while others evolve toward a low energy cosmological constant at late-times, with a subset going through a decelerated matter dominate era before the final acceleration. When $q &gt; 3$, all trajectories are non-singular, and evolve toward a late-time cosmological constant. We find a subclass in this case in which all trajectories have at least one decelerated matter dominated phase, and accelerate at late-times.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>The CosmoVerse White Paper: Addressing observational tensions in cosmology with systematics and fundamental physics</strong>, Eleonora Di Valentino et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01669v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01669v1</a></p>

<p>The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological description of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and cosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed by a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described by the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution, as well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation through general relativity. There have always been open questions about the soundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have shown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the emergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White Paper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming decade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these challenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the measurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical confidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys. We also discuss the growing set of novel data analysis approaches that go beyond traditional methods to test physical models. [Abridged]</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>Bounds on the Gell-Mann ~-~Low functions in quantum electrodynamics and in the Wess-Zumino model</strong>, N. V. Krasnikov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01514v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01514v1</a></p>

<p>We derive bounds $ |\frac{d\psi(\alpha)}{d\alpha}| \leq 1 $, $ \frac{d(\frac{d\psi(\alpha)}{d\alpha}\psi(\alpha))}{d\alpha} \leq 1 $   on the GL (Gell-Mann ~-~Low) function $\psi(\alpha)$ from the Kallen-Lehmann dispersion representation in quantum electrodynamics.   We also derive analogous bounds for the GL function in the Wess-Zumino model.   The implications of the obtained inequalities are discussed. In particular, we obtain bounds on coupling   constants in dark photon model and in dark matter model with vector $(B-L)$ messenger.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>Multi-wavelength properties of $z\gtrsim 6$ LISA detectable events</strong>, Srija Chakraborty et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01327v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01327v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the intrinsic and observational properties of $z\gtrsim 6$ galaxies hosting coalescing massive black holes (MBHs) that gives rise to gravitational waves (GWs) detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We adopt a zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy formation and black hole (BH) co-evolution, zoomed-in on a $M_h \sim 10^{12}~\rm M_{\odot}$ dark matter halo at z = 6, which hosts a fast accreting super-massive black hole (SMBH) and a star-forming galaxy. Following the SMBH formation backward in time, we identify the merging events that concurred to its formation and we pick up the ones that are detectable with LISA. Among these LISA detectable events (LDEs), we select those that, based on their intrinsic properties are expected to be bright in one or more electromagnetic (EM) bands. We post-process these events with dust radiative transfer calculations to make predictions about their spectral energy distributions and continuum maps in the JWST to ALMA wavelength range. We compare the spectra arising from galaxies hosting the merging MBHs with those arising from AGN powered by single accreting BHs. We find that it will be impossible to identify an LDE from the continuum SEDs because of the absence of specific imprints from the merging MBHs. We also compute the profile of the H$_{\rm \alpha}$ line arising from LDEs, considering the contribution from their star-forming regions and the accreting MBHs. We find that the presence of two accreting MBHs would be difficult to infer even if both MBHs accrete at super-Eddington rates. We conclude that the combined detection of GW and EM signals from $z\gtrsim 6$ MBHs is challenging not only because of the poor sky-localization provided by LISA, but also because the loudest GW emitters are not massive enough to leave significant signatures in the emission lines arising from the broad line region.</p>

<p>2025-04-01, <strong>Formation and Environmental Context of Giant Bulgeless Disk Galaxies in the Early Universe: Insights from Cosmological Simulations</strong>, Fangzhou Jiang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01070v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01070v1</a></p>

<p>Giant bulgeless disk galaxies, theoretically expected to be rare in the early Universe, have been confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to exist as early as 2 billion years after the Big Bang. These morphologically extreme systems offer valuable insights into the physics of disk formation and the interplay between galaxies and their dark-matter halos. Using cosmological simulations, we identify analogs of such galaxies with stellar masses around $10^{11} M_\odot$ and half-light radii up to 6 kpc at $z \sim 3$ and characterize the factors that contribute to their formation. These galaxies form in young cosmic knots, populating host halos of high spin, low concentration, and spherical shapes. They feature dynamically coherent circum-galactic medium, as well as gas-rich, coherent mergers, which preserve their disk morphology and drive their large sizes. Interestingly, all the simulated giant disks harbor a compact, aligned inner disk, marginally resolvable in JWST images with a S'ersic index near unity.

<p>We investigate the scenario of interacting dark energy through a detailed confrontation with various observational datasets. We quantify the interaction in a general way, through the deviation from the standard scaling of the dark matter energy density. We use observational Hubble Data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), data from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the recently released DESI DR2, data from Supernova Type Ia (SNIa), both with and without calibration by SH0ES, and finally the CMB data from Planck 2018. For the basic and simplest interacting model, we find that the data favor a non-zero interaction up to $2\sigma$. Notably, when we employ SH0ES-calibrated SNIa data the preference of non-zero interaction becomes more significant. However, comparison with $\Lambda$CDM scenario through AIC, BIC and Bayesian analysis, reveals a mixed picture.</p>

<p>Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) have revealed compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy, challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. In this work, we adopt a data-driven, model-independent approach to reconstruct the dark energy equation of state (EoS) and its potential interaction with dark matter using combined background cosmological datasets, including DESI DR2, cosmic chronometers, observational Hubble data, and Type Ia supernovae. Using Gaussian Process regression and a non-parametric formalism, we first confirm a $\sim 2\sigma$ indication of dynamical dark energy, featuring a phantom crossing around redshift $z \sim 0.4$, consistent with DESI results. We then explore the implications of dynamical EoS from DESI DR2 for dark sector coupling. Incorporating priors on the EoS from DESI DR2, we find a $2.2\sigma$ signal for non-zero interactions between dark energy and dark matter at low redshift. Our results suggest that if DESI’s evidence for time-varying dark energy is confirmed, a coupled dark sector may be a necessary extension beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</p>

<p>High redshift Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are expected to be extremely powerful probes of our Universe. However, while a significant number of FRBs are expected to exist at high redshift, detecting them has been difficult, with only a handful robustly confirmed at redshifts greater than one. In many other fields, gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters has enabled high redshift detections by magnifying background sources. In this work we forecast the populations of FRBs expected to be detected by CHIME and upcoming instrument CHORD, for blank fields and by lensing through a range of strong lensing galaxy clusters, based on existing, observationally driven cluster models. We find that the presence of a galaxy cluster of mass $M\geq5\times10^{14} M_\odot$ within the detection beam of a transit telescope will approximately double the rate of detected high redshift ($z\geq1$ CHIME, $z\geq2$ CHORD) FRBs for that beam. Consequently, we find that knowledge of cluster positions can be used by instruments like CHIME or CHORD in tandem with novel observational strategies to isolate a sample of high redshift FRBs with $\gtrsim50\%$ purity at rate of $\lesssim3$ per year. This would provide a statistically high redshift sample of mostly gravitationally lensed FRBs, that would be ideal candidates for optical follow-up, constraining the FRB-star formation relation and for use in cosmological studies including measuring $H_0$, characterising dark matter substructures and probing reionization.</p>

<p>2025-04-01, <strong>Model Agnostic $F(R)$ Gravity Inflation</strong>, V. K. Oikonomou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00915v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.00915v1</a></p>

<p>In this work we construct a formalism that can reveal the general characteristics of classes of viable $F(R)$ inflationary theories. The assumptions we make is that the slow-roll era occurs, and that the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$ of the $F(R)$ gravity is positive or zero, for both the inflationary and late-time quasi de Sitter eras, a necessary condition for the stability of the de Sitter spacetime. In addition, we require that the de Sitter scalaron mass is also a monotonically increasing function of the Ricci scalar, or it has an extremum. Also the $F(R)$ gravity function is required to depend on the two known fundamental scales in cosmology, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the mass scale $m_s^2=\frac{\kappa^2 \rho_m^{(0)}}{3}$, with $\rho_m^{(0)}$ denoting the energy density of the cold dark matter at the present epoch, that is $F(R)=F(R,\Lambda,m_s^2)$. Using these general assumptions we provide the general features of viable classes of $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theories which remarkably can also simultaneously describe successfully the dark energy era. This unique feature of a unified description of the dark energy and inflationary eras stems from the requirement of the monotonicity of the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$. These viable classes are either deformations of the $R^2$ model or $\alpha$-attractors type theories. The analysis of the viability of a general $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theory is reduced in evaluating the parameter $x=\frac{R F_{RRR}}{F_{RR}}$ and the first slow-roll index of the theory, either numerically or approximately. We also disentangle the power-law $F(R)$ gravities from power-law evolution.</p>

<p>We investigate the gravitational lensing of a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole with a global monopole at finite distances. In this asymptotically nonflat spacetime, the deflection angle of light is decomposed into two parts: the first derives from the orbit differential equation, and the second originates from the metric itself. By absorbing the cosmological constant into the effective impact parameter, we derive an analytical expression for the first part using elliptic integrals. Combined with the second part, we obtain a complete exact solution for the deflection angle in this context. Additionally, considering that the distances from the source to the observer are large, we derive expressions for the light deflection angle in both the weak and strong field limits. In both cases, we find that the deflection is enhanced by the presence of the global monopole, further supporting its potential role as an alternative to elusive dark matter.</p>

<p>Axion dark matter coupled via QCD induces a non-zero differential acceleration between test masses of different composition. Tests of the equivalence principle, like the recent MICROSCOPE space mission, are sensitive to such a signal. We use the final released data of the MICROSCOPE experiment, to search for this effect. We find no positive signal consistent with the dark matter model, and set upper limits on the axion-gluon coupling that improve existing laboratory bounds by up to two orders of magnitude for axion masses in the $10^{-17}$ eV to $10^{-13}$ eV range.</p>

<p>The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely the dark energy driving the late-universe acceleration and the dark matter that is responsible for the structure formation. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that cosmology with one unified dark fluid can also explain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The present work aims to provide a clearer physical interpretation of the Wang et al. 2024 results. We show that the unified dark fluid model can produce primary CMB temperature and polarization power spectra that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction (relative difference $\lesssim 10^{-4}$). The model can also mimic the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history and linear growth factor on sub-horizon scales with percent-level accuracy. With better physical understanding of the model, we make precision tests and find a minor error in the Boltzmann code used in Wang et al. 2024. We correct the error and update the model comparison between $\Lambda$CDM and the unified dark fluid model.</p>

<p>We investigate general relativistic effects on the photon spectrum emitted from decaying (or annihilating) particle dark matter in the halo surrounding a primordial black hole. The spectrum undergoes significant modification due to gravitational redshifts, which induces broadening as a result of the intense gravitational field near the black hole. This characteristic alteration in the photon spectrum presents a unique observational signature. Future observations of such spectral features may provide critical evidence for a mixed dark matter scenario, involving both primordial black holes and particle dark matter.</p>

<p>The Belle II collaboration recently reported a $2.7\sigma$ excess in the rare decay $B^\pm \to K^\pm \nu \bar{\nu}$, potentially signaling new physics. We propose an axion-like particle (ALP)-portal dark matter (DM) framework to explain this anomaly while satisfying the observed DM relic abundance. By invoking a resonant annihilation mechanism ($m_a \sim 2m_\chi$), we demonstrate that the ALP-mediated interactions between the Standard Model and DM sectors simultaneously account for the $B^\pm \to K^\pm \nu \bar{\nu}$ anomaly and thermal freeze-out dynamics. Two distinct scenarios-long-lived ALPs decaying outside detectors (displaced diphotons) and ALPs decaying invisibly to DM pairs (missing energy)-are examined. While the displaced diphotons scenario is excluded by kaon decay bounds ($K^\pm \to \pi^\pm + \text{inv.}$), the invisible decay channel remains unconstrained and aligns with Belle II’s missing energy signature. Using the coupled Boltzmann equation formalism, we rigorously incorporate early kinetic decoupling effects, revealing deviations up to a factor of 20 from traditional relic density predictions in resonance regions. For the missing energy scenario, the viable parameter space features ALP-SM and ALP-DM couplings: $g_{aWW} \in (7.3 \times 10^{-5} - 1.1 \times 10^{-4})\, \text{GeV}^{-1}$ (from $B^\pm \to K^\pm a$) and $g_{a\chi\chi} \in (6.1\times10^{-5} - 6.0\times 10^{-3})\, \text{GeV}^{-1}$ (for resonant annihilation), accommodating ALP masses $m_a \in (0.6, 4.8)\, \text{GeV}$. Therefore, this work establishes the ALP portal as a viable bridge between the $B^\pm \to K^\pm \nu \bar{\nu}$ anomaly and thermal DM production, emphasizing precision calculations of thermal decoupling in resonance regimes.</p>

<p>Typically, the interaction between dark matter and ordinary matter is assumed to be very small. Nevertheless, in this article, I show that the effective resonant absorption of dark photon dark matter in the atmosphere is definitely possible. This might also be associated with the alleged temperature anomalies observed in our upper stratosphere. By allowing a small amount of additional energy deposition to our upper stratosphere, a narrow dark matter mass range $m_A \sim 0.0001-0.001$ eV and the corresponding range of the mixing parameter $\varepsilon$ are constrained for the first time. This proposal might overturn our usual assumption of extremely weak interaction between dark matter and ordinary matter and revive the hope of detecting dark matter directly. Some important implications of this proposal such as the heating of planets and supermassive dark stars would also be discussed.</p>

<p>The distance duality relation (DDR) relates two independent ways of measuring cosmological distances, namely the angular diameter distance and the luminosity distance. These can be measured with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), respectively. Here, we use recent DESI DR1, Pantheon+, SH0ES and DES-SN5YR data to test this fundamental relation. We employ a parametrised approach and also use model-independent Generic Algorithms (GA), which are a machine learning method where functions evolve loosely based on biological evolution. When we use DESI and Pantheon+ data without Cepheid calibration or big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), there is a $2\sigma$ violation of the DDR in the parametrised approach. Then, we add high-redshift BBN data and the low-redshift SH0ES Cepheid calibration. This reflects the Hubble tension since both data sets are in tension in the standard cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM. In this case, we find a significant violation of the DDR in the parametrised case at $6\sigma$. Replacing the Pantheon+ SNe Ia data by DES-SN5YR, we find similar results. For the model-independent approach, we find no deviation in the uncalibrated case and a small deviation with BBN and Cepheids which remains at 1$\sigma$. This shows the importance of considering model-independent approaches for the DDR.</p>

<p>This paper outlines the scientific goals and observational strategies of the Mini-SiTian array. Mounted at Xinglong Observatory, the Mini-SiTian array consists of three 30 cm telescopes and has been in operation since 2022. The large field of view, combined with the capability for multi-band photometric observations, enables the Mini-SiTian array to perform rapid follow-up observations to identify optical counterparts of gravitational waves, capture the early light curves of tidal disruption events and supernovae, and monitor stellar flares, Be star outbursts, and cataclysmic variable stars, although its limiting magnitude is not very deep. By collaborating with the Xinglong 2.16-m telescope and leveraging a real-time image processing pipeline, simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations could be performed to reveal their underlying physical mechanisms. The observational and research experience provide critical guidance for the implementation of the full-scale SiTian project in the future.</p>

<p>This paper provides a comprehensive introduction to the Mini-SiTian Real-Time Image Processing pipeline (STRIP) and evaluates its operational performance. The STRIP pipeline is specifically designed for real-time alert triggering and light curve generation for transient sources. By applying the STRIP pipeline to both simulated and real observational data of the Mini-SiTian survey, it successfully identified various types of variable sources, including stellar flares, supernovae, variable stars, and asteroids, while meeting requirements of reduction speed within 5 minutes. For the real observational dataset, the pipeline detected 1 flare event, 127 variable stars, and 14 asteroids from three monitored sky regions. Additionally, two datasets were generated: one, a real-bogus training dataset comprising 218,818 training samples, and the other, a variable star light curve dataset with 421 instances. These datasets will be used to train machine learning algorithms, which are planned for future integration into STRIP.</p>

<p>In various types of supernovae (SNe), strong interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) has been reported. This raises questions on their progenitors and mass-loss processes shortly before the explosion. Recently, the bright long-lived Type~II SN 2021irp was proposed to be a standard Type II SN interacting with disk-like CSM. The observational properties suggest that the progenitor was a massive star in a binary system and underwent a mass-ejection process due to the binary interaction just before the explosion. Here, we study the diversity of the observational properties of bright long-lived Type II (21irp-like) SNe. We analyse the diversity of their CSM properties, in order to understand their progenitors and mass-loss mechanisms and their relations with the other types of interacting SNe. We performed photometry, spectroscopy, and/or polarimetry for four 21irp-like SNe. Based on these observations as well as published data of SN~2021irp itself and well-observed bright and long-lived type II SNe including SNe~2010jl, 2015da and 2017hcc, we discuss their CSM characteristics. This sample of SNe shows luminous and long-lived photometric evolution, with some variations in the photometric evolution (from $\sim-17$ to $\sim-20$ absolute mag in the $r$/$o$ band even at $\sim 200$ days after the explosion). They show photospheric spectra characterized mainly by Balmer lines for several hundreds of days, with some variations in the shapes of the lines. They show high polarization with slight variations in the polarization degrees with rapid declines with time (from $\sim3-6$ \% before the peak to $\sim1$ \% at $\sim200$ days after the peak). The observational properties are consistent with the disk-CSM-interaction scenario, i.e., typical Type~II SNe interacting with disk-like CSM.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>Producing type Ia supernovae from hybrid CONe white dwarfs with main-sequence binary companions at low metallicity of Z = 0.0001</strong>, Boyang Guo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01412v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01412v1</a></p>

<p>The nature of progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and their explosion mechanism remain unclear. It has been suggested that SNe Ia may be resulted from thermonuclear explosions of hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon white dwarfs(CONe WDs) when they grow in mass to approach the Chandrasekhar mass limit by accreting matter from a binary main-sequence (MS) companion. In this work, we combine the results of detailed binary evolution calculations with population synthesis models to investigate the rates and delay times of SNe Ia in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001. For a constant star formation rate of 5 M_sun yr-1, our calculations predict that the SN Ia rates in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity of Z = 0.0001 is about 0.11 - 3.89 * 10-4 yr-1. In addition,delay times in this channel cover a wide range of 0.05 - 2.5 Gyr. We further compare our results to those given by previous study for the CONe WD + MS channel with higher metallicity of Z = 0.02 to explore the influence of metallicity on the results. We find that these two metallicity environments give a slight difference in rates and delay times of SNe Ia from the CONe WD + MS channel, although SNe Ia produced at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001 have relatively longer delay times.</p>

<p>2025-04-01, <strong>Persistent radio sources associated with fast radio bursts: Implications from magnetar progenitors</strong>, Sk. Minhajur Rahaman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01125v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01125v1</a></p>

<p>The rare association of three persistent radio sources (confirmed PRS1 and PRS2, candidate PRS3) with repeating fast radio bursts (FRB 20121102A, 20190520B, 20201124A) offers a unique probe into their magneto-ionic environments. PRSs are attributed to synchrotron emission from relativistic charged particles of magnetar wind nebula (MWN) powered by spin-down magnetohydrodynamic wind or internal magnetic field decay. Using a multizone hydrodynamic model, we track MWN evolution to constrain magnetar progenitor properties. For PRS1 and PRS2, we find an equipartition radius $R_\mathrm{eq} \sim 0.1 $ pc that is consistent with the radio scintillation estimates ($&gt; 0.03$ pc) and radio imaging limits ($&lt;0.7$ pc). This compact size favors low expansion speeds and large initial spin periods, $P_\mathrm{i} \gtrsim 10$ ms, ruling out millisecond magnetar progenitors. Given $P_\mathrm{i} \gtrsim 10$ ms, a current size of $\sim 0.1$ pc, a supernova kinetic energy $E_\mathrm{ SN} \sim 10^{50}-10^{51}$ erg and an ejecta mass $M \sim 3-10 \; M_{\odot}$, the PRS age is $t \sim 10-10^{2}$ yr. PRSs with $t&gt;20$ years require an internal field ($B_\mathrm{int} \sim 10^{16}-10^{16.5}\;$G) with a decay timescale $t_\mathrm{d} \sim 10-10^{2.5}$ yr. The slowest field decay ($t_\mathrm{d,max} \sim 500$ yr) favors sub-energetic supernovae ($E_\mathrm{SN} \sim 10^{50}$ erg) with massive ejecta ($M \gtrsim 10\; M_{\odot}$) and low ionization fraction ($\sim 3\% $). For the sub-energetic scenario for the confirmed PRSs, we predict a cooling break at $100-150$ gigahertz at $20-40 \; \mu \text{Jy}$ and self-absorption near 200 megahertz at $180\; \mu \text{Jy}$. For PRS3, a rotation-powered MWN is viable only if $t \sim 10$ yr; an inverted spectrum beyond 150 gigahertz would rule out this scenario.</p>

<p>Through gravitational lensing, galaxy clusters can magnify supernovae (SNe) and create multiple images of the same SN. This enables measurements of cosmological parameters, which will be increasingly important in light of upcoming telescopic surveys. We study the prospects of detecting strongly lensed SNe in cluster fields with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman)’s High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We employed two approaches: one focusing on known multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters, along with the SN rates specific to those galaxies, and another based on the expected number of lensed SNe exploding in a given volume behind a galaxy cluster. We collected all the clusters in the literature that feature a well-constrained lens model and multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters with high-quality data for the lensed galaxies. This allowed us to determine the SN rate for each galaxy. We provide predictions for 46 clusters visible to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, as well as for 9 observable by Roman’s HLTDS, depending on whether the clusters fall within the survey’s observing field. We predict that the number of multiply imaged SNe discovered by LSST in its first three years is $3.95 \pm 0.89$ from the first approach or $4.94 \pm 1.02$ from the second. For the HLTDS, the expected number of multiply imaged SNe ranges from $0.38 \pm 0.15$ to $5.2 \pm 2.2$, depending on the specific cluster observed, however, the fields to be targeted remain a matter of discussion. We conclude that LSST offers great prospects for detecting multiply imaged SNe. Our predictions are effectively lower limits, as we only considered the most massive and well-studied clusters. We provide a recommendation for HLTDS observing field selection, namely: either MACS J0553.4-3342 or Abell 1758a should be observed by the survey.</p>

<p>Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs, peculiar and underluminous compared to the normal type Ia supernovae. Observations of SNe Iax provide insight into the physics of white-dwarf explosions and suggest that some may not be terminal events. Late-time photometry ($\sim$1400 days post-peak) of the type Iax SN 2012Z, the only white dwarf supernova with a pre-explosion detection of a progenitor system, revealed a flux excess that may be explained by a gravitationally bound remnant driving a radioactively powered wind. We present further late-time Hubble Space Telescope photometry of SN 2012Z, $\sim$2500 days after the explosion, and find that the SN is still brighter than, but trending towards, the pre-explosion flux. Additionally, we observe that the excess F555W flux seen in previous data has grown more pronounced. The color of the excess flux disfavors a light echo or interaction with the circumstellar material. The decline rate of the excess flux is consistent with energy deposition from $^{55}$Fe, but the luminosity is higher than expected from models of the ejecta, further suggesting evidence for a bound remnant. Combining our data with future observations should allow for the detection of emission from the ejecta shock-heating of the companion helium star seen in the progenitor system.</p>

<p>We investigate the scenario of interacting dark energy through a detailed confrontation with various observational datasets. We quantify the interaction in a general way, through the deviation from the standard scaling of the dark matter energy density. We use observational Hubble Data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), data from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the recently released DESI DR2, data from Supernova Type Ia (SNIa), both with and without calibration by SH0ES, and finally the CMB data from Planck 2018. For the basic and simplest interacting model, we find that the data favor a non-zero interaction up to $2\sigma$. Notably, when we employ SH0ES-calibrated SNIa data the preference of non-zero interaction becomes more significant. However, comparison with $\Lambda$CDM scenario through AIC, BIC and Bayesian analysis, reveals a mixed picture.</p>

<p>Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) have revealed compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy, challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. In this work, we adopt a data-driven, model-independent approach to reconstruct the dark energy equation of state (EoS) and its potential interaction with dark matter using combined background cosmological datasets, including DESI DR2, cosmic chronometers, observational Hubble data, and Type Ia supernovae. Using Gaussian Process regression and a non-parametric formalism, we first confirm a $\sim 2\sigma$ indication of dynamical dark energy, featuring a phantom crossing around redshift $z \sim 0.4$, consistent with DESI results. We then explore the implications of dynamical EoS from DESI DR2 for dark sector coupling. Incorporating priors on the EoS from DESI DR2, we find a $2.2\sigma$ signal for non-zero interactions between dark energy and dark matter at low redshift. Our results suggest that if DESI’s evidence for time-varying dark energy is confirmed, a coupled dark sector may be a necessary extension beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</p>

<p>We conduct an analysis of over 60,000 dwarf galaxies (7&lt;=log(M_*/M_\odot)&lt;=10) in search of photometric variability indicative of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Using data from the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE), a time domain survey on the Pan-STARRS telescopes, we construct light curves for each galaxy in up to four bands (griz) where available. We select objects with AGN-like variability by fitting each light curve to a damped random walk (DRW) model. After quality cuts and removing transient contaminants, we identify 1100 variability-selected AGN candidates (representing 2.4% of the available sample). We analyze their spectra to measure various emission lines and calculate black hole (BH) masses, finding general agreement with previously found mass scaling-relations and nine potential IMBH candidates. Furthermore, we re-analyze the light curves for our candidates to calculate the dampening timescale tau_DRW associated with the DRW and see a similar correlation between this value and the BH mass. Finally, we estimate the active fraction as a function of stellar mass and see evidence that active fraction increases with host mass.</p>

<p>In this study we investigate potential large-angle anisotropies in the angular distribution of the cosmological parameters $H_0$ (the Hubble constant) and $\Omega_m$ (the matter density) in the flat-$\Lambda$CDM framework, using the Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae catalog. For this we perform a directional analysis by dividing the celestial sphere into a set of directions, and estimate the best-fit cosmological parameters across the sky using a MCMC approach. Our results show a dominant dipolar pattern for both parameters in study, suggesting a preferred axis in the universe expansion and in the distribution of matter. However, we also found that for $z \gtrsim 0.015$, this dipolar behavior is not statistically significant, confirming the expectation – in the $\Lambda$CDM scenario – of an isotropic expansion and a uniform angular distribution of matter (both results at $1\,\sigma$ confidence level). Nevertheless, for nearby supernovae, at distances $\lesssim 60$ Mpc or $z \lesssim 0.015$, the peculiar velocities introduce a highly significant dipole in the angular distribution of $H_0$. Furthermore, we perform various robustness tests that support our findings, and consistency tests of our methodology.</p>

<p>We present a comparative study of 22 core-collapse supernovae (SNe), selected to explore a novel, multidimensional ranking scheme aimed at identifying the best supernova. Each SN is evaluated based on three principal criteria: (1) inferred explosion energy derived from light curve modeling and spectroscopic indicators; (2) an aesthetic score assigned to the SN host galaxy following transformation into a human face using a generative visual model (Midjourney v5); and (3) final ranking by Claud.IA, a 6-month-old infant trained to select the best SN via repeated exposure to curated SN images. We define and normalize all criteria to ensure statistical consistency across the sample, with particular attention paid to the biases inherent in infant-based classification models. The top five SNe exhibit both high explosion energies (E &gt; 1e51 erg) and extremely cool host galaxies (post transformation), with Claud.IA showing strong preferences toward galaxies exhibiting symmetric facial morphology and prominent spiral arms. Final application of Claud.IA identified the best supernova in our sample as SN 2022joj. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating human-machine hybrid aesthetic judgment and early developmental cognition into astrophysical classification, and raises intriguing questions about the nature of bestness in cosmic explosions. Additional follow-up is encouraged.</p>

<p>2025-04-01, <strong>One-parameter dynamical dark energy: Hints for oscillations</strong>, Daniel A. Kessler et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00776v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.00776v1</a></p>

<p>There is mounting evidence from multiple cosmological probes that dark energy may be dynamical, with an equation of state that evolves over cosmic time. While this evidence is typically quantified using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, based on a linear expansion of $w(a)$ in the scale factor, non-parametric reconstructions frequently suggest non-linear features, particularly at late times. In this work, we investigate four minimal one-parameter models of dark energy with non-linear dependence on the scale factor. These models are constrained using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck, lensing reconstruction from ACT-DR6, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI-DR2, and three Type-Ia supernovae (SNe) samples (PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3), considered independently. Although our conclusions depend on the choice of SNe sample, we consistently find a preference, as measured by the chi-squared statistic and the Bayesian evidence, for these dynamical dark energy models over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Notably, with the PantheonPlus dataset, one model shows strong Bayesian evidence ($\Delta \ln B \simeq 4.5$) against CPL, favoring an equation of state that peaks near $a \simeq 0.7$ and oscillates near the present day. These results highlight the impact of SNe selection and contribute to the growing collection of evidence for late-time deviations from $\Lambda$CDM.</p>
