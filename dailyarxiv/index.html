<p>2024-01-22, <strong>Towards a more complete description of hybrid leptogenesis</strong>, Rohan Pramanick et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12189v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.12189v1</a></p>

<p>Hybrid leptogenesis framework combining type I and type II seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass necessarily include scattering topologies involving both the scalar triplet and the right handed neutrino. We demonstrate that a systematic inclusion of these mixed scatterings can significantly alter the evolution of the number densities leading to an order of magnitude change in the predicted value of present-day asymmetry. We provide quantitative limit on the degeneracy of the seesaw scales where the complete analysis becomes numerically significant, limiting the validity of leptogenesis being dominated by the lightest seesaw species.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>Awakening of A Blazar at Redshift 2.7 Temporally Coincident with Arrival of Cospatial Neutrino Event IceCube-201221A</strong>, Xiong Jiang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12122v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.12122v1</a></p>

<p>We report on multiwavelength studies of the blazar NVSS J171822+423948, which is identified as the low-energy counterpart of 4FGL J1718.5+4237, the only gamma-ray source known to be cospatial with the IceCube neutrino event IC-201221A. After a 12-year long quiescent period undetected by Fermi-LAT, gamma-ray activities with a tenfold flux increase emerge soon (a few tens of days) after arrival of the neutrino. Associated optical flares in the ZTF $g$, $r$, and $i$ bands are observed together with elevated WISE infrared fluxes. Synchronized variations suggest that both the gamma-ray emission and the neutrino event are connected to the blazar. Furthermore, the optical spectrum reveals emission lines at a redshift $z$ = 2.68 $\pm$ 0.01. Thus, it is the first candidate for a neutrino-emitting blazar at the redshift above 2. Discussions of theoretical constraints of neutrino production and comparisons with other candidates are presented.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>New IceTop Trigger in the context of the planned IceCube Surface Detector Enhancement at the South Pole</strong>, Ek Narayan Paudel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12026v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.12026v1</a></p>

<p>IceTop is the square kilometer surface array for cosmic-ray air showers of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole. IceTop consists of 81 stations, each comprised of a pair of ice-Cherenkov tanks, which over the years loses sensitivity due to snow coverage. This motivated the plan to enhance IceTop by the deployment of elevated scintillation panels and radio antennas. Coincident detection of an air shower with the IceTop tanks, the scintillators, and the antennas will increase the measurement accuracy of the cosmic-ray properties. While the radio antennas of the enhancement have a higher sensitivity to inclined showers, the current IceTop trigger, requiring coincident hits of both tanks of a station, loses efficiency for such showers. Therefore, we studied the feasibility of adding a trigger based on the multiplicity of single tank hits and studied its performance with simulations and data including a one-day test run at the South Pole. In this paper, we present the plans for the surface enhancement and the studies for the new IceTop trigger.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>Citizen Science for IceCube: Name that Neutrino</strong>, R. Abbasi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11994v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.11994v1</a></p>

<p>Name that Neutrino is a citizen science project where volunteers aid in classification of events for the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, an immense particle detector at the geographic South Pole. From March 2023 to September 2023, volunteers did classifications of videos produced from simulated data of both neutrino signal and background interactions. Name that Neutrino obtained more than 128,000 classifications by over 1,800 registered volunteers that were compared to results obtained by a deep neural network machine-learning algorithm. Possible improvements for both Name that Neutrino and the deep neural network are discussed.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>Neutrino masses in cosmology</strong>, S. Gariazzo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11976v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.11976v1</a></p>

<p>We review the status of neutrino mass constraints obtained from cosmological observations, with a particular focus on the results derived considering Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data by various experiments (Planck, ACT and SPT), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) determinations and other late-universe probes. We discuss the role played by priors and parameterizations in the Bayesian analyses, both at the time of determining neutrino masses or their ordering, and compare cosmological bounds with terrestrial constraints on both quantities.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>The 3-3-1 model with exotic electric charges, right-handed neutrinos with type-I+II seesaw mechanism and its effects on LFV</strong>, Abrar Ahmad et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11828v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.11828v2</a></p>

<p>In this research, we propose a modified version of the 3-3-1 model, incorporating a type I+II seesaw mechanism and Z4 discrete symmetry, as a framework for investigating lepton flavor-violating (LFV) decays. This model successfully yields the left-handed neutrinos mass square difference in the eV scale, with specific values of mass square differences; and generates mixing angles that align with experimental data. Furthermore, we develop SARAH and SPheno algorithms tailored for our modified model, enabling us to estimate the magnitude of LFV observables. Our calculations indicate favorable results for various LFV branching ratios. These findings demonstrate improved agreement with experimental measurements compared to previously reported results, which typically fall within the range of 10^-2 to 10^-6.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>The Design and Construction of the Chips Water Cherenkov Neutrino Detector</strong>, B. Alonso Rancurel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11728v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.11728v1</a></p>

<p>CHIPS (CHerenkov detectors In mine PitS) was a prototype large-scale water Cherenkov detector located in northern Minnesota. The main aim of the R&amp;D project was to demonstrate that construction costs of neutrino oscillation detectors could be reduced by at least an order of magnitude compared to other equivalent experiments. This article presents design features of the CHIPS detector along with details of the implementation and deployment of the prototype. While issues during and after the deployment of the detector prevented data taking, a number of key concepts and designs were successfully demonstrated.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>Constraining annihilating dark matter using the multi-frequency radio flux profiles of the M33 galaxy</strong>, Man Ho Chan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11668v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.11668v1</a></p>

<p>Radio data can give stringent constraints for annihilating dark matter. In general, radio observations can detect very accurate radio flux density with high resolution and different frequencies for nearby galaxies. We are able to obtain the radio flux density as a function of distance from the galactic center and frequencies $S(r,\nu)$. In this article, we demonstrate a comprehensive radio analysis of the M33 galaxy, combining the radio flux density profile $S(r)$ and the frequency spectrum $S(\nu)$ to get the constraints of dark matter annihilation parameters. By analyzing the archival radio data obtained from the Effelsberg telescope, we show that the dark matter annihilation contributing to the radio flux density might be insignificant in the disk region of the M33 galaxy. Moreover, by including the baryonic radio contribution, we constrain the $2\sigma$ conservative upper limits of the annihilation cross section, which can be complementary to the existing constraints based on neutrino, cosmic-ray, and gamma-ray observations. Our results indicate that analyzing the galactic multi-frequency radio flux profiles can give useful and authentic constraints on dark matter for the leptophilic annihilation channels.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>Gravitational Waves from Neutrino-Driven Core Collapse Supernovae: Predictions, Detection, and Parameter Estimation</strong>, Anthony Mezzacappa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11635v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.11635v1</a></p>

<p>Three-dimensional modeling has reached a level of maturity to provide detailed predictions of the gravitational wave emission in neutrino-driven core collapse supernovae. We review the status of these modeling efforts, current predictions for core collapse supernova gravitational wave emission, and the status of algorithms for the detection of core collapse supernova gravitational waves and the estimation of physical parameters associated with these events, which we hope to use to cull information about the central engine.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>The Scavenger Hunt for Quasar Samples to Be Used as Cosmological Tools</strong>, Maria Giovanna Dainotti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11998v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.11998v1</a></p>

<p>Although the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model is the most accredited cosmological model, information at high redshifts ($z$) between type Ia supernovae ($z=2.26$) and the Cosmic Microwave Background ($z=1100$) is crucial to validate this model further. To this end, we have discovered a sample of 1132 quasars up to $z=7.54$ exhibiting a reduced intrinsic dispersion of the relation between ultraviolet and X-ray fluxes, $\delta_\mathrm{F}=0.22$ vs. $\delta_\mathrm{F}=0.29$ ($24\%$ less), than the original sample. This gold sample, once we correct the luminosities for selection biases and redshift evolution, enables us to determine the matter density parameter $\Omega_M$ with a precision of 0.09. Unprecedentedly, this quasar sample is the only one that, as a standalone cosmological probe, yields such tight constraints on $\Omega_M$ while being drawn from the same parent population of the initial sample.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>Action and energy clustering of stellar streams in deforming Milky Way dark matter haloes</strong>, Richard A. N. Brooks et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11990v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.11990v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the non-adiabatic effect of time-dependent deformations in the Milky Way (MW) halo potential on stellar streams. Specifically, we consider the MW’s response to the infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and how this impacts our ability to recover the spherically averaged MW mass profile from observation using stream actions. Previously, action clustering methods have only been applied to static or adiabatic MW systems to constrain the properties of the host system. We use a time-evolving MW–LMC simulation described by basis function expansions. We find that for streams with realistic observational uncertainties on shorter orbital periods and without close encounters with the LMC, e.g. GD-1, the radial action distribution is sufficiently clustered to locally recover the MW mass profile across the stream radial range within a 2 sigma confidence interval determined using a Fisher information approach. For streams with longer orbital periods and close encounters with the LMC, e.g. Orphan-Chenab (OC), the radial action distribution disperses as the MW halo has deformed non-adiabatically. Hence, for OC streams generated in potentials that include a MW halo with any deformations, action clustering methods will fail to recover the mass profile within a 2 sigma uncertainty. Finally, we investigate whether the clustering of stream energies can provide similar constraints. Surprisingly, we find for OC-like streams, the recovered spherically averaged mass profiles demonstrate less sensitivity to the time-dependent deformations in the potential.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>Plasmon-enhanced Direct Detection of sub-MeV Dark Matter</strong>, Zheng-Liang Liang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11971v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.11971v1</a></p>

<p>Plasmon, a collective mode of electronic excitation in semiconductor materials, provides a unique avenue for the detection of light dark matter (DM). In this work, we first generalize the theoretical formalism of plasmon to treat the relativistic DM particles. We demonstrate that the plasmon resonance effect for sub-MeV DM can be significantly enhanced, particularly in scenarios of boosted DM with a light mediator. Utilizing the first data from SENSEI at SNOLAB, we derive a new strong limit on the sub-MeV DM-electron scattering cross section, which is more stringent than those from liquid detectors.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>Gravitational collapse of matter in the presence of non-minimally coupled Quintessence and Phantom-like scalar fields</strong>, Priyanka Saha et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11957v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.11957v1</a></p>

<p>This paper explores the evolution of the over-dense region of dark matter in the presence of a non-minimally coupled scalar field which is used to model quintessence and phantom-like dark energy. We focus on algebraic coupling, where the interaction Lagrangian is independent of the derivatives of the scalar field. To make our model more relativistic, like the minimal coupling scenario we studied earlier, we consider a spacetime structure that is internally closed Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime and externally the generalized Vaidya spacetime. This structure allows non-zero matter flux at the boundary of the over-dense region. Our investigation reveals that an increment of the coupling strength causes dark energy to cluster with dark matter at a certain cosmological scale where the influence of dark energy cannot be ignored. This phenomenon arises from the specific nature of the non-minimal coupling considered in this paper. While the evolution of matter’s energy density remains unchanged, the scalar field’s Klein-Gordon equation is modified, causing dark energy to deviate from its homogeneous state and cluster with dark matter. Similar to minimal coupling scenarios, closed spherical regions do not collapse within certain parameter ranges, exhibiting eternal expansion within the spatially flat FLRW spacetime acting as voids with decreasing matter density. The study extends our understanding of the cosmological scenarios where the virialization of the over-dense regions of dark matter is influenced by the non-minimally coupled dark energy.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>DarkGEO: A Large-Scale Laser-Interferometric Axion Detector</strong>, Joscha Heinze et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11907v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.11907v1</a></p>

<p>Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are leading candidates for dark matter. They are well motivated in many extensions of the Standard Model and supported by astronomical observations. We propose an iterative transformation of the existing facilities of the gravitational-wave detector and technology testbed GEO600, located near Ruthe in Germany, into a kilometre-scale upgrade of the laser-interferometric axion detector LIDA. The final DarkGEO detector could search for coincident signatures of axions and ALPs and significantly surpass the current constraints of both direct searches and astrophysical observations in the measurement band from $10^{-16}$ to $10^{-8}$ $\text{eV}$. We discuss realistic parameters and design sensitivities for the configurations of the different iteration steps as well as technical challenges known from the first LIDA results. The proposed DarkGEO detector will be well suited to probe the parameter space associated with predictions from theoretical models, like grand-unified theories, as well as from astrophysical evidence, like the cosmic infrared background.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>A warm dark matter cosmogony may yield more low-mass galaxy detections in 21-cm surveys than a cold dark matter one</strong>, Kyle A. Oman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11878v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.11878v1</a></p>

<p>The 21-cm spectral line widths, $w_{50}$, of galaxies are an approximate tracer of their dynamical masses, such that the dark matter halo mass function is imprinted in the number density of galaxies as a function of $w_{50}$. Correcting observed number counts for survey incompleteness at the level of accuracy needed to place competitive constraints on warm dark matter (WDM) cosmological models is very challenging, but forward-modelling the results of cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations into observational data space is more straightforward. We take this approach to make predictions for an ALFALFA-like survey from simulations using the EAGLE galaxy formation model in both cold (CDM) and WDM cosmogonies. We find that for WDM cosmogonies more galaxies are detected at the low-$w_{50}$ end of the 21-cm velocity width function than in the CDM cosmogony, contrary to what might na"ively be expected from the suppression of power on small scales in such models. This is because low-mass galaxies form later and retain more gas in WDM cosmogonies (with EAGLE). While some shortcomings in the treatment of cold gas in the EAGLE model preclude placing definitive constraints on WDM scenarios, our analysis illustrates that near-future simulations with more accurate modelling of cold gas will likely make strong constraints possible, especially in conjunction with new 21-cm surveys such as WALLABY.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>Axions and Primordial Magnetogenesis: the Role of Initial Axion Inhomogeneities</strong>, Filippo Anzuini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11822v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.11822v1</a></p>

<p>The relic density of dark matter in the $\Lambda$CDM model restricts the parameter space for a cosmological axion field, constraining the axion decay constant, the initial amplitude of the axion field and the axion mass. It is shown via lattice simulations how the relic density of axion-like particles with masses close to the one of the QCD axion is affected by axion-gauge field interactions and by initial axion inhomogeneities. For pre-inflationary axions, once the Hubble parameter becomes smaller than the axion mass, the latter starts to oscillate, and part of its energy density is spent producing gauge fields via parametric resonance. If the gauge fields are dark photons and Standard Model photons, the energy density of dark photons becomes higher than the one of the axion, while the high conductivity of the primordial plasma damps the oscillations of the photon field. Such a scenario allows for the production of small-scale, primordial magnetic fields, and it is found that the relic density of axions with a low decay constant are within the bounds set by the $\Lambda$CDM model, while GUT-scale axions are far too abundant. It is also shown that initial inhomogeneities of the axion field can change substantially the gauge field production, boosting or suppressing (depending on the axion parameters and couplings) the magnetogenesis mechanism with respect to an homogeneous axion field. It is found that when the axion mass is far lighter than the QCD axion model and the initial axion field is inhomogeneous, weak but cosmologically relevant magnetic field seeds can be generated on scales of the order of $0.1$ kpc.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>The Bayes factor surface for searches for new physics</strong>, Andrew Fowlie et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11710v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.11710v1</a></p>

<p>The Bayes factor surface is a new way to present results from experimental searches for new physics. Searches are regularly expressed in terms of phenomenological parameters - such as the mass and cross-section of a weakly interacting massive particle. Bayes factor surfaces indicate the strength of evidence for or against models relative to the background only model in terms of the phenomenological parameters that they predict. They provide a clear and direct measure of evidence, may be easily reinterpreted, but do not depend on choices of prior or parameterization. We demonstrate the Bayes factor surface with examples from dark matter, cosmology, and collider physics.</p>

<p>The reformulation of gravity as the Nambu-Goldstone mode associated with broken gauge symmetry is given and applied to cosmology. We find that; the new gravity consists of a scalar mode and a tensor mode, of which the tensor mode corresponds to the Einstein gravity; the universe pulsates without spacial curvature; the gravitational constant increases from zero as the universe expands and decreases to zero as the universe contracts; the dark energy is identified with the sum of the gravitational energies of scalar and tensor modes, while the dark matter is the mirage of the gravitational energy caused by the projection into the $\Lambda$CDM spectrum; the gravitational equation dictates the cosmological constant to be zero; the universe begins with inflation, and the present age of the universe is approximately 550Gy.</p>

<p>A viable model of large-field (chaotic) inflation with efficient production of primordial black holes is proposed in Starobinsky-like (modified) supergravity leading to the “no-scale-type” K"ahler potential and the Wess-Zumino-type (“renormalizable”) superpotential. The cosmological tilts are in good (within $1\sigma$) agreement with Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. In addition, the power spectrum of scalar perturbations has a large peak at smaller scales, which leads to a production of primordial black holes from gravitational collapse of large perturbations with the masses about $10^{17}$ g. The masses are beyond the Hawking (black hole) evaporation limit of $10^{15}$ g, so that those primordial black holes may be viewed as viable candidates for part or the whole of the current dark matter. The parameters of the superpotential were fine-tuned for those purposes, while the cubic term in the superpotential is essential whereas the quadratic term should vanish. The vacuum after inflation (relevant to reheating) is Minkowskian. The energy density fraction of the gravitational waves induced by the production of primordial black holes and their frequency were also calculated in the second order with respect to perturbations.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>A Snapshot Survey of Nearby Supernovae with the Hubble Space Telescope</strong>, Raphael Baer-Way et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12185v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.12185v1</a></p>

<p>Over recent decades, robotic (or highly automated) searches for supernovae (SNe) have discovered several thousand events, many of them in quite nearby galaxies (distances &lt; 30 Mpc). Most of these SNe, including some of the best-studied events to date, were found before maximum brightness and have associated with them extensive follow-up photometry and spectroscopy. Some of these discoveries are so-called SN impostors, thought to be superoutbursts of luminous blue variable stars, although possibly a new, weak class of massive-star explosions. We conducted a Snapshot program with the Hubble Space Telescope(HST) and obtained images of the sites of 31 SNe and four impostors, to acquire late-time photometry through two filters. The primary aim of this project was to reveal the origin of any lingering energy for each event, whether it is the result of radioactive decay or, in some cases, ongoing late-time interaction of the SN shock with pre-existing circumstellar matter, or the presence of a light echo. Alternatively, lingering faint light at the SN position may arise from an underlying stellar population (e.g., a host star cluster, companion star, or a chance alignment). The results from this study complement and extend those from Snapshot programs by various investigators in previous HST cycles.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>Determining Cosmological-model-independent $H_0$ with Gravitationally Lensed Supernova Refsdal</strong>, Xiaolei Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12052v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.12052v1</a></p>

<p>The reappearance of supernova Refsdal provides the time-delay distance, which serves as a powerful tool to determine the Hubble constant ($H_0$). We give a cosmological-model-independent method to estimate $H_0$ through Gaussian process regression, using time-delay measurement from this lensed supernova in combination with supernova data from Pantheon+ sample. Using eight cluster lens models for supernova Refsdal, we infer $H_0 = 64.2^{+4.4}_{-4.3} \, \rm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ and using two cluster models most consistent with the observations, we infer $H_0 = 66.3^{+3.8}_{-3.6} \, \rm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. Our estimations of $H_0$ are in $1\sigma$ agreement with the results assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM model and the uncertainties are comparable. Our constraint results on $H_0$ from the eight lens models and the two lens models indicate $2\sigma$ and $1.8\sigma$ tension with that estimated by SH0ES, respectively. However, our most probable values of $H_0$ from the two sets of lens models show good consistency with $H_0$ inferred from Planck CMB observations assuming $\Lambda$CDM model within $1\sigma$. We also find that our results for $H_0$ indicate $2\sigma$ deviations and $1.7\sigma$ deviations from the constraint results of $H_0$ using six time-delay quasars by H0LiCOW with the same analysis method.</p>

<p>Although the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model is the most accredited cosmological model, information at high redshifts ($z$) between type Ia supernovae ($z=2.26$) and the Cosmic Microwave Background ($z=1100$) is crucial to validate this model further. To this end, we have discovered a sample of 1132 quasars up to $z=7.54$ exhibiting a reduced intrinsic dispersion of the relation between ultraviolet and X-ray fluxes, $\delta_\mathrm{F}=0.22$ vs. $\delta_\mathrm{F}=0.29$ ($24\%$ less), than the original sample. This gold sample, once we correct the luminosities for selection biases and redshift evolution, enables us to determine the matter density parameter $\Omega_M$ with a precision of 0.09. Unprecedentedly, this quasar sample is the only one that, as a standalone cosmological probe, yields such tight constraints on $\Omega_M$ while being drawn from the same parent population of the initial sample.</p>

<p>2024-01-22, <strong>Three-Dimensional Velocity Diagnostics to Constrain the Type Ia Origin of Tycho’s Supernova Remnant</strong>, Hiroyuki Uchida et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11763v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2401.11763v1</a></p>

<p>While various methods have been proposed to disentangle the progenitor system for Type Ia supernovae, their origin is still unclear. Circumstellar environment is a key to distinguishing between the double-degenerate (DD) and single-degenerate (SD) scenarios since a dense wind cavity is expected only in the case of the SD system. We perform spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of Tycho’s supernova remnant (SNR) with XMM-Newton and reveal the three-dimensional velocity structure of the expanding shock-heated ejecta measured from Doppler-broadened lines of intermediate-mass elements. Obtained velocity profiles are fairly consistent with those expected from a uniformly expanding ejecta model near the center, whereas we discover a rapid deceleration ($\sim4000$ km s$^{-1}$ to $\sim1000$ km s$^{-1}$) near the edge of the remnant in almost every direction. The result strongly supports the presence of a dense wall entirely surrounding the remnant, which is confirmed also by our hydrodynamical simulation. We thus conclude that Tycho’s SNR is likely of the SD origin. Our new method will be useful for understanding progenitor systems of Type Ia SNRs in the era of high-angular/energy resolution X-ray astronomy with microcalorimeters.</p>
