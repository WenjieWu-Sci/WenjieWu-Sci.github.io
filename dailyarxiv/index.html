<p>2024-02-15, <strong>NSI effects on tripartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations</strong>, Lekhashri Konwar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09952v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.09952v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, we investigate the impact of new physics on different measures of tripartite entanglement within the context of three-flavor neutrino oscillations. These measures encompass concurrence, entanglement of formation, and negativity. We analyze the influence of new physics on these measures across a range of experimental setups involving both reactors and accelerators. Reactor experiments under consideration include Daya Bay, JUNO, and KamLAND setups, while accelerator experiments encompass T2K, MINOS, and DUNE. Our analysis reveals that accelerator experiments demonstrate greater sensitivity to NSI, with the most pronounced impact observed in the DUNE experiment. Negativity, while a weaker metric compared to EOF and concurrence, exhibits maximal sensitivity to NSI effects, particularly evident when neutrinos possess moderate to high energies. Conversely, reactor experiments demonstrate less sensitivity to NSI, with concurrence and EOF displaying more prominent effects.</p>

<p>2024-02-15, <strong>Neutron Stars constraints on a late G transition</strong>, Itzhak Goldman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09859v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.09859v1</a></p>

<p>It has been suggested recently that the Hubble tension could be eliminated by a sharp, $\sim 10\%$ increase of the effective gravitational constant at $z \sim 0.01$. This would decrease the luminosities of type 1a supernovae in just the needed amount to explain the larger value of the Hubble parameter. In the present paper we call attention to a dramatic effect of such transition on neutron stars. A neutron star that existed at $z=0.01$ would contract, conserving the baryon mass but undergoing a mass reduction. We computed neutron star models, with a realistic equation of state, and obtained that this reduction is typically $ 0.04 M_{\odot}$. This amounts to an energy of $7 \times 10^{52}$ erg. The transition will affect {\it all} neutron stars that formed along the history of each galaxy prior to the transition. Given the large number of neutron stars per galaxy, the liberated energy is huge. An estimate of the expected fluxes of neutrinos and x-rays yields values exceeding observational upper limits, thus rendering the late G transition scenario non-viable.</p>

<p>2024-02-15, <strong>Euclid preparation. Measuring detailed galaxy morphologies for Euclid with Machine Learning</strong>, Euclid Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10187v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.10187v1</a></p>

<p>The Euclid mission is expected to image millions of galaxies with high resolution, providing an extensive dataset to study galaxy evolution. We investigate the application of deep learning to predict the detailed morphologies of galaxies in Euclid using Zoobot a convolutional neural network pretrained with 450000 galaxies from the Galaxy Zoo project. We adapted Zoobot for emulated Euclid images, generated based on Hubble Space Telescope COSMOS images, and with labels provided by volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo: Hubble project. We demonstrate that the trained Zoobot model successfully measures detailed morphology for emulated Euclid images. It effectively predicts whether a galaxy has features and identifies and characterises various features such as spiral arms, clumps, bars, disks, and central bulges. When compared to volunteer classifications Zoobot achieves mean vote fraction deviations of less than 12% and an accuracy above 91% for the confident volunteer classifications across most morphology types. However, the performance varies depending on the specific morphological class. For the global classes such as disk or smooth galaxies, the mean deviations are less than 10%, with only 1000 training galaxies necessary to reach this performance. For more detailed structures and complex tasks like detecting and counting spiral arms or clumps, the deviations are slightly higher, around 12% with 60000 galaxies used for training. In order to enhance the performance on complex morphologies, we anticipate that a larger pool of labelled galaxies is needed, which could be obtained using crowdsourcing. Finally, our findings imply that the model can be effectively adapted to new morphological labels. We demonstrate this adaptability by applying Zoobot to peculiar galaxies. In summary, our trained Zoobot CNN can readily predict morphological catalogues for Euclid images.</p>

<p>2024-02-15, <strong>Variation of Fundamental Constants due to an Interaction with Ultralight Dark Matter and Constraints on the Yukawa-type Interactions mediated by Scalar Particles</strong>, V. A. Dzuba et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09643v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.09643v1</a></p>

<p>An interaction with scalar or pseudoscalar (axion) dark matter may cause the space-time variation of fundamental constants, and atomic spectroscopy provides us with a method of detecting these effects. In this paper, we study the effects produced by an oscillating nuclear mass $m_{N}$ and nuclear radius $r_{N}$ in two transition ratios: the comparison of the two-photon transition in atomic Hydrogen to the results from clocks based on the hyperfine transition in $^{133}$Cs, and the ratio of the two optical clock frequencies in Al$^{+}$ and Hg$^{+}$. The sensitivity of these frequencies ratios to changes in the nuclear mass $m_{N}$ and the nuclear radius $r_{N}$ allows us to extract, from experimental data, new limits on the variations of the proton mass, the quark mass, the QCD parameter $\theta$ and the interaction with axion dark matter. We also consider the Yukawa-type scalar field produced by the interaction of feebly interacting hypothetical scalar particles with Standard Model particles in the presence of massive bodies such as the Sun and the Moon. Using the data from the Al$^{+}$/Hg$^{+}$, Yb$^{+}$/Cs and Yb$^{+}$(E2)/Yb$^{+}$(E3) transition frequency ratios, we place constraints on the Yukawa-type interaction of the scalar field with photons, nucleons and electrons, for a range of scalar particle masses. We also consider limits on the Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) violating term ($c_{00}$) in the Standard Model Extension (SME) Lagrangian and the dependence of fundamental constants on gravity.</p>

<p>2024-02-15, <strong>Effective yields as tracers of feedback effects on metallicity scaling relations in the EAGLE cosmological simulations</strong>, M. C. Zerbo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09904v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.09904v1</a></p>

<p>Effective yields, $y_{\rm eff}$, are defined by fundamental galaxy properties (i.e., stellar mass -$M_{\star}$-, gas mass -$M_{\rm gas}$- and gas-phase metallicity). For a closed-box model, $y_{\rm eff}$ is constant and equivalent to the mass in metals returned to the gas per unit mass locked in long-lived stars. Deviations from such behaviour have been often considered observational signatures of past feedback events. By analysing EAGLE simulations with different feedback models, we evaluate the impact of supernovae (SN) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on $y_{\rm eff}$ at redshift $z=0$. When removing supermassive black holes (BH) and, hence, AGN effects, in simulations, galaxies are located around a plane in the $M_{\star} - M_{\rm gas} - {\rm O/H}$ parameter space (being O/H a proxy for gas metallicity, as usual), with such a plane roughly describing a surface of constant $y_{\rm eff}$. As the ratio between BH mass and $M_{\star}$ increases, galaxies deviate from that plane towards lower $y_{\rm eff}$ as a consequence of AGN feedback. For galaxies not strongly affected by AGN feedback, a stronger SN feedback efficiency generates deviations towards lower $y_{\rm eff}$, while galaxies move towards the opposite side of the plane (i.e., towards higher values of $y_{\rm eff}$) as SN feedback becomes weaker. Star-forming galaxies observed in the Local Universe are located around a similar 3D plane. Our results suggest that the features of the scatter around the observed plane are related to the different feedback histories of galaxies, which might be traced by $y_{\rm eff}$.</p>

<p>2024-02-15, <strong>The impact of anisotropic sky-sampling on the Hubble constant in numerical relativity</strong>, Hayley J. Macpherson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09659v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2402.09659v1</a></p>

<p>We study the impact of nearby inhomogeneities on an observerâs inference of the Hubble constant. Large-scale structures induce a dependence of cosmological parameters on observer position as well as an anisotropic variance of those parameters across an observerâs sky. While the former has been explored quite thoroughly, the latter has not. Incomplete sampling of an anisotropic sky could introduce a bias in our cosmological inference if we assume an isotropic expansion law. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations of large-scale structure combined with ray tracing to produce synthetic catalogs mimicking the low-redshift Pantheon supernova dataset. Our data contains all general-relativistic contributions to fluctuations in the distances and redshifts along geodesics in the simulation. We use these synthetic observations to constrain $H_0$ for a set of randomly-positioned observers. We study both the dependence on observer position as well as the impact of rotating the sample of supernovae on the observerâs sky. We find a 1â2\% variance in $H_0$ between observers when they use an isotropic sample of objects. However, we find the inferred value of $H_0$ can vary by up to 4â6\% when observers simply rotate their Pantheon data set on the sky. While the variances we find are below the level of the ``Hubble tensionââ, our results may suggest a reduction in the significance of the tension if anisotropy of expansion can be correctly accounted for.</p>
