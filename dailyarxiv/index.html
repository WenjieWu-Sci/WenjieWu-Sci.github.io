<p>2024-07-29, <strong>Inspecting binary-neutron-star mergers as production sites of high-energy neutrinos</strong>, Simone Rossoni et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19957v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.19957v1</a></p>

<p>The end state of binary-neutron-star (BNS) mergers can manifest conditions to produce high-energy neutrinos. Inspired by the event GW170817, detected in gravitational waves and in optical/infrared emission, we investigate a scenario in which cosmic-ray (CR) particles are accelerated, in a population of BNS mergers, in the energy range from the knee to the ankle. By taking into account the measured thermal and non-thermal energy density of the photon fields in the source environment as a function of the time after the merger, we model the CR interactions and the consequent neutrino production. We propagate the escaped CR and neutrino fluxes through the extragalactic space and compare the expected diffuse fluxes to the experimental data and current limits. Depending on the accelerated CR mass composition and on the contribution of this possible source class to the sub-ankle CR flux, we provide indications on the rate of BNS merger events and the amount of baryons present in the source site.</p>

<p>2024-07-29, <strong>Charged lepton flavour violation from inverse seesaw with flavour and CP symmetries</strong>, F. P. Di Meglio et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19734v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.19734v1</a></p>

<p>We study charged lepton flavour violation in a scenario in which light neutrino masses are generated via the inverse seesaw mechanism with 3+3 gauge singlet fermions, Ni and Sj, i,j=1,2,3. Lepton mixing is predicted with the help of the flavour symmetries Delta (3 n^2) and Delta (6 n^2) combined with CP. In the neutral lepton sector, the non-trivial flavour structure is only encoded in the Dirac neutrino Yukawa matrix (the coupling relating left-handed lepton doublets and gauge singlets Ni). Current experimental bounds on the processes mu -&gt; e gamma, mu -&gt; 3 e, mu-e conversion in nuclei and the tau lepton decays tau -&gt; l gamma and tau -&gt; 3 l, l=e, mu, do not constrain the considered parameter space of this scenario. Prospective limits on the decay mu -&gt; 3 e and mu-e conversion in aluminium instead can markedly reduce the available parameter space. We also comment on the effects of the heavy sterile states on light neutrino masses and lepton mixing.</p>

<p>2024-07-29, <strong>Common Origin of Dark Matter and Leptogenesis in $U(1)_{B-L}$</strong>, Ang Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19730v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.19730v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we investigate the common parameter space of dark matter and leptogenesis in the $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry. This model involves a complex scalar $\phi$, sterile neutrinos $N$, and Majorana dark matter $\chi$, where only dark matter $\chi$ is charged under the $Z_2$ symmetry. Masses of $N$ and $\chi$ are generated via the Yukawa interactions to $\phi$ after breaking of the $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry. TeV scale sterile neutrinos $N$ are responsible for the generation of baryon asymmetry through the resonance leptogenesis mechanism. The new particles in the $U(1)_{B-L}$ have a significant impact on the dilution of $N$, thus on leptogenesis. Meanwhile, the annihilation processes of dark matter $\chi$ are almost identical to that of $N$, which indicates that both leptogenesis and dark matter are closely related to satisfying the observed results simultaneously. Under various theoretical and experimental constraints, the viable common parameter space of dark matter and leptogenesis is obtained for both global and local $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry.</p>

<p>2024-07-28, <strong>Disentangling left-handed and right-handed neutrino effects in $B_c \to Ï\barÎ½_Ï$ decay</strong>, Quan-Yi Hu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19550v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.19550v1</a></p>

<p>Inspired by the anomalies in $B\to D^{(*)} \tau \bar{\nu}_\tau$ decay, in this work, we carefully study the influence of the most general dimension-six effective operators involving right-handed neutrinos on the four cascade decays $B_c \to \tau(\to \nu_\tau h ) \bar{\nu}_\tau $ ($h=\pi,\rho$) and $B_c \to \tau(\to \nu_\tau \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell) \bar{\nu}_\tau $ ($\ell =\mu, e$). We calculate for the first time the analytical results of the distributions of the differential decay rates of these cascade decays with respect to the energy of the charged particles in the final state. We select a total of 13 new physics benchmark points, among which 9 are derived from the effect of purely left-handed neutrinos, and the other 4 are from the effect of purely right-handed neutrinos. We find that the benchmark points BP4, BP6, BP9, BP11, and BP13 can significantly increase the values of these distributions while the BP3 causes a sharp decrease in these distributions. The end-point behavior of the differential distribution $d\Gamma/dE_\pi$ can be used to disentangle the effects of left-handed and right-handed neutrinos. Finally, in order to eliminate the uncertainties brought by the CKM matrix element $V_{cb}$ and the decay constant $f_{B_c}$, we introduce the normalized distributions $d\Gamma/(\Gamma dE_a)$ ($a=\pi,\rho,\mu,e$), which are only sensitive to the right-handed neutrinos. We find that in each normalized distribution there exists a fixed point that is not related to any dimension-six effective operators considered in this work.</p>

<p>2024-07-28, <strong>Fermion Masses and Mixings in String Theory with Dirac Neutrinos</strong>, Mudassar Sabir et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19458v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.19458v1</a></p>

<p>We examine the most realistic class of models among the 33 candidates in the complete landscape of supersymmetric Pati-Salam models arising from intersecting D6-branes on a $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold in type IIA string theory. The class is characterized by twelve Higgs from the $\mathcal{N}=2$ sector that precisely account for the Standard Model fermion masses and mixings without Wilson fluxes. Notably, there is a natural prediction of Dirac neutrino-masses with normal ordering $(50.4,~10.5,~6.1)$~meV consistent with both experimental constraints and swampland bounds.</p>

<p>2024-07-29, <strong>Combined constraints for scalars and pseudoscalars from $\left(g-2\right)_l$ and $e^+e^-$ colliders</strong>, Aleksandr Pustyntsev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20202v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.20202v1</a></p>

<p>Scalars and pseudoscalars with masses in the MeV to GeV range are of interest in different extensions of the Standard Model. Such particles are often associated with dark matter, the strong CP problem and the $\left(g-2\right)_{\mu}$ anomaly. In this work we investigate limits for masses of such particles and their couplings to photons and leptons which can be derived from present and future $e^+e^-$ collider experiments and current $\left(g-2\right)_{l}$ measurements. Our work expands upon previous studies in several ways, demonstrating that the interplay of both couplings is a decisive factor in this type of analyses.</p>

<p>2024-07-29, <strong>Irreducible cosmological backgrounds of a real scalar with a broken symmetry</strong>, Francesco DâEramo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19997v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.19997v1</a></p>

<p>We explore the irreducible cosmological implications of a singlet real scalar field. Our focus is on theories with an approximate and spontaneously broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry where quasi-stable domain walls can form at early times. This seemingly simple framework bears a wealth of phenomenological implications that can be tackled by means of different cosmological and astrophysical probes. We elucidate the connection between domain wall dynamics and the production of dark matter and gravitational waves. In particular, we identify three main benchmark scenarios. The gravitational wave signal observed by pulsar timing arrays can be generated by the domain walls if the mass of the singlet is $m_s \sim\,$PeV. For lower masses, but with $m_s \gtrsim 10\,$GeV, scalars produced in the annihilation of the domain walls can be dark matter with a distinctive feature in their power spectrum. Finally, the thermal bath provides an unavoidable source of unstable scalars via the freeze-in mechanism whose subsequent decays can be tested by their imprints on cosmological and terrestrial observables.</p>

<p>2024-07-29, <strong>Euclid preparation. Exploring the properties of proto-clusters in the Simulated Euclid Wide Survey</strong>, Euclid Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19919v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.19919v1</a></p>

<p>Galaxy proto-clusters are receiving an increased interest since most of the processes shaping the structure of clusters of galaxies and their galaxy population are happening at early stages of their formation. The Euclid Survey will provide a unique opportunity to discover a large number of proto-clusters over a large fraction of the sky (14 500 square degrees). In this paper, we explore the expected observational properties of proto-clusters in the Euclid Wide Survey by means of theoretical models and simulations. We provide an overview of the predicted proto-cluster extent, galaxy density profiles, mass-richness relations, abundance, and sky-filling as a function of redshift. Useful analytical approximations for the functions of these properties are provided. The focus is on the redshift range z= 1.5 to 4. We discuss in particular the density contrast with which proto-clusters can be observed against the background in the galaxy distribution if photometric galaxy redshifts are used as supplied by the ESA Euclid mission together with the ground-based photometric surveys. We show that the obtainable detection significance is sufficient to find large numbers of interesting proto-cluster candidates. For quantitative studies, additional spectroscopic follow-up is required to confirm the proto-clusters and establish their richness.</p>

<p>2024-07-29, <strong>Search for QCD axion dark matter with transmon qubits and quantum circuit</strong>, Shion Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19755v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.19755v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a direct axion dark matter (DM) search using superconducting transmon qubits as quantum sensors. With an external magnetic field applied, axion DM generates an oscillating electric field which causes the excitation of the qubit; such an excitation can be regarded as a signal of the axion DM. We provide a theoretical consideration of the excitation process of the qubits taking into account the effects of the shielding cavity surrounding the qubits and estimate the signal rate for the axion DM detection. We also discuss the enhancement of the DM signal by using cavity resonance and entangled quantum sensors realized by a quantum circuit. Combining these two effects, we can reach the parameter region suggested by QCD axion models.</p>

<p>2024-07-28, <strong>Constraints on the fuzzy dark matter mass window from high-redshift observables</strong>, Hovav Lazare et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19549v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.19549v1</a></p>

<p>We use a combination of high-redshift observables to extract the strongest constraints to date on the fraction of axion fuzzy dark matter (FDM) in the mass window $10^{-26}\,\mathrm{eV}!\lesssim! m_\mathrm{FDM}!\lesssim!10^{-23}\,\mathrm{eV}$. These observables include ultraviolet luminosity functions (UVLFs) at redshifts $4-10$ measured by the Hubble Space Telescope, a constraint on the neutral hydrogen fraction from high-redshift quasar spectroscopy, the cosmic microwave background optical depth to reionization measurement from Planck and upper bounds on the 21cm power spectrum from HERA. In order to calculate these signals for FDM cosmology, we use the 21cmFirstCLASS code to interface between AxiCLASS and 21cmFAST and consistently account for the full cosmic history from recombination to reionization. To facilitate a full Bayesian likelihood analysis, we developed a machine-learning based pipeline, which is both accurate, and enables a swift statistical inference, orders of magnitude faster than a brute force approach. We find that FDM of mass $m_\mathrm{FDM} != !10^{-23} \, \mathrm{eV}$ is bound to less than $16\%$ of the total dark matter, where the constrains strengthen towards smaller masses, reaching down to $1\%$ for $m_\mathrm{FDM}! =! 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{eV}$, both at $95\%$ confidence level. In addition, we forecast that a future detection of the 21cm power spectrum with HERA will lower the upper bound at $m_\mathrm{FDM}! =! 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{eV}$ to $\lesssim!1\%$.</p>

<p>2024-07-28, <strong>Ultra-light dark matter with non-canonical kinetics reopening the mass window</strong>, Shiyun Lu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19521v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.19521v1</a></p>

<p>Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) with mass around $10^{-22}$ eV is viewed as a promising paradigm in understanding the structure formation of the local universe at small scales. Recent observations, however, begin to challenge FDM in return. We focus on the arguments between the solution to CDM small-scale curiosities and recent observations on matter power spectrum, and find its implication on an earlier formation of small-scale structure. In this article, we propose a scheme of k-ULDM scalar field with a differently-evolving sound speed, thanks to the non-canonical kinetics. With the help of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) theory, we illustrate to change the behavior of the quantum pressure term countering collapse, therefore change the history of structure growth. We find that it can truly reopen the ULDM mass window closed by the Lyman-$\alpha$ problem. We will discuss such examples in this paper, while more possibilities remain to be explored.</p>

<h1 id="supernova-1">supernova (1)</h1>

<p>2024-07-28, <strong>Type Ia Supernovae From The First Generation Stars</strong>, Zhenwei Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19357v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.19357v1</a></p>

<p>Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered at redshift $z\lesssim2.5$ are presumed to be produced from Population (Pop) I/II stars. {In this work, we investigate the production of SNe Ia from Pop III binaries in the cosmological framework. We derive the SN Ia rate as a function of redshift under a theoretical context for the production of first generation stars and emanate the likelihood of their detection by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).} {Assuming the initial stellar mass function (IMF) favors low-mass stars as from recent numerical simulations, we found Pop III stars may give rise to a considerable amount of SNe Ia at high redshift and Pop III stars may even be the dominant SN Ia producer at z $\gtrsim 6$.} {In an optimistic scenario, we expect $\sim 1(2)$ SNe Ia from Pop III stars at $z\approx 4(5)$ for a survey of area $300 \;\rm arcmin^2$ during a $3\;\rm yr$ period with JWST. The same survey may record more than $\sim 400$ SNe Ia at lower redshift ($z\lesssim 2.5$) but with only about one of them from Pop III progenitors. There will be $\sim 6$ Pop III SNe Ia in the same field of view at redshifts of $5-10$.} Observational constraints on SN Ia rates at the redshift range of $5-10$ can place crucial constraints on the IMF of Pop III stars.</p>
