<p>2023-10-05, <strong>Singlet-doublet fermion dark matter with Dirac neutrino mass, $(g-2)<em>μ$ and $ΔN</em>{\rm eff}$</strong>, Debasish Borah et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03721v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03721v1</a></p>

<p>We study the possibility of generating light Dirac neutrino mass via scotogenic mechanism where singlet-doublet fermion dark matter (DM) plays non-trivial role in generating one-loop neutrino mass, anomalous magnetic moment of muon $(g-2)_\mu$ as well as additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta{N_{\rm eff}}$ within reach of cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We show that the Dirac nature of neutrinos can bring interesting correlations within the parameter space satisfying the $\left(g-2\right)_\mu$ anomaly and DM relic density and the effective relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta{N_{\rm eff}}$. While we stick to thermal singlet doublet DM with promising detection prospects, both thermal and non-thermal origin of $\Delta{N_{\rm eff}}$ have been explored. In addition to detection prospects at DM, $(g-2)$ and other particle physics experiments, the model remains verifiable at future CMB experiments like CMB-S4, SPT-3G.</p>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>Varying Entropy Degrees of Freedom Effects in Low-Scale Leptogenesis</strong>, Dimitrios Karamitros et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03703v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03703v1</a></p>

<p>We analyse in detail the effect of varying entropy degrees of freedom on low-scale leptogenesis models. As an archetypal model, we consider the Tri-Resonant Leptogensis${}$ (TRL) scenario introduced recently by the authors, where the neutrino-Yukawa coupling matrix is dictated by an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_n$ discrete symmetry (with $n=3,6$). TRL models exhibit no preferred direction in the leptonic flavour space and have the remarkable feature that leptogenesis can successfully take place even if all light neutrinos are strictly massless up to one-loop order. Most interestingly, for TRL scenarios with heavy Majorana neutrinos lighter than 100 GeV, temperature varying degrees of freedom associated with the entropy of the plasma have a dramatic impact on the predictions of the Baryon Asymmetry in the Universe (BAU), and sensitively depend on the freeze-out sphaleron temperature $T_{\rm sph}$. We find that this is a generic feature of most freeze-out low-scale leptogenesis models discussed in the literature. In the same context, we consider heavy-neutrino scenarios realising dynamics related to critical unstable qudits in the thermal plasma and assess their significance in generating the BAU. The phenomenological implications of TRL scenarios at the intensity and high-energy frontiers are analysed.</p>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>Hadronic processes at work in 5BZB J0630-2406</strong>, Gaëtan Fichet de Clairfontaine et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03698v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03698v1</a></p>

<p>Recent observations are shedding light on the important role that active galactic nuclei (AGN) play in the production of high-energy neutrinos. In this study, we focus on one object, 5BZB J0630-2406, which is among the blazars recently proposed as associated with neutrino emission during the first 7-yr IceCube observations. Modelling the quasi-simultaneous, broad-band spectral energy distribution, we explore various scenarios from purely leptonic to lepto-hadronic models, testing the inclusion of external photon fields. This theoretical study provides a complementary testing ground for the proposed neutrino-blazar association. Despite being historically classified as a BL Lac, our study shows that 5BZB J0630-2406 belongs to the relatively rare sub-class of high-power flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Our results indicate that interactions between protons and external radiation fields can produce a neutrino flux that is within the reach of the IceCube detector. Furthermore, the spectral shape of the X-ray emission suggests the imprint of hadronic processes related to very energetic protons.</p>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>Track-Like Event Analysis at the Baikal-GVD Neutrino Telescope</strong>, V. M. Aynutdinov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03450v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03450v1</a></p>

<p>Reconstructed tracks of muons produced in neutrino interactions provide the precise probe for the neutrino direction. Therefore, track-like events are a powerful tool to search for neutrino point sources. Recently, Baikal-GVD has demonstrated the first sample of low-energy neutrino candidate events extracted from the data of the season 2019 in a so-called single-cluster analysis - treating each cluster as an independent detector. In this paper, the extension of the track-like event analysis to a wider data set is discussed and the first high-energy track-like events are demonstrated. The status of multi-cluster track reconstruction and that of the event analysis are also discussed.</p>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>Macroscopic quantum-mechanical scattering</strong>, Marian Apostol et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03315v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03315v1</a></p>

<p>In certain conditions a macroscopic quantum-mechanical scattering may occur, which may lead to a coherent cross-section on a macroscopic scale in a monocrystal. The conditions are satisfied by neutrinos, but not satisfied by other projectiles, with a higher cross-section. This may explain Weber-type experiments of neutrino detection by a perfect, stiff sapphire monocrystal. The occurrence of coherence domains for quantum-mechanical scattering and classical diffraction is analyzed, and the force exerted upon a macroscopic target is estimated. It is concluded that neutrinos exhibit a distinctive feature in this respect, due precisely to their very small cross-section.</p>

<h1 id="dark-matter-3">dark matter (3)</h1>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>Relic density of asymmetric dark matter and constraints on the parameter spaces</strong>, Qiu Sujuan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03711v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03711v1</a></p>

<p>Based on the cosmological observations, the baryon and dark matter energy densities are similar. There may exist an asymmetry between the dark matter particles and their corresponding anti–particles. We review the relic density of asymmetric dark matter particle and anti–particle in the standard cosmological scenario and quintessence model with kination phase. Then we use the Planck data to find constraints on the annihilation cross section and the mass of the asymmetric dark matter in those models.</p>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>The Right-Handed Slepton Bulk Region for Dark Matter in Generalized No-scale $\mathcal{F}$-$SU(5)$ with Effective Super-Natural Supersymmetry</strong>, Tianjun Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03622v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03622v1</a></p>

<p>We propose Generalized No-Scale Supergravity, the simplest scenario for Effective Super-Natural Supersymmetry, naturally solving the supersymmetry electroweak fine-tuning problem and including natural dark matter. A light right-handed slepton bulk region is realized in $\mathcal{F}$-$SU(5)$ and the pMSSM. Though beyond the LHC reach, the bulk can be probed at the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee), Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), and Hyper-Kamiokande.</p>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>The Intracluster Light and its Link with the Dynamical State of the Host Group/Cluster: the Role of the Halo Concentration</strong>, E. Contini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03263v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03263v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate on the role of the halo concentration in the formation of the intra-cluster light (ICL) in galaxy groups and clusters, as predicted by a state-of-art semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, coupled with a set of high-resolution dark matter only simulations. The analysis focuses on how the fraction of ICL correlates with halo mass, concentration and fraction of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in a large sample of groups and clusters with $13.0\leq \log M_{halo} \leq 15.0$. The fraction of ICL follows a normal distribution, a consequence of the stochastic nature of the physical processes responsible for the formation of the diffuse light. The fractional budget of ICL depends on both halo mass (very weakly) until group scales, and concentration (remarkably). More interestingly, the ICL fraction is higher in more concentrated objects, a result of the stronger tidal forces acting in the innermost regions of the haloes where the concentration is the quantity playing the most relevant role. Our model predictions do not show any dependence between the ICL and ETGs fractions and so, we instead suggest the concentration rather than the mass, as recently claimed, to be the main driver of the ICL formation. The diffuse light starts to form in groups via stellar stripping and mergers and later assembled in more massive objects. However, the formation and assembly keep going on group/cluster scales at lower redshift through the same processes, mainly via stellar stripping in the vicinity of the central regions where tidal forces are stronger.</p>

<h1 id="supernova-4">supernova (4)</h1>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>Exploring the Hubble Tension: A Novel Approach through Cosmological Observations</strong>, Darshan Kumar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03509v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03509v1</a></p>

<p>The simplest cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM) is well-known to suffer from the Hubble tension, namely an almost $5 \sigma$ discrepancy between the (model-based) early-time determination of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and its late-time (and model-independent) determination. To circumvent this, we introduce an additional energy source that varies with the redshift as $(1 + z)^n$, where $0 &lt; n &lt; 3$, and test it against the Pantheon Compilation of Type Ia Supernovae as well as the CMBR observations (at $z \approx 1100$). The deduced $H_0$ is now well-consistent with the value obtained from local observations of Cepheid variables. Suggesting a non-zero value for the curvature density parameter, positive (negative) for $n &gt; 2$ ($n &lt; 2$), the resolution is also consistent with the BAO data.</p>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>Serendipitous detection of the dusty Type IIL SN 1980K with JWST/MIRI</strong>, Szanna Zsíros et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03448v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03448v1</a></p>

<p>We present mid-infrared (mid-IR) imaging of the Type IIL supernova (SN) 1980K with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) more than 40 yr post-explosion. SN 1980K, located in the nearby ($D\approx7$ Mpc) “SN factory” galaxy NGC 6946, was serendipitously captured in JWST/MIRI images taken of the field of SN 2004et in the same galaxy. SN 1980K serves as a promising candidate for studying the transitional phase between young SNe and older SN remnants and also provides a great opportunity to investigate its the close environment. SN 1980K can be identified as a clear and bright point source in all eight MIRI filters from F560W up to F2550W. We fit analytical dust models to the mid-IR spectral energy distribution that reveal a large amount ($M_d \approx 0.002 {M}_{\odot}$) of Si-dominated dust at $T_{dust}\approx 150$ K (accompanied by a hotter dust/gas component), and also computed numerical SED dust models. Radiative transfer modeling of a late-time optical spectrum obtained recently with Keck discloses that an even larger ($\sim 0.24-0.58~{M}_{\odot}$) amount of dust is needed in order for selective extinction to explain the asymmetric line profile shapes observed in SN 1980K. As a conclusion, with JWST, we may see i) pre-existing circumstellar dust heated collisionally (or, partly radiatively), analogous to the equatorial ring of SN 1987A, or ii) the mid-IR component of the presumed newly-formed dust, accompanied by much more colder dust present in the ejecta (as suggested by the late-time the optical spectra).</p>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>G189.6+03.3: the first complete X-ray view provided by SRG/eROSITA</strong>, Francesco Camilloni et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03426v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03426v1</a></p>

<p>Context. G189.6+03.3 and IC443 are two examples of supernova remnants located in a region rich of gas and dust, spatially close to the HII region S249. So far, the actual shape of IC443 is believed to be given by the past action of multiple supernova explosions, while a third unrelated might have originated G189.6+03.3.   Aims. If the IC443 nebula has been extensively observed in several bands, in opposite there is an almost complete lack of observations on the nearby and much weaker supernova remnant G189.6+03.3, discovered in 1994 with ROSAT. Given the relatively large extent of this second remnant, the new dataset provided by the X-ray telescope eROSITA onboard the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) mission gives a unique opportunity to characterize it more in depth.   Methods. We provide a full spectral characterization of G189.6+03.3 emission for the first time, together with new images covering the whole remnant. Since one of the leading hypothesis is that its emission partially overlaps with the emission of IC443, we test this scenario dividing the remnant in several regions from which we extracted the spectra.   Results. The new X-ray images provided by eROSITA show an elongated structure. Together with the detection of supersolar abundances of O, Mg, Ne and Si and subsolar abundance of Fe, these features could be an indication of a faint supernova explosion. The X-ray spectra also highlight the presence of a 0.7 keV plasma component across all the regions together with a column density almost uniform.   Conclusions. The ubiquitous presence of the 0.7 keV plasma component is a strong indication for G189.6+03.3 overlapping completely with IC443. We propose the progenitors of G189.6+03.3 and IC443 could have been hosted in a binary or multiple system, originating two explosions at different times in different positions.</p>

<p>2023-10-05, <strong>Potential of the Cherenkov Telescope Array for studying the young nearby supernova remnants</strong>, Dmitry Prokhorov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03280v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.03280v1</a></p>

<p>Modern imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes have extensively observed young nearby supernova remnants (SNRs), with ages of about 1000 years or less, in the very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray band. These efforts resulted in the detection of VHE emission from three young SNRs - Cassiopeia A, Tycho, and SN 1006 - and provided significant evidence for emission from the more distant Kepler’s SNR. However, many questions on the production of VHE gamma rays in these remnants remain unanswered. Using detailed physical models for Tycho’s SNR based on the CR-hydro-NEI code and physically motivated models for the other young nearby remnants, we simulated observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) of these gamma-ray sources. We highlight properties of these remnants accessible for investigation with future CTA observations and discuss which questions are expected to be answered.</p>
