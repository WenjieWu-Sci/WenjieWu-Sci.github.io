<p>2024-03-13, <strong>Axi-majoron for almost everything</strong>, Gabriela Barenboim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08675v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.08675v1</a></p>

<p>The details of the minimal cosmological standard model (MCSM) proposed in Ref. [1] are discussed. The model is based on the scale-symmetry and the global Peccei-Quinn(PQ) symmetry with a key assumption that the latter is broken only in the gravity sector in a scale-invariant manner. We show that the model provides a quite simple unified framework for the unknown history of the universe from inflation to the epoch of big-bang nucleosynthesis, simultaneously addressing key puzzles of high energy theory and cosmology: (i) the origin of scales, (ii) primordial inflation, (iii) matter-antimatter asymmetry, (iv) tiny neutrino masses, (v) dark matter, and (vi) the strong CP-problem. Scale symmetry can be exact, and the Planck scale is dynamically generated. The presence of Gauss-Bonnet term may safely retain dangerous non-perturbative symmetry-breaking effects negligible, allowing large-field trans-Planckian inflation along the PQ-field. Iso-curvature perturbations of axi-majorons are suppressed. A sizable amount of PQ-number asymmetry is generated at the end of inflation, and conserved afterwards. Domain wall problem is absent due to the PQ-number asymmetry. Baryogenesis can be realized by either inflationary Affleck-Dine mechanism or spontaneous leptogenesis thanks to the PQ-number asymmetry, or by resonant leptogenesis. Dark matter can be purely cold axi-majorons from the mis-alignment contribution only with the symmetry-breaking scale of $\mathcal{O}(10^{12}) {\rm GeV}$. Hot axi-majorons from the decay of the inflaton become a natural source for a sizable amount of dark radiation. Inflationary gravitational waves are expected to have information about some masse parameters of the left-handed and the right-handed neutrinos, thanks to the presence of an early matter-domination era driven by at least a long-lived right-handed neutrino species.</p>

<p>2024-03-13, <strong>Measurements of the charge ratio and polarization of cosmic-ray muons with the Super-Kamiokande detector</strong>, H. Kitagawa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08619v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.08619v1</a></p>

<p>We present the results of the charge ratio ($R$) and polarization ($P^{\mu}_{0}$) measurements using the decay electron events collected from 2008 September to 2022 June by the Super-Kamiokande detector. Because of its underground location and long operation, we performed high precision measurements by accumulating cosmic-ray muons. We measured the muon charge ratio to be $R=1.32 \pm 0.02$ $(\mathrm{stat.}{+}\mathrm{syst.})$ at $E_{\mu}\cos \theta_{\mathrm{Zenith}}=0.7^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ $\mathrm{TeV}$, where $E_{\mu}$ is the muon energy and $\theta_{\mathrm{Zenith}}$ is the zenith angle of incoming cosmic-ray muons. This result is consistent with the Honda flux model while this suggests a tension with the $\pi K$ model of $1.9\sigma$. We also measured the muon polarization at the production location to be $P^{\mu}_{0}=0.52 \pm 0.02$ $(\mathrm{stat.}{+}\mathrm{syst.})$ at the muon momentum of $0.9^{+0.6}_{-0.1}$ $\mathrm{TeV}/c$ at the surface of the mountain; this also suggests a tension with the Honda flux model of $1.5\sigma$. This is the most precise measurement ever to experimentally determine the cosmic-ray muon polarization near $1~\mathrm{TeV}/c$. These measurement results are useful to improve the atmospheric neutrino simulations.</p>

<p>2024-03-13, <strong>Comparing jet-shaped point symmetry in cluster cooling flows and supernovae</strong>, Noam Soker et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08544v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.08544v1</a></p>

<p>I point out similarities between point-symmetric X-ray morphologies in cooling flow groups and clusters of galaxies, which are observed to be shaped by jets, and point-symmetric morphologies of eight core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants. I use these similarities to strengthen the jittering jet explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe, which predicts that the last pairs of jets to be launched by the newly born neutron star might shape some CCSN remnants to point-symmetric morphology. The point-symmetric morphologies in both types of objects are composed of two or more pairs of opposite bubbles (cavities), nozzles, some clumps, small protrusions (termed ears), and rims. The typically large volume of a CCSN remnant shaped by jets implies that the shaping jets carry an energy comparable to that of the ejecta, which in turn implies that jets exploded the remnant’s massive star progenitor. The morphological similarities studied here add to the similarity of CCSN remnants, not only point-symmetric ones, to planetary nebulae shaped by jets. Together, these similarities solidify the JJEM as the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe. I consider the identification of point-symmetry in CCSNe, as expected by jet-shaping in the JJEM, to be the most severe challenge to the competing neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. I reiterate my earlier claim, but in a more vocal voice, that the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe is the JJEM.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Final state radiation from high and ultrahigh energy neutrino interactions</strong>, Ryan Plestid et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07984v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07984v1</a></p>

<p>Charged leptons produced by high-energy and ultrahigh-energy neutrinos have a substantial probability of emitting prompt internal bremsstrahlung $\nu_\ell + N \rightarrow \ell + X + \gamma$. This can have important consequences for neutrino detection. We discuss observable consequences at high- and ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes and LHC’s Forward Physics Facility. Logarithmic enhancements can be substantial (e.g.\ $\sim 20\%$) when either the charged lepton’s energy, or the rest of the cascade, is measured. We comment on applications involving the inelasticity distribution including measurements of the $\nu/\bar{\nu}$ flux ratio, throughgoing muons, and double-bang signatures for high-energy neutrino observation. Furthermore, for ultrahigh-energy neutrino observation, we find that final state radiation affects flavor measurements and decreases the energy of both Earth-emergent tau leptons and regenerated tau neutrinos. Finally, for LHC’s Forward Physics Facility, we find that final state radiation will impact future extractions of strange quark parton distribution functions. Final state radiation should be included in future analyses at neutrino telescopes and the Forward Physics Facility.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Complete Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model File</strong>, Jonathan Kriewald et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07756v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07756v1</a></p>

<p>We develop a comprehensive implementation of the minimal Left-Right symmetric model within a FeynRules model file. We derive the complete set of mass spectra and mixings for the charged and neutral gauge bosons, would-be-Goldstones and gauge fixing, together with the ghost Lagrangian. In the scalar sector, we analytically re-derive all the massive states with mixings and devise a physical input scheme, which expresses the model couplings in terms of masses and mixing angles of all states. Fermion couplings are determined in closed form, including the Dirac mixing in the neutrino sector, evaluated explicitly with the Cayley-Hamilton method. We calculate the one loop next-to-leading QCD corrections and provide a complete UFO file for NLO studies, demonstrated on relevant benchmarks. We provide various restricted variants of the model file with different gauges, massless states, neutrino hierarchies and parity violating $g_L \neq g_R$ gauge couplings.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Identifying a point-symmetric morphology in supernova remnant Cassiopeia A: explosion by jittering jets</strong>, Ealeal Bear et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07625v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07625v1</a></p>

<p>We identify a point-symmetric morphology of the supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A compatible with shaping by at least two, and more likely more than four, pairs of opposite jets, as expected in the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of core-collapse supernovae. Using an old X-ray map of argon, we identify seven pairs of opposite morphological features that we connect with lines that cross each other at the same point on the plane of the sky. The opposite morphological features include protrusions, clumps, filaments, and funnels in the main SNR shell. In addition to these seven symmetry axes, we find two tentative symmetry axes (lines). These lines form a point-symmetric wind-rose. We place this point-symmetric wind-rose on a new JWST and X-ray images of Cassiopeia A. We find other morphological features and one more symmetry axis that strengthen the identified point-symmetric morphology. Not all symmetry axes correspond to jets; e.g., some clumps are formed by the compression of ejecta between two jet-inflated lobes (bubbles). The robust point-symmetric morphology in the iconic Cassiopeia A SNR strongly supports the JJEM and poses a severe challenge to the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Validation of electrodeposited 241Am alpha-particle sources for use in liquified gas detectors at cryogenic temperatures</strong>, E. Calvo Alamillo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07539v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07539v1</a></p>

<p>This paper describes a procedure for the validation of alpha-particle sources (exempt unsealed sources) to be used in experimental setups with liquefied gases at cryogenic temperatures (down to -196 C) and high vacuum. These setups are of interest for the development and characterization of neutrino and dark matter detectors based on liquid argon, among others. Due to the high purity requirements, the sources have to withstand high vacuum and cryogenic temperatures for extended periods. The validation procedure has been applied to 241Am sources produced by electrodeposition.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Search for CP-violating Neutrino Non-Standard Interactions with the NOvA Experiment</strong>, NOvA Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07266v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07266v1</a></p>

<p>This Letter reports a search for charge-parity (CP) symmetry violating non-standard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with matter using the NOvA Experiment, and examines their effects on the determination of the standard oscillation parameters. Data from $\nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})\rightarrow\nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})$ and $\nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})\rightarrow\nu_{e}(\bar{\nu}_{e})$ oscillation channels are used to measure the effect of the NSI parameters $\varepsilon_{e\mu}$ and $\varepsilon_{e\tau}$. With 90% C.L. the magnitudes of the NSI couplings are constrained to be $|\varepsilon_{e\mu}| \, \lesssim 0.3$ and $|\varepsilon_{e\tau}| \, \lesssim 0.4$. A degeneracy at $|\varepsilon_{e\tau}| \, \approx 1.8$ is reported, and we observe that the presence of NSI limits sensitivity to the standard CP phase $\delta_{\tiny\text{CP}}$.</p>

<p>2024-03-13, <strong>Observational tests in scale invariance I: galaxy clusters and rotation of galaxies</strong>, Andre Maeder et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08759v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.08759v1</a></p>

<p>Galaxy velocities in clusters, rotation curves of galaxies, and “vertical” oscillations in the Milky Way currently show too high velocities with respect to the masses thought to be involved. While these velocity excesses are currently interpreted as the consequence of dark matter, it can also be naturally explained as a consequence of scale invariant theory, which rests on a very simple first principle: the addition of a new fundamental symmetry. In the present work, the case of scale invariance, present in General Relativity and Maxwell equations for the empty space without charge and current, is considered. Cosmological models predict a rapid decrease of these effects with increasing mean density up to the critical density, where they totally disappear. Starting from the scale invariant geodesic equation by Dirac (1973), for which a demonstration by an action principle is presented, a modified Newton equation is derived. The solutions of this equation are applied to clusters of galaxies, galactic rotation at different redshifts and “vertical” motions in the Milky Way. In this new framework, the convergence of theoretical predictions and observations, in different gravitational systems, epochs, mass range and spatial scales, opens interesting perspectives that deserve to be explored further.</p>

<p>2024-03-13, <strong>Interpreting 95 GeV di-photon/$b\bar{b}$ excesses as a lightest Higgs boson of the MRSSM</strong>, Jan Kalinowski et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08720v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.08720v1</a></p>

<p>The Minimal R-symmetric Supersymmetric Standard Model (MRSSM) is a well motivated BSM model which can accommodate the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson in agreement with electroweak precision observables, in particular with the $W$ boson mass and $T$ parameter. In the 2016 paper we showed that the SM-like 125 GeV Higgs state can be also realised as the second-to-lightest scalar of the MRSSM, leaving room for another sub-100 GeV state. Motivated by the recent ATLAS and CMS observation of the di-photon excess at a mass of around 95 GeV we investigate the possibility whether this could be the lightest CP-even MRSSM scalar in a variation of our benchmarks presented in the 2016 work. We show that such a state can also simultaneously explain the excess in the $b\bar{b}$ final state observed around the same mass value at LEP. Due to the R-symmetric nature of the model, a light singlet-like Higgs state leads necessarily to a light bino-singlino Dirac dark matter candidate, which can give a correct relic density while evading current experimental bounds. Dark matter and LHC searches place further bounds on this scenario and point to parameter regions which are viable and of interest for the LHC Run III and upcoming dark matter experiments.</p>

<p>2024-03-13, <strong>A too-many dwarf galaxy satellites problem in the M83 group</strong>, Oliver Müller et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08717v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.08717v1</a></p>

<p>Dwarf galaxies in groups of galaxies provide excellent test cases for models of structure formation. This led to a so-called small-scale crisis, including the famous missing satellite and too-big-to-fail problems. It was suggested that these two problems are solved by the introduction of baryonic physics in cosmological simulations. We test for the nearby grand spiral M83 - a Milky Way sibling - whether its number of dwarf galaxy companions is compatible with today’s $\Lambda$ + Cold Dark Matter model using two methods: with cosmological simulations that include baryons, as well as with theoretical predictions from the sub-halo mass function. By employing distance measurements we recover a list of confirmed dwarf galaxies within 330 kpc around M83 down to a magnitude of $M_V =-10$. We found that both the state-of-the-art hydrodynamical cosmological simulation Illustris-TNG50 and theoretical predictions agree with the number of confirmed satellites around M83 at the bright end of the luminosity function (&gt;10$^8$ solar masses) but underestimate it at the faint end (down to 10$^6$ solar masses) at more than 3$\sigma$ and 5$\sigma$ levels, respectively. This indicates a too-many satellites problem in $\Lambda$CDM for M83. The actual degree of tension to cosmological models is underestimated, because the number of observed satellites is incomplete due to the high contamination of spurious stars and galactic cirrus.</p>

<p>2024-03-13, <strong>The neutron decay anomaly, neutron stars and dark matter</strong>, Mar Bastero-Gil et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08666v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.08666v1</a></p>

<p>The discrepancies in different measurements of the lifetime of isolated neutrons could be resolved by considering an extra neutron decay channel into dark matter, with a branching ratio of the order of $O(1$\%). Although the decay channel into a dark fermion $\chi$ plus visible matter has been already experimentally excluded, a dark decay with either a scalar or dark photon remains still a possibility. In particular, a model with a fermion mass $m_\chi\approx 1$ GeV and a scalar $m_\phi \approx O(\rm{MeV})$ could provide not only the required branching ratio to explain the anomaly but also a good dark matter (DM) candidate with the right thermal abundance today. Although the interaction DM-neutron will affect the formation of neutron stars, the combined effect of the dark matter self-interactions mediated by the light scalar and an effective repulsive interaction with the neutrons induced by the scalar-Higgs coupling would allow heavy enough neutron stars. The combined constraints from neutron lifetime, dark matter abundance, neutron star and Higgs physics, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, restrict the light scalar mass to the range $2 m_e &lt; m_\phi &lt; 2 m_e + 0.0375$ MeV.</p>

<p>2024-03-13, <strong>Evolution of cold streams in hot gaseous halos</strong>, WenSheng Hong et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08631v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.08631v1</a></p>

<p>In the prevailing model of galaxy formation and evolution, the process of gas accretion onto central galaxies undergoes a transition from cold-dominated to hot-dominated modes. This shift occurs when the mass of the parent dark matter halos exceeds a critical threshold known as $M_{shock}$. Moreover, cold gas usually flows onto central galaxies through filamentary structures, currently referred to as cold streams. However, the evolution of cold streams in halos with masses around $M_{shock}$, particularly how they are disrupted, remains unclear. To address this issue, we conduct a set of idealised hydrodynamic simulations. Our simulations show that (1) for a gas metallicity $Z=0.001-0.1Z_{\odot}$, cold stream with an inflow rate $\sim 3\, \rm{M_{\odot}}/yr$ per each can persist and effectively transport cold and cool gas to the central region ($&lt; 0.2$ virial radius) in halos with mass $10^{12}\, \rm{M_{\odot}}$, but is disrupted at a radius around $0.2$ virial radius due to compression heating for halos with mass $3 \times 10^{12}\, \rm{M_{\odot}}$. (2) At $z\sim 2$, the maximum halo mass that capable of hosting and sustaining cold streams $M_{stream}$ is between $1\times 10^{12} \rm{M_{\odot}}$ and $1.5\times 10^{12}\rm{M_{\odot}}$ for gas metallicity $Z=0.001Z_{\odot}$, while for a higher gas metallicity $Z=0.1Z_{\odot}$, this value increases to $\sim 1.5\times 10^{12}\rm{M_{\odot}}$. (3) The evolution and ultimate fate of cold streams are determined primarily by the rivalry between radiative cooling and compression. Stronger heating due to compression in halos more massive than $M_{stream}$ can surpass cooling and heat the gas in cold streams to the hot ($\geq 10^6\,$ K) phase.</p>

<p>2024-03-13, <strong>Search for cosmic-ray boosted sub-MeV dark matter-electron scatterings in PandaX-4T</strong>, Xiaofeng Shang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08361v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.08361v1</a></p>

<p>We report the first search for the elastic scatterings between cosmic-ray boosted sub-MeV dark matter and electrons in the PandaX-4T liquid xenon experiment. Sub-MeV dark matter particles can be accelerated by scattering with electrons in the cosmic rays and produce detectable electron recoil signals in the detector. Using the commissioning data from PandaX-4T of 0.63~tonne$\cdot$year exposure, we set new constraints on DM-electron scattering cross sections for DM masses ranging from 10~eV/$c^2$ to 3~keV/$c^2$.</p>

<p>2024-03-13, <strong>Generic autonomous system approach to interacting dark energy models</strong>, Parth Shah et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08263v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.08263v1</a></p>

<p>We explore an autonomous system analysis of dark energy models with interactions between dark energy and cold dark matter in a general systematic approach to cosmological fluids. We investigate two types of models such as local and non-local ones. In particular, a local form of interaction is directly proportional to only the energy density, while a non-local interaction is directly proportional to the energy density as well as the Hubble parameter. As a consequence, it is explicitly demonstrated that in both cases there exist the stability points in terms of cosmological parameters. This work aims at obtaining acceleration and stability using interaction models without modifying the matter or geometric component of the Universe.</p>

<p>Evidence for the majority of the supermassive black holes in the local universe has been obtained dynamically from stellar motions with the Schwarzschild orbit superposition method. However, there have been only a handful of studies using simulated data to examine the ability of this method to reliably recover known input black hole masses $M_{BH}$ and other galaxy parameters. Here we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of the triaxial Schwarzschild method at $\textit{simultaneously}$ determining $M_{BH}$, stellar mass-to-light ratio $M^{<em>}/L$, dark matter mass, and three intrinsic triaxial shape parameters of simulated galaxies. For each of 25 rounds of mock observations using simulated stellar kinematics and the $\texttt{TriOS}$ code, we derive best-fitting parameters and confidence intervals after a full search in the 6D parameter space with our likelihood-based model inference scheme. The two key mass parameters, $M_{BH}$ and $M^{</em>}/L$, are recovered within the 68% confidence interval, and other parameters are recovered between 68% and 95% confidence intervals. The spatially varying velocity anisotropy of the stellar orbits is also well recovered. We explore whether the goodness-of-fit measure used for galaxy model selection in our pipeline is biased by variable complexity across the 6D parameter space. In our tests, adding a penalty term to the likelihood measure either makes little difference, or worsens the recovery in some cases.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>EIGER VI. The Correlation Function, Host Halo Mass and Duty Cycle of Luminous Quasars at $z\gtrsim6$</strong>, Anna-Christina Eilers et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07986v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07986v1</a></p>

<p>We expect luminous ($M_{1450}\lesssim-26.5$) high-redshift quasars to trace the highest density peaks in our universe, and therefore to reside in proto-clusters encompassing an abundance of galaxies in close vicinity. Here, we present observations of four $z\gtrsim6$ quasar fields using JWST/NIRCam in imaging and widefield slitless spectroscopy mode and report a wide range in the number of detected [OIII]-emitting galaxies in the quasars’ environments, ranging between a density enhancement of $\delta&gt;100$ within a $2$ cMpc radius - one of the largest proto-clusters during the Epoch of Reionization discovered to date - to a density contrast consistent with zero, indicating the presence of a UV-luminous quasar in a region comparable to the average density of the universe. By measuring the two-point cross-correlation function of quasars and their surrounding galaxies, as well as the galaxy auto-correlation function, we infer a correlation length of quasars at $\langle z\rangle=6.25$ of $r_0^{\rm QQ}=21.3^{+2.7}_{-2.6}~{\rm cMpc}\,h^{-1}$, while we obtain a correlation length of the [OIII]-emitting galaxies of $r_0^{\rm GG}=4.2\pm0.1~{\rm cMpc}\,h^{-1}$. By comparing the correlation functions to dark-matter-only simulations we estimate the minimum mass of the quasars’ host dark matter halos to be $\log_{10}(M_{\rm halo, min}/M_\odot)=12.30\pm0.14$ (and $\log_{10}(M_{\rm halo, min}^{\rm [OIII]}/M_\odot) = 10.72\pm0.03$ for the [OIII]-emitters), indicating that (a) luminous quasars do not necessarily reside within the most overdense regions in the early universe, and that (b) the UV-luminous duty cycle of quasar activity at these redshifts is $f_{\rm duty}\ll1$. Such short quasar activity timescales challenge our understanding of early supermassive black hole growth and provide evidence for highly dust-obscured growth phases or episodic, radiatively inefficient accretion rates.</p>

<p>Scalar-tensor theories have a long history as possible phenomenological alternatives to General Relativity, but are known to potentially produce deviations from the (strong) equivalence principle in systems involving self-gravitating objects, as a result of the presence of an additional gravitational scalar field besides the tensor modes of General Relativity. We describe here a novel mechanism whereby the equivalence principle is violated for an isolated rotating neutron star, if the gravitational scalar field is changing in time far from the system. We show that the neutron star rotational period changes due to an effective coupling (“angular momentum sensitivity”) to the gravitational scalar, and compute that coupling for viable equations of state for nuclear matter. We comment on the relevance of our findings for testing scalar-tensor theories and models of ultralight dark matter with pulsar timing observations, a topic that we tackle in a companion paper.</p>

<p>The Standard Model of particle physics describes the properties of elementary particles and their interactions remarkably well, but in particular does not account for dark matter. Isotope-shift spectroscopy is a sensitive probe of fifth forces and new particles that illuminate the dark matter sector. This method sets bounds on new bosons that couple neutrons and electrons with masses in the keV/c2 to MeV/c2 range. With increasing spectroscopic precision, such searches are limited by uncertainties of isotope masses and the understanding of nuclear structure. Here, we report on high-precision mass-ratio and isotope-shift measurements of the ytterbium isotopes $^{168,170,172,174,176}$Yb that exceed previous measurements by up to two orders of magnitude. From these measurements, we extract higher-order changes in the nuclear charge distribution along the Yb isotope chain and use these to benchmark novel ab initio calculations. Our measurements set new bounds on the existence of the proposed boson.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Models of Accidental Dark Matter with a Fundamental Scalar</strong>, Stefano Palmisano et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07759v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07759v1</a></p>

<p>We consider models of accidental dark matter, namely models in which the dark matter is a composite state that is stable thanks to an accidental symmetry of the theory. The fundamental constituents are vectorlike fermions, taken to be fragments of representations of the grand unifying gauge group $SU(5)$, as well as a scalar singlet. All the new fields are charged under a new confining gauge group, which we take to be $SU(N)$, leading to models with complex dark matter. We analyse the models in the context of $SU(5)$ grand unification with a non-standard approach recently proposed in the literature. The advantage of including the scalar mainly resides in the fact that it allows to break several undesired accidental symmetries leading to a larger set of viable models with respect to previous literature, in which only fermions (or only scalars) were considered. Moreover these models present distinct novelties, namely dark states with non-zero baryon and lepton number and the existence of composite hybrid states of fermions and scalars. We identify phenomena that are specific to the inclusion of the scalar and discuss possibilities to test this setup.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Enhanced Monochromatic Photon Emission from Millicharged Co-Interacting Dark Matter</strong>, Mingxuan Du et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07528v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07528v1</a></p>

<p>We study a millicharged co-interacting dark matter scenario, where the primary dark matter constituent is the dark photon $A’$ and the secondary component is the fermion $\chi$. In this model, $\chi$ interacts with $A’$ via a $U(1)’$ interaction while being millicharged with respect to normal photons. Our investigation focuses on the oscillation of $A’$ dark matter into photons within the background of $\chi$ particles, revealing that the $A’-\chi$ scattering rate benefits from a Bose enhancement of the $A’$ final state. As the oscillation production rate is directly linked to the scattering rate, the conversion of $A’$ dark matter into monochromatic photons experiences significant amplification owing to this Bose enhancement, especially when the scattering rate $\Gamma_{\rm sca}$ approaches the dark photon mass $m_{A’}$. These converted monochromatic photons are detectable through radio telescopes and can induce distortions in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectrum. We find that the sensitivity of radio telescopes and the constraints imposed by CMB distortion on the kinetic mixing parameter are notably heightened compared to scenarios without the subdominant millicharged dark matter.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Reheated Sub-40000 Kelvin Neutron Stars at the JWST, ELT, and TMT</strong>, Nirmal Raj et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07496v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07496v1</a></p>

<p>Neutron stars cooling passively since their birth may be reheated in their late-stage evolution by a number of possible phenomena: rotochemical, vortex creep, crust cracking, magnetic field decay, or more exotic processes such as removal of neutrons from their Fermi seas (the nucleon Auger effect), baryon number-violating nucleon decay, and accretion of particle dark matter. Using Exposure Time Calculator tools, we show that reheating mechanisms imparting effective temperatures of 2000–40000 Kelvin may be uncovered with excellent sensitivities at the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), and the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), with imaging instruments operating from visible-edge to near-infrared. With a day of exposure, they could constrain the reheating luminosity of a neutron star up to a distance of 500 pc, within which about $10^5$ (undiscovered) neutron stars lie. Detection in multiple filters could overconstrain a neutron star’s surface temperature, distance from Earth, mass, and radius. Using publicly available catalogues of newly discovered pulsars at the FAST and CHIME radio telescopes and the Galactic electron distribution models YMW16 and NE2001, we estimate the pulsars’ dispersion measure distance from Earth, and find that potentially 30$-$40 of these may be inspected for late-stage reheating within viable exposure times, in addition to a few hundred candidates already present in the ATNF catalogue. Whereas the coldest neutron star observed (PSR J2144$-$3933) has an upper limit on its effective temperature of about 33000 Kelvin with the Hubble Space Telescope, we show that the effective temperature may be constrained down to 20000 Kelvin with JWST-NIRCam, 15000 Kelvin at ELT-MICADO, and 9000 Kelvin with TMT-IRIS. Campaigns to measure thermal luminosities of old neutron stars would be transformative for astrophysics and fundamental physics.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Predicting the Scaling Relations between the Dark Matter Halo Mass and Observables from Generalised Profiles I: Kinematic Tracers</strong>, Andrew Sullivan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07352v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07352v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the relationship between a dark matter halo’s mass profile and measures of the velocity dispersion of kinematic tracers within its gravitational potential. By predicting the scaling relation of the halo mass with the aperture velocity dispersion, $M_\mathrm{vir} - \sigma_\mathrm{ap}$, we present the expected form and dependence of this halo mass tracer on physical parameters within our analytic halo model: parameterised by the halo’s negative inner logarithmic density slope, $\alpha$, its concentration parameter, $c$, and its velocity anisotropy parameter, $\beta$. For these idealised halos, we obtain a general solution to the Jeans equation, which is projected over the line of sight and averaged within an aperture to form the corresponding aperture velocity dispersion profile. Through dimensional analysis, the $M_\mathrm{vir} - \sigma_\mathrm{ap}$ scaling relation is devised explicitly in terms of analytical bounds for these aperture velocity dispersion profiles: allowing constraints to be placed on this relation for motivated parameter choices. We predict the $M_{200} - \sigma_\mathrm{ap}$ and $M_{500} - \sigma_\mathrm{ap}$ scaling relations, each with an uncertainty of $60.5\%$ and $56.2\%$, respectively. These halo mass estimates are found to be weakly sensitive to the halo’s concentration and mass scale, and most sensitive to the size of the aperture radius in which the aperture velocity dispersion is measured, the maximum value for the halo’s inner slope, and the minimum and maximum values of the velocity anisotropy. Our results show that a halo’s structural and kinematic profiles impose only a minor uncertainty in estimating its mass. Consequently, spectroscopic surveys aimed at constraining the halo mass using kinematic tracers can focus on characterising other, more complex sources of uncertainty and observational systematics.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>$α$-Generalized No-Scale Inflation</strong>, Lina Wu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07333v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07333v1</a></p>

<p>We propose the $\alpha$-generalized no-scale supergravity, and study the corresponding inflationary models. With a new parameter $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$, the $\alpha$-generalized no-scale supergravity provides the continuous connections among the generic no-scale supergravity from string theory compactifications. The resulting prediction of the CMB, spectrum index $n_s$, and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ can be highly consistent with the latest Planck/BICEP/Keck Array observations. Notably, the models with $\alpha\neq 1$ give a smaller ratio $r\leq 10^{-3}$, which is flexible even under the anticipated tighter observational constraints at the future experiments. Additionally, these models have the potential to generate a broad-band stochastic gravitational wave background, and thus explain the NANOGrav 15yr signal. Furthermore, they predict the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) with various mass scales, which could account for an significant portion of dark matter relic density in the Universe.</p>

<p>2024-03-13, <strong>The thermalization of $γ$-rays in radioactive expanding ejecta: A simple model and its application for Kilonovae and Ia SNe</strong>, Or Guttman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08769v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.08769v1</a></p>

<p>A semi-analytic approximation is derived for the time-dependent fraction $f_\gamma(t)$ of the energy deposited by radioactive decay $\gamma$-rays in a homologously expanding plasma of general structure. An analytic approximation is given for spherically symmetric plasma distributions. Applied to Kilonovae (KNe) associated with neutron stars mergers and Type Ia supernovae, our semi-analytic and analytic approximations reproduce, with a few percent and 10% accuracy, respectively, the energy deposition rates, $\dot{Q}_\text{dep}$, obtained in numeric Monte Carlo calculations. The time $t_\gamma$ beyond which $\gamma$-ray deposition is inefficient is determined by an effective frequency-independent $\gamma$-ray opacity $\kappa_{\gamma,\text{eff}}$, $t_\gamma = \sqrt{\kappa_{\gamma,\text{eff}}\langle\Sigma\rangle t^2}$, where $\langle\Sigma\rangle\propto t^{-2}$ is the average plasma column density. For $\beta$-decay dominated energy release, $\kappa_{\gamma,\text{eff}}$ is typically close to the effective Compton scattering opacity, $\kappa_{\gamma,\text{eff}} \approx 0.025~{\rm {cm}^{2}\,g^{-1}}$ with a weak dependence on composition. For KNe, $\kappa_{\gamma,\text{eff}}$ depends mainly on the initial electron fraction $Y_e$, $\kappa_{\gamma,\text{eff}} \approx 0.03(0.05)~{\rm {cm}^{2}\,g^{-1}}$ for $Y_e \gtrsim (\lesssim) 0.25$ (in contrast with earlier work that found $\kappa_{\gamma,\text{eff}}$ larger by 1-2 orders of magnitude for low $Y_e$), and is insensitive to the (large) nuclear physics uncertainties. Determining $t_\gamma$ from observations will therefore measure the ejecta $\langle\Sigma\rangle t^2$, providing a stringent test of models. For $\langle\Sigma\rangle t^2=2\times10^{11}~{\rm g\,{cm}^{-2}\,s^2}$, a typical value expected for KNe, $t_\gamma\approx1$ d.</p>

<p>The origin of the diffuse gamma-ray background in the range from hundreds keV to several MeV is not known conclusively. From current models and observations it is believed that, at least partially, this background is formed by blazars and remnants of supernovae (SN) of type Ia in distant galaxies. However, these contributions are not sufficient to reproduce the observed level of the signal. In this work we propose another source which could contribute to this background, namely the jets of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The composition of jets is not known, but there are observational hints that the fraction of positrons there is substantial. Positrons are partially evacuated to the intergalactic medium and partially mix with the circumgalactic medium and annihilate there comparatively quickly. Using the AGN luminosity function, we estimated the positron production rate and the contribution of the positron annihilation to the cosmic background below 511 keV. We also estimated the analogous contribution from positron annihilation within SN Ia remnants in distant galaxies. The contribution of AGNs is estimated to be a factor of 5 - 10 smaller than the observed background intensity, and the contribution from SNe is yet smaller by one order of magnitude. Nevertheless, the contribution of AGNs appeared to be larger than the contribution of blazars estimated from Swift-BAT and Fermi-LAT observations. The main uncertainty in our model is the fraction of positrons remaining in the circumgalactic medium which makes our estimation an upper limit.</p>

<p>2024-03-13, <strong>SN 2023zaw: an ultra-stripped, nickel-poor supernova from a low-mass progenitor</strong>, Kaustav K. Das et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08165v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.08165v1</a></p>

<p>We present SN 2023zaw $-$ a sub-luminous ($\mathrm{M_r} = -16.7$ mag) and rapidly-evolving supernova ($\mathrm{t_{1/2,r}} = 4.9$ days), with the lowest nickel mass ($\approx0.002$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) measured among all stripped-envelope supernovae discovered to date. The photospheric spectra are dominated by broad He I and Ca NIR emission lines with velocities of $\sim10\ 000 - 12\ 000$ $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. The late-time spectra show prominent narrow He I emission lines at $\sim$1000$\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, indicative of interaction with He-rich circumstellar material. SN 2023zaw is located in the spiral arm of a star-forming galaxy. We perform radiation-hydrodynamical and analytical modeling of the lightcurve by fitting with a combination of shock-cooling emission and nickel decay. The progenitor has a best-fit envelope mass of $\approx0.2$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and an envelope radius of $\approx50$ $\mathrm{R_\odot}$. The extremely low nickel mass and low ejecta mass ($\approx0.5$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) suggest an ultra-stripped SN, which originates from a mass-losing low mass He-star (ZAMS mass $&lt;$ 10 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) in a close binary system. This is a channel to form double neutron star systems, whose merger is detectable with LIGO. SN 2023zaw underscores the existence of a previously undiscovered population of extremely low nickel mass ($&lt; 0.005$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) stripped-envelope supernovae, which can be explored with deep and high-cadence transient surveys.</p>

<p>Stellar abundance measurements are subject to systematic errors that induce extra scatter and artificial correlations in elemental abundance patterns. We derive empirical calibration offsets to remove systematic trends with surface gravity $\log(g)$ in 17 elemental abundances of 288,789 evolved stars from the SDSS APOGEE survey. We fit these corrected abundances as the sum of a prompt process tracing core-collapse supernovae and a delayed process tracing Type Ia supernovae, thus recasting each star’s measurements into the amplitudes $A_{\text{cc}}$ and $A_{\text{Ia}}$ and the element-by-element residuals from this two-parameter fit. As a first application of this catalog, which is $8\times$ larger than that of previous analyses that used a restricted $\log(g)$ range, we examine the median residual abundances of 14 open clusters, nine globular clusters, and four dwarf satellite galaxies. Relative to field Milky Way disk stars, the open clusters younger than 2 Gyr show $\approx 0.1-0.2$ dex enhancements of the neutron-capture element Ce, and the two clusters younger than 0.5 Gyr also show elevated levels of C+N, Na, S, and Cu. Globular clusters show elevated median abundances of C+N, Na, Al, and Ce, and correlated abundance residuals that follow previously known trends. The four dwarf satellites show similar residual abundance patterns despite their different star formation histories, with $\approx 0.2-0.3$ dex depletions in C+N, Na, and Al and $\approx 0.1$ dex depletions in Ni, V, Mn, and Co. We provide our catalog of corrected APOGEE abundances, two-process amplitudes, and residual abundances, which will be valuable for future studies of abundance patterns in different stellar populations and of additional enrichment processes that affect galactic chemical evolution.</p>

<p>Strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (LSNe Ia) are a promising probe to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$) directly. To use LSNe Ia for cosmography, a time-delay measurement between the multiple images, a lens-mass model, and a mass reconstruction along the line of sight are required. In this work, we present the machine learning network LSTM-FCNN which is a combination of a Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and a fully-connected neural network (FCNN). The LSTM-FCNN is designed to measure time delays on a sample of LSNe Ia spanning a broad range of properties, which we expect to find with the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and for which follow-up observations are planned. With follow-up observations in $i$ band (cadence of one to three days with a single-epoch $5\sigma$ depth of 24.5 mag), we reach a bias-free delay measurement with a precision around 0.7 days over a large sample of LSNe Ia. The LSTM-FCNN is far more general than previous machine learning approaches such as the Random Forest (RF), where a RF has to be trained for each observational pattern separately, and yet the LSTM-FCNN outperforms the RF by a factor of roughly three. Therefore, the LSTM-FCNN is a very promising approach to achieve robust time delays in LSNe Ia, which is important for a precise and accurate constraint on $H_0$</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Latest Evolution of the X-Ray Remnant of SN 1987A: Beyond the Inner Ring</strong>, Aravind P. Ravi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07990v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07990v1</a></p>

<p>Based on our Chandra imaging-spectroscopic observations, we present the latest evolution of the X-ray remnant of SN 1987A. Recent changes in the electron temperatures and volume emission measures suggest that the blast wave in SN 1987A is moving out of the dense inner ring structure, also called the equatorial ring (ER). The 0.5-2.0 keV X-ray light curve shows a linearly declining trend (by $\sim$4.5 % yr$^{-1}$) between 2016 and 2020, as the blast wave heats the hitherto unknown circumstellar medium (CSM) outside the ER. While the peak X-ray emission in the latest 0.3-8.0 keV image is still within the ER, the radial expansion rate in the 3.0-8.0 keV images suggests an increasing contribution of the X-ray emission from less dense CSM since 2012, at least partly from beyond the ER. It is remarkable that, since 2020, the declining soft X-ray flux has stabilized around $\sim$7 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, which may signal a contribution from the reverse-shocked outer layers of ejecta as predicted by the 3-D magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) models. In the latest ACIS spectrum of supernova remnant (SNR) 1987A in 2022 we report a significant detection of the Fe K line at $\sim$6.7 keV, which may be due to changing thermal conditions of the X-ray emitting CSM and/or the onset of reverse shock interactions with the Fe-ejecta.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>Superphot+: Realtime Fitting and Classification of Supernova Light Curves</strong>, Kaylee M. de Soto et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07975v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07975v1</a></p>

<p>Photometric classifications of supernova (SN) light curves have become necessary to utilize the full potential of large samples of observations obtained from wide-field photometric surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Here, we present a photometric classifier for SN light curves that does not rely on redshift information and still maintains comparable accuracy to redshift-dependent classifiers. Our new package, Superphot+, uses a parametric model to extract meaningful features from multiband SN light curves. We train a gradient-boosted machine with fit parameters from 6,061 ZTF SNe that pass data quality cuts and are spectroscopically classified as one of five classes: SN Ia, SN II, SN Ib/c, SN IIn, and SLSN-I. Without redshift information, our classifier yields a class-averaged F1-score of 0.61 +/- 0.02 and a total accuracy of 0.83 +/- 0.01. Including redshift information improves these metrics to 0.71 +/- 0.02 and 0.88 +/- 0.01, respectively. We assign new class probabilities to 3,558 ZTF transients that show SN-like characteristics (based on the ALeRCE Broker light curve and stamp classifiers), but lack spectroscopic classifications. Finally, we compare our predicted SN labels with those generated by the ALeRCE light curve classifier, finding that the two classifiers agree on photometric labels for 82 +/- 2% of light curves with spectroscopic labels and 72% of light curves without spectroscopic labels. Superphot+ is currently classifying ZTF SNe in real time via the ANTARES Broker, and is designed for simple adaptation to six-band Rubin light curves in the future.</p>

<p>2024-03-12, <strong>SIDE-real: Truncated marginal neural ratio estimation for Supernova Ia Dust Extinction with real data</strong>, Konstantin Karchev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07871v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2403.07871v1</a></p>

<p>We present the first fully simulation-based hierarchical analysis of the light curves of a population of low-redshift type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia). Our hardware-accelerated forward model, released in the Python package slicsim, includes stochastic variations of each SN’s spectral flux distribution (based on the pre-trained BayeSN model), extinction from dust in the host and in the Milky Way, redshift, and realistic instrumental noise. By utilising truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE), a neural network-enabled simulation-based inference technique, we implicitly marginalise over 4000 latent variables (for a set of $\approx 100$ SNae Ia) to efficiently infer SN Ia absolute magnitudes and host-galaxy dust properties at the population level while also constraining the parameters of individual objects. Amortisation of the inference procedure allows us to obtain coverage guarantees for our results through Bayesian validation and frequentist calibration. Furthermore, we show a detailed comparison to full likelihood-based inference, implemented through Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, on simulated data and then apply TMNRE to the light curves of 86 SNae Ia from the Carnegie Supernova Project, deriving marginal posteriors in excellent agreement with previous work. Given its ability to accommodate arbitrarily complex extensions to the forward model – e.g. different populations based on host properties, redshift evolution, complicated photometric redshift estimates, selection effects, and non-Ia contamination – without significant modifications to the inference procedure, TMNRE has the potential to become the tool of choice for cosmological parameter inference from future, large SN Ia samples.</p>
