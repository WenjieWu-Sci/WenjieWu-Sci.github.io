<p>2024-12-12, <strong>Probing a diffuse flux of axion-like particles from galactic supernovae with neutrino water Cherenkov detectors</strong>, David Alonso-González et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09595v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09595v1</a></p>

<p>In this article, we claim that axion-like particles (ALPs) with MeV masses can be produced with semi-relativistic velocities in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), generating a diffuse galactic flux. We show that these ALPs can be detected in neutrino water Cherenkov detectors via $a \, p \rightarrow p \, \gamma$ interactions. Using Super-Kamiokande data, we derive new constraints on the ALP parameter space, excluding a region spanning more than one order of magnitude in the ALP-proton coupling above cooling bounds for ALP masses in the range of $1-80$ MeV and ALP-proton couplings between $6\times10^{-6}-2\times10^{-4}$. We show that the future Hyper-Kamiokande will be able to probe couplings as small as $2\times10^{-6}$, fully closing the allowed region above SN 1987A cooling bounds.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>Limits on dark matter, ultralight scalars, and cosmic neutrinos with gyroscope spin and precision clocks</strong>, Sara Rufrano Aliberti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09575v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09575v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter (DM) within the solar system induces deviations in the geodetic drift of gyroscope spin due to its gravitational interaction. Assuming a constant DM density as a minimal scenario, we constrain DM overdensity within the Gravity Probe B (GP-B) orbit and project limits for Earth’s and Neptune’s orbits around the Sun. The presence of electrons in gravitating sources and test objects introduces a scalar-mediated Yukawa potential, which can be probed using terrestrial and space–based precision clocks. We derive projected DM overdensity $(\eta)$ limits from Sagnac time measurements using onboard satellite clocks, highlighting their dependence on the source mass and orbital radius. The strongest limit, $\eta\lesssim 4.45\times 10^3$, is achieved at Neptune’s orbit ($\sim 30~\mathrm{AU}$), exceeding existing constraints. Correspondingly, the cosmic neutrino overdensity is bounded as $\xi\lesssim 5.34\times 10^{10}$, surpassing results from KATRIN and cosmic ray studies. The best limit on electrophilic scalar coupling is $g\lesssim 7.09\times 10^{-24}$ for scalar mass $m_\varphi\lesssim 1.32\times 10^{-18}~\mathrm{eV}$ competitive with existing fifth-force bounds. These precision measurements offer a robust framework for testing gravity at solar system scales and probing DM in scenarios inaccessible to direct detection experiments.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>Majorana neutrino dipole moments and masses at a muon collider</strong>, Michele Frigerio et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09473v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09473v1</a></p>

<p>A future multi-TeV muon collider would provide an important probe for Majorana neutrinos. A muon collider with a collision energy of $\sim$30 TeV would be sensitive to $\nu_e-\nu_\mu$ transition dipole moments of the order of $\sim 10^{-12}\mu_B$ and would be thus competitive with the latest astrophysical observation and laboratory experiments. Contrary to the latter, the muon collider would have the unique advantage of a direct and clean identification of lepton number and flavour violation. This would establish the Majorana nature of the neutrino and would provide crucial complementary information on the neutrino properties in the event of a (near) future observation at low-energy experiments. Additionally, a muon collider would improve by orders of magnitude the direct bounds on the Majorana neutrino mass matrix entries $m_{e\mu}$ and $m_{\mu\mu}$.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>Fast Flavor Pendulum: Instability Condition</strong>, Damiano F. G. Fiorillo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09027v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09027v1</a></p>

<p>Even in the absence of neutrino masses, a neutrino gas can exhibit a homogeneous flavor instability that leads to a periodic motion known as the fast flavor pendulum. A well-known necessary condition is a crossing of the angular flavor lepton distribution. However, in contrast to an earlier finding by two of us, the Nyquist criterion inspired by plasma physics, while being a more restrictive necessary condition, is not always sufficient. The question depends on the unstable branch of the dispersion relation being bounded by critical points that both lie under the light cone (points with subluminal phase velocity), in which case the Nyquist criterion is sufficient. While the lepton-number angle distribution, assumed to be axially symmetric, easily allows one to determine the real branch of the dispersion relation and to recognize if instead superluminal critical points exist, this graphical method does not translate into a simple instability condition. We discuss the dispersion relation for the homogeneous mode in the more general context of modes with arbitrary wave number and stress that it plays no special role on this continuum, except for its regular but fragile long-term behavior owed to its many symmetries.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>The curtain lowers on directly detectable higgsino dark matter</strong>, Stephen P. Martin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08958v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.08958v1</a></p>

<p>A higgsino could be some or all of the dark matter, with a mass bounded from above by about 1.1 TeV assuming a thermal freezeout density, and from below by collider searches. Direct detection experiments imply purity constraints on a dark matter higgsino, limiting the mixing with the electroweak gauginos. Using the new strong limits available as of the end of 2024 from the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment, I quantify the resulting lower bounds on gaugino masses and upper bounds on higgsino mass splittings, assuming that the scalar superpartners and Higgs bosons of minimal supersymmetry are in the decoupling limit. Similar bounds are projected for the critical future scenario that direct detection experiments reach the neutrino fog that hampers discovery prospects.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>How Many Bursts Does it Take to Form a Core at the Center of a Galaxy?</strong>, Olivia Mostow et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09566v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09566v1</a></p>

<p>We present a novel method for systematically assessing the impact of central potential fluctuations associated with bursty outflows on the structure of dark matter halos for dwarf and ultra-faint galaxies. Specifically, we use dark-matter-only simulations augmented with a manually-added massive particle that modifies the central potential and approximately accounts for a centrally-concentrated baryon component. This approach enables precise control over the magnitude, frequency, and timing of when rapid outflow events occur. We demonstrate that this method can reproduce the established result of core formation for systems that undergo multiple episodes of bursty outflows. In contrast, we also find that equivalent models that undergo only a single (or small number of) burst episodes do not form cores with the same efficacy. This is important because many ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies in the local universe are observed to have tightly constrained star formation histories that are best described by a single, early burst of star formation. Using a suite of cosmological, zoom-in simulations, we identify the regimes in which single bursts can and cannot form a cored density profile, and therefore, can or cannot resolve the core-cusp problem.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>FLAMINGO: Galaxy formation and feedback effects on the gas density and velocity fields</strong>, Lurdes Ondaro-Mallea et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09526v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09526v1</a></p>

<p>Most of the visible matter in the Universe is in a gaseous state, subject to hydrodynamic forces and galaxy formation processes that are much more complex to model than gravity. These baryonic effects can potentially bias the analyses of several cosmological probes, such as weak gravitational lensing. In this work, we study the gas density and velocity fields of the FLAMINGO simulations and compare them with their gravity-only predictions. We find that, while the gas velocities do not differ from those of dark matter on large scales, the gas mass power spectrum is suppressed by up to $\approx 8\%$ relative to matter, even on gigaparsec scales. This is a consequence of star formation depleting gas in the densest and most clustered regions of the universe. On smaller scales, $k&gt;0.1 \, h / \rm Mpc$, the power suppression for both gas densities and velocities is more significant and correlates with the strength of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The impact of feedback can be understood in terms of outflows, identified as gas bubbles with positive radial velocities ejected from the central galaxy. With increasing feedback strength, the outflowing gas has higher velocities, and it reaches scales as large as $10$ times the virial radius of the halo, redistributing the gas and slowing its average infall velocity. Interestingly, different implementations of AGN feedback leave distinct features in these outflows in terms of their radial and angular profiles and their dependence on halo mass. In the future, such differences could be measured in observations using, for example, the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>Search for Inelastic Boosted Dark Matter with the ICARUS Detector at the Gran Sasso Underground National Laboratory</strong>, H. Carranza et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09516v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09516v1</a></p>

<p>We present the result of a search for inelastic boosted dark matter using the data corresponding to an exposure of 0.13 kton$\cdot$year, collected by the ICARUS T-600 detector during its 2012–2013 operational period at the INFN Gran Sasso Underground National Laboratory. The benchmark boosted dark matter model features a multi-particle dark sector with a U(1)$’$ gauge boson, the dark photon. The kinetic mixing of the dark photon with the Standard Model photon allows for a portal between the dark sector and the visible sector. The inelastic boosted dark matter interaction occurs when a dark matter particle inelastically scatters with an electron in the ICARUS detector, producing an outgoing, heavier dark sector state which subsequently decays back down to the dark matter particle, emitting a dark photon. The dark photon subsequently couples to a Standard Model photon through kinetic mixing. The Standard Model photon then converts to an electron-positron pair in the detector. This interaction process provides a distinct experimental signature which consists of a recoil electron from the primary interaction and an associated electron-positron pair from the secondary vertex. After analyzing 4,134 triggered events, the search results in zero observed events. Exclusion limits are set in the dark photon mass and coupling ($m_X, \epsilon$) parameter space for several selected optimal boosted dark matter mass sets.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>Gravitational ABJ Anomaly, Stochastic Matter Production, and Leptogenesis</strong>, Azadeh Maleknejad et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09490v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09490v1</a></p>

<p>Partially chiral stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds can arise from various processes in the early Universe. The gravitational ABJ anomaly links the chirality of the gravitational field to the chiral fermions, resulting in the stochastic generation of fermionic matter in the radiation era. We show that this mechanism can account for the entire dark matter relic density and discuss its potential as a leptogenesis scenario to explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Remarkably, this letter reveals that even if gravitational waves become unpolarized later, their temporary chirality during their generation process leaves a lasting imprint on the fermionic matter, preserved as a quantum remnant.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>Searching for New Physics in Ultradense Environment: a Review on Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars</strong>, Francesco Grippa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09381v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09381v1</a></p>

<p>Neutron Stars (NSs), among the densest objects in the Universe, are exceptional laboratories for investigating Dark Matter (DM) properties. Recent theoretical and observational developments have heightened interest in exploring the impact of DM on NS structure, giving rise to the concept of Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars (DANSs). This review examines how NSs can accumulate DM over time, potentially altering their fundamental properties. We explore leading models describing DM behavior within NSs, focusing on the effects of both bosonic and fermionic candidates on key features such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Additionally, we review how DM can modify the cooling and heating processes, trigger the formation of a black hole, and impact Gravitational Waves (GWs) emissions from binary systems. By synthesizing recent research, this work highlights how DANSs might produce observable signatures, offering new opportunities to probe DM properties through astrophysical phenomena.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>Constraining primordial black hole abundance with Insight-HXMT</strong>, Chen Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09297v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09297v1</a></p>

<p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a major candidate for dark matter and they have been extensively constrained across most mass ranges. However, PBHs in the mass range of $10^{17}-10^{21}$ g remain a viable explanation for all dark matter. In this work, we use observational data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) to refine constraints on PBHs within the mass range of $10^{16}-10^{18}$ g. Our analysis explores three scenarios: directly using observational data, incorporating the astrophysical background model (ABM), and employing the power-law spectrum with an exponential cutoff. Additionally, we also account for photon flux from positron annihilation due to Hawking radiation in our calculations. Our findings indicate that directly using observational data significantly tightens constraints on PBHs with masses above $10^{17}$ g, owing to Insight-HXMT’s exceptional sensitivity to hard X-rays. Incorporating the ABM further enhances the constraints by approximately 0.8 orders of magnitude. The exclusion limit for PBHs as dark matter extends to $8\times 10^{17}$ g, nearly doubling the current threshold. Moreover, extrapolating the energy limit with a power-law model improves constraints by approximately one order of magnitude compared to the ABM scenario.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>Interacting dark energy models</strong>, Robert Rugg et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09024v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09024v1</a></p>

<p>This work focuses on two linear interaction models between dark matter and dark energy, which are proposed as key factors in explaining cosmic history, specifically the latetime accelerating expansion of the universe. Both models are constrained using a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis (MCMC) using different sets of observational data. The analysis was composed using the Pantheon data set, consisting of 1048 points of SNIa distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon analysis and the Observed Hubble Parameter (OHD) data set using Baryon acoustic Oscillation (BAO), consisting of 57 data points using distance and expansion rate measurement. Both models showed promising results with the OHD data (BAO), with a interaction that results in a higher dark matter content of 56% and 44%, and a Hubble parameter of 65.7+-3km/ s/Mpc and 65.8+-3km/ s/Mpc for the interaction dependent on dark matter and dark energy respectively. The pantheon data set however predicted a reverse interaction for both models which does not follow initial assumptions that were made. The pantheon data measured a dark matter content of 18% and 20% with a Hubble parameter of 72.1 +- 0.003km/ s/Mpc and 72.3 +- 0.004km /s/Mpc. The constrained results are used to revisit the coincidence problem and other problems in standard cosmology. The analysis provided a discrepancy between the different data sets with one having a large error margin.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>High Quality QCD Axion via Electric-Magnetic Duality</strong>, Shota Nakagawa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08931v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.08931v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a novel paradigm for the QCD axion with high-quality Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry on the basis of electric-magnetic duality in the conformal window of a supersymmetric gauge theory. PQ breaking fields, that contain the QCD axion, emerge in the magnetic theory and possess a large anomalous dimension, which leads to not only generation of an intermediate scale of spontaneous PQ breaking but also significant suppression of explicit PQ symmetry breaking operators. The high PQ quality and the absence of a Landau pole in the color gauge coupling are achieved. The parameter space to realize the correct abundance of the axion dark matter (DM) predicts explicit PQ violation which may be probed by future measurements of the neutron electric dipole moment. In the other viable parameter space, the lightest supersymmetric particle can become a DM candidate. Since the model naturally accommodates a mechanism to suppress the axion isocurvature fluctuation, it provides a complete solution to the strong CP problem as well as the identity of DM.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>Scalar perturbations on the normal and self-accelerating branch of a DGP brane and $σ_8$</strong>, Maribel Hernández Márquez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08852v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.08852v1</a></p>

<p>In this work we constrain the value of $\sigma_8$ for the normal and self-accelerating branch of a DGP brane embedded in a five-dimensional Minkowski space-time. For that purpose we first constrain the model parameters $H_0$, $\Omega_{m0}$, $\Omega_{r0}$ and $M$ by means of the Pantheon+ catalog and a mock catalog of gravitational waves. Then, we solve numerically the equation for dark matter scalar perturbations using the dynamical scaling solution for the master equation and assuming that $p=4$ for the matter dominated era. Finally, we found that the evolution of matter density perturbations in both branches is different from the $\Lambda$CDM model and that the value of $\sigma_8=0.774\pm0.027$ for the normal branch and $\sigma_8=0.913\pm0.032$ for the self-accelerating branch.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>Modified gravity/Dynamical Dark Energy vs $Λ$CDM: is the game over?</strong>, Sergei D. Odintsov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09409v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09409v1</a></p>

<p>Over the last decades, tests on the standard model of cosmology, the so-called $\Lambda$CDM model, have been widely analysed and compared with many different models for describing dark energy. Modified gravities have played an important role in this sense as an alternative to $\Lambda$CDM model. Previous observational data has been always favouring $\Lambda$CDM model in comparison to any other model. While statistically speaking, alternative models have shown tehir power, fitting in some cases the observational data slightly better than $\Lambda$CDM, the significance and goodness of the fits were not significantly relevant to exclude the standard model of cosmology. In this paper, a generalisation of exponential $F(R)$ gravity is considered and compared with $\Lambda$CDM model by using the latest observational data. Also some well-known model independent parameterisations for the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy are explored. These scenarios are confronted with the renewed observational data involving the Pantheon plus datasets of supernovae type Ia, the Hubble parameter estimations, data from the cosmic microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillations, where the latter includes the data provided by Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument collaboration. Results of this analysis suggest that standard exponential $F(R)$ models provide much better fits than $\Lambda$CDM model, which is excluded at 4$\sigma$. Moreover, the parameterisations of the equation of state suggest a non-constant EoS parameter for dark energy, where $\Lambda$CDM model is also excluded at 4$\sigma$.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>Insights from Modeling Magnetar-driven Light Curves of Stripped-envelope Supernovae</strong>, Amit Kumar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09357v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09357v1</a></p>

<p>This work presents the semi-analytical light curve modelling results of 11 stripped-envelope SNe (SESNe), where millisecond magnetars potentially drive their light curves. The light-curve modelling is performed utilizing the $\chi^2$-minimisation code $\texttt{MINIM}$ considering millisecond magnetar as a central engine powering source. The magnetar model well regenerates the bolometric light curves of all the SESNe in the sample and constrains numerous physical parameters, including magnetar’s initial spin period ($P_\textrm{i}$) and magnetic field ($B$), explosion energy of supernova ($E_\textrm{exp}$), progenitor radius ($R_\textrm{p}$), etc. Within the sample, the superluminous SNe 2010kd and 2020ank exhibit the lowest $B$ and $P_\textrm{i}$ values, while the relativistic Ic broad-line SN 2012ap shows the highest values for both parameters. The explosion energy for all SESNe in the sample (except SN 2019cad), exceeding $\gtrsim$2 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg, indicates there is a possibility of a jittering jet explosion mechanism driving these events. Additionally, a correlation analysis identifies linear dependencies among parameters derived from light curve analysis, revealing positive correlations between rise and decay times, $P_\textrm{i}$ and $B$, $P_\textrm{i}$ and $R_\textrm{p}$, and $E_\textrm{exp}$ and $R_\textrm{p}$, as well as strong anti-correlations of $P_\textrm{i}$ and $B$ with the peak luminosity. Principal Component Analysis is also applied to key parameters to reduce dimensionality, allowing a clearer visualization of SESNe distribution in a lower-dimensional space. This approach highlights the diversity in SESNe characteristics, underscoring unique physical properties and behaviour across different events in the sample. This study motivates further study on a more extended sample of SESNe to look for millisecond magnetars as their powering source.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>Using nebular near-IR spectroscopy to measure asymmetric chemical distributions in 2003fg-like thermonuclear supernovae</strong>, J. O’Hora et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09352v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09352v1</a></p>

<p>We present an analysis of three near-infrared (NIR; 1.0-2.4 $\mu$m) spectra of the SN 2003fg-like/”super-Chandrasekhar” type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) SN 2009dc, SN 2020hvf, and SN 2022pul at respective phases +372, +296, and +294~d relative to the epoch of $B$-band maximum. We find that all objects in our sample have asymmetric, or “tilted”, [Fe~II] 1.257 and 1.644 $\mu$m profiles. We quantify the asymmetry of these features using five methods: velocity at peak flux, profile tilts, residual testing, velocity fitting, and comparison to deflagration-detonation transition models. Our results demonstrate that, while the profiles of the [Fe II] 1.257 and 1.644 $\mu$m features are widely varied between 2003fg-likes, these features are correlated in shape within the same SN. This implies that line blending is most likely not the dominant cause of the asymmetries inferred from these profiles. Instead, it is more plausible that 2003fg-like SNe have aspherical chemical distributions in their inner regions. These distributions may come from aspherical progenitor systems, such as double white dwarf mergers, or off-center delayed-detonation explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass Carbon-Oxygen white dwarfs. Additional late-phase NIR observation of 2003fg-like SNe and detailed 3-D NLTE modeling of these two explosion scenarios are encouraged.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>Is cosmological data suggesting a nonminimal coupling between matter and gravity?</strong>, Miguel Barroso Varela et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09348v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09348v1</a></p>

<p>Theoretical predictions from a modified theory of gravity with a nonminimal coupling between matter and curvature are compared to data from recent cosmological surveys. We use type Ia supernovae data from the Pantheon+ sample and the recent 5-year Dark Energy Survey (DES) data release along with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) to constrain the modified model’s parameters and to compare its fit quality to the Flat-$\Lambda$CDM model. We find moderate to strong evidence for a preference of the nonminimally coupled theory over the current standard model for all dataset combinations. Although the modified model is shown to be capable of matching early-time observations from the cosmic microwave background and late-time supernovae data, we find that there is still some incoherence with respect to the conclusions drawn from baryon acoustic oscillation observations.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>Molecular chemistry induced by J-shock toward supernova remnant W51C</strong>, Tian-Yu Tu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09092v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09092v1</a></p>

<p>Shock waves from supernova remnants (SNRs) have strong influence on the physical and chemical properties of molecular clouds (MCs). Shocks propagating into magnetized MCs can be classified into “jump” J-shock and “continuous” C-shock. The molecular chemistry in the re-formed molecular gas behind J-shock is still not well understood, which will provide a comprehensive view of the chemical feedback of SNRs and the chemical effects of J-shock. We conducted a W-band (71.4-89.7 GHz) observation toward a re-formed molecular clump behind a J-shock induced by SNR W51C with the Yebes 40 m radio telescope to study the molecular chemistry in the re-formed molecular gas. Based on the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumption, we estimate the column densities of HCO+, HCN, C2H and o-c-C3H2, and derive the maps of their abundance ratios with CO. The gas density is constrained by non-LTE analysis of the HCO+ J=1-0 line. We obtain the following abundance ratios: $N({\rm HCO^+})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.0\text{–}4.0)\times 10^{-4}$, $N({\rm HCN})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.8\text{–}5.3)\times 10^{-4}$, $N({\rm C_2H})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.6\text{–}5.0)\times 10^{-3}$, and $N({o\text{-}c\text{-}{\rm C_3H_2}})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.2\text{–}7.9)\times 10^{-4}$. The non-LTE analysis suggests that the gas density is $n_{\rm H_2}\gtrsim 10^4\rm \ cm^{-3}$. We find that the N(C2H)/N(CO) and N(o-c-C3H2)/N(CO) are higher than typical values in quiescent MCs and shocked MCs by 1-2 orders of magnitude, which can be qualitatively attributed to the abundant C+ and C at the earliest phase of molecular gas re-formation. The Paris-Durham shock code can reproduce, although not perfectly, the observed abundance ratios, especially the enhanced N(C2H)/N(CO) and N(o-c-C3H2)/N(CO), with J-shocks propagating in to both non-irradiated and irradiated molecular gas with a preshock density of $n_{\rm H}=2\times 10^3\rm \ cm^{-3}$.</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>Insights into the Properties of Type Ibn/Icn Supernovae and Their Progenitor Channels through X-ray Emission</strong>, Yusuke Inoue et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09066v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09066v1</a></p>

<p>Type Ibn/Icn supernovae (SNe Ibn/Icn), which are characterized by narrow helium or carbon lines originated in hydrogen-poor dense circumstellar medium (CSM), provide new insights into the final evolution of massive stars. While SNe Ibn/Icn are expected to emit strong X-rays through the strong SN-CSM interaction, the X-ray emission modeling effort has been limited so far. In the present study, we provide broad-band X-ray light curve (LC) predictions for SNe Ibn/Icn. We find that the soft X-ray LC provides information about the CSM compositions, while the hard X-ray LC is a robust measure of the CSM density, the explosion energy, and the ejecta mass. In addition, considering the evolution of the ionization state in the unshocked CSM, a bright soft X-ray is expected in the first few days since the explosion, which encourages rapid X-ray follow-up observations as a tool to study the nature of SNe Ibn/Icn. Applying our model to the soft X-ray LCs of SNe Ibn 2006jc and 2022ablq, we derive that the CSM potentially contains a larger fraction of carbon and oxygen for SN 2006jc than 2022ablq, highlighting the power of the soft X-ray modeling to address the nature of the CSM. We also discuss detectability and observational strategy, with which the currently operating telescopes such as NuSTAR and Swift can offer an irreplaceable opportunity to explore the nature of these enigmatic rapid transients and their still-unclarified progenitor channel(s).</p>

<p>2024-12-12, <strong>A comprehensive numerical study on four categories of holographic dark energy models</strong>, Jun-Xian Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09064v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2412.09064v1</a></p>

<p>Holographic dark energy (HDE), which arises from a theoretical attempt of applying the holographic principle (HP) to the dark energy (DE) problem, has attracted significant attention over the past two decades. We perform a most comprehensive numerical study on HDE models that can be classified into four categories: 1) HDE models with other characteristic length scale, 2) HDE models with extended Hubble scale, 3) HDE models with dark sector interaction, 4) HDE models with modified black hole entropy. For theoretical models, we select seven representative models, including the original HDE (OHDE) model, Ricci HDE (RDE) model, generalized Ricci HDE (GRDE) model, interacting HDE (IHDE1 and IHDE2) models, Tsallis HDE (THDE) model, and Barrow HDE (BHDE) model. For cosmological data, we use the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 measurements, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors data from the Planck 2018, and the type Ia supernovae (SN) data from the PantheonPlus compilation. Using $\chi^2$ statistic and Bayesian evidence, we compare these HDE models with current observational data. It is found that: 1) The $\Lambda$CDM remains the most competitive model, while the RDE model is ruled out. 2) HDE models with dark sector interaction perform the worst across the four categories, indicating that the interaction term is not favored under the framework of HDE. 3) The other three categories show comparable performance. The OHDE model performs better in the BAO+CMB dataset, and the HDE models with modified black hole entropy perform better in the BAO+CMB+SN dataset. 4) HDE models with the future event horizon exhibit significant discrepancies in parameter space across datasets. The BAO+CMB dataset favors a phantom-like HDE, whereas the BAO+CMB+SN leads to an equation of state (EoS) much closer to the cosmological constant.</p>
