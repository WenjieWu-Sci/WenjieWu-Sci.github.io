<p>2025-10-09, <strong>Constraining the new contributions to electron $g-2$ in a radiative neutrino mass model</strong>, Bayu Dirgantara et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08504v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.08504v1</a></p>

<p>We examine electron and muon anomalous magnetic dipole moments within a radiative neutrino mass model featuring TeV-scale scalar leptoquarks $S(3,1,-1/3)$ and $R(3,2,1/6)$. We utilize textures with decoupling electron and muon sectors, so that both electron and muon anomalous magnetic dipole moments could receive internal chiral enhancements from different heavy up-type quarks while in the same time evading the stringent $\mu\to e\gamma$ constraint. A successful fit to neutrino oscillation data requires the simultaneous presence of one- and two-loop neutrino mass contributions. This severely constrains the parameter space of the model, which results in a negligible new physics correction to the muon $g-2$. The electron $g-2$ discrepancy implied by the rubidium experiment, on the other hand, can be resolved within $2\sigma$ uncertainty provided that neutrino mass ordering is inverted. Lepton-flavor-violating tau decay rates, such as $\tau\to e\gamma$ and $\tau\to 3e$, are predicted to be within the sensitivities of next-generation experiments.</p>

<p>Neutrino oscillations are a phenomenon that has been observed for over two decades and leads to the conclusion that neutrinos have mass. The Standard Model predicts massless neutrinos, and so neutrinos require physics beyond the Standard Model. Other signatures of BSM physics are detectable in modern neutrino facilities – this chapter explores those possibilities. These can range from new effects modifying neutrino oscillations (beyond the expectations when neutrinos have mass), to searches for new particles in neutrino facilities. Next-generation experiments are particularly powerful for these searches due to high-intensity neutrino beams and novel detection technologies. We give an introduction to these search strategies, giving a non-comprehensive overview of the field as it stands presently.</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>Identification of low-energy kaons in the ProtoDUNE-SP detector</strong>, DUNE Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08380v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.08380v1</a></p>

<p>The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a next-generation neutrino experiment with a rich physics program that includes searches for the hypothetical phenomenon of proton decay. Utilizing liquid-argon time-projection chamber technology, DUNE is expected to achieve world-leading sensitivity in the proton decay channels that involve charged kaons in their final states. The first DUNE demonstrator, ProtoDUNE Single-Phase, was a 0.77 kt detector that operated from 2018 to 2020 at the CERN Neutrino Platform, exposed to a mixed hadron and electron test-beam with momenta ranging from 0.3 to 7 GeV/c. We present a selection of low-energy kaons among the secondary particles produced in hadronic reactions, using data from the 6 and 7 GeV/c beam runs. The selection efficiency is 1\% and the sample purity 92\%. The initial energies of the selected kaon candidates encompass the expected energy range of kaons originating from proton decay events in DUNE (below $\sim$200 MeV). In addition, we demonstrate the capability of this detector technology to discriminate between kaons and other particles such as protons and muons, and provide a comprehensive description of their energy loss in liquid argon, which shows good agreement with the simulation. These results pave the way for future proton decay searches at DUNE.</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>Neutrinoless double beta decay in a supersymmetric left-right model</strong>, Vivek Banerjee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08090v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.08090v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay, an important low-energy process, serves not only as a potential test of the Majorana nature of neutrinos, but also as a sensitive probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. In this study, the supersymmetric left-right model is explored to investigate its impact on $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. Although the process takes place at low energies as compared to the electroweak scale, it carries the potential to provide indirect hints about the parity-breaking scale $\text{M}_R$. In this work, we formulate the decay amplitude using an effective field theory approach by separating long- and short-range contributions, each expressed in terms of dimensionless particle physics parameters and nuclear matrix elements. The analysis shows that the $\text{M}_R$ must lie above $1$ TeV, and future experiments may push it beyond $4 - 5$ TeV region. Another important outcome of this work is the role played by the tentative dark matter candidates, the lightest neutralino and sneutrino, which contribute significantly to the half-life of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. This suggests that if any supersymmetric particle is detected in future experiments, dark matter candidates will gain a permanent position in these extensions of the Standard Model.</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>Aluminum-Based Superconducting Tunnel Junction Sensors for Nuclear Recoil Spectroscopy</strong>, Spencer L. Fretwell et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07792v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.07792v1</a></p>

<p>The BeEST experiment is searching for sub-MeV sterile neutrinos by measuring nuclear recoil energies from the decay of $^7$Be implanted into superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensors. The recoil spectra are affected by interactions between the radioactive implants and the sensor materials. We are therefore developing aluminum-based STJs (Al-STJs) as an alternative to existing tantalum devices (Ta-STJs) to investigate how to separate material effects in the recoil spectrum from potential signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model. Three iterations of Al-STJs were fabricated. The first had electrode thicknesses similar to existing Ta-STJs. They had low responsivity and reduced resolution, but were used successfully to measure $^7$Be nuclear recoil spectra. The second iteration had STJs suspended on thin SiN membranes by backside etching. These devices had low leakage current, but also low yield. The final iteration was not backside etched, and the Al-STJs had thinner electrodes and thinner tunnel barriers to increase signal amplitudes. These devices achieved 2.96 eV FWHM energy resolution at 50 eV using a pulsed 355 nm (~3.5 eV) laser. These results establish Al-STJs as viable detectors for systematic material studies in the BeEST experiment.</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>Reconstructing the local density field with combined convolutional and point cloud architecture</strong>, Baptiste Barthe-Gold et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08573v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.08573v1</a></p>

<p>We construct a neural network to perform regression on the local dark-matter density field given line-of-sight peculiar velocities of dark-matter halos, biased tracers of the dark matter field. Our architecture combines a convolutional U-Net with a point-cloud DeepSets. This combination enables efficient use of small-scale information and improves reconstruction quality relative to a U-Net-only approach. Specifically, our hybrid network recovers both clustering amplitudes and phases better than the U-Net on small scales.</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>The dark sector of the Universe as a scalar field in Horndeski Gravity</strong>, M. S. Oliveira et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08459v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.08459v1</a></p>

<p>In the present work, we study a subclass of Horndeski gravity characterized by a non-minimal derivative coupling between a scalar field and the Einstein tensor, as a possible alternative to alleviate the observational tension associated with estimates of the Hubble constant $H_{0}$. Two scenarios within a flat FRW spacetime were considered. In the first case, the scalar field mimics cold dark matter, whereas in the second case, it acts as dark energy. We derive the dynamical equations and perform a statistical analysis using observational data of $H(z)$, obtaining constraints for the cosmological parameters. The results indicate that the model can effectively fit the cosmic expansion rate at late epochs, providing values of $H_{0}$ that are more compatible with local measurements. These results suggest that the non-minimal coupling sector in the Horndeski context constitutes a viable and promising approach to alleviate the $H_{0}$ tension and investigate scenarios beyond the standard cosmological model.</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>A first look at quasar-galaxy clustering at $z\simeq7.3$</strong>, Jan-Torge Schindler et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08455v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.08455v1</a></p>

<p>We present JWST observations of the environments surrounding two high-redshift quasars – J0252$-$0503 at $z = 7.0$ and J1007$+$2115 at $z = 7.5$ – which enable the first constraints on quasar-galaxy clustering at $z \sim 7.3$. Galaxies in the vicinity of the quasars are selected through ground-based and JWST/NIRCam imaging and then spectroscopically confirmed with JWST/NIRSpec using the multi-shutter assembly (MSA). Over both fields, we identify 51 $z&gt;5$ galaxies, of which eight are found within a $\Delta v_{\textrm{LOS}}=\pm1500 \rm{km} \rm{s}^{-1}$ line-of-sight velocity window from the quasars and another eight in the background. The galaxy J0252\_8713, located just $7\,\rm{pkpc}$ and $\Delta v_{\textrm{LOS}} \approx 360\,\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ from quasar J0252$-$0503, emerges as a compelling candidate for one of the most distant quasar-galaxy mergers. Combining the galaxy discoveries over the two fields, we measure the quasar-galaxy cross-correlation and obtain a correlation length of $r_0^{\rm{QG}}\approx7.6_{-1.6}^{+1.7}\,h^{-1}\,\rm{cMpc}$, based on a power-law model with a fixed slope of $\gamma_{\rm{QG}} = 2.0$. Under the assumption that quasars and galaxies trace the same underlying dark matter density fluctuations, we infer a minimum dark matter halo mass for $z\simeq7.3$ quasars of $\log_{10}(M_{\textrm{halo, min}}/\textrm{M}_{\odot})= 11.6\pm0.6$ in a halo model framework. Compared to measurements from EIGER at $\langle z \rangle = 6.25$ and ASPIRE at $\langle z \rangle = 6.7$ (where $\log_{10}(M_{\textrm{halo, min}}/\textrm{M}_{\odot}) \gtrsim 12.3$), our clustering results provide tentative evidence for a non-monotonic redshift evolution of quasar clustering properties. We further estimate a quasar duty cycle of $f_{\rm{duty}}\approx0.1\%$, consistent with constraints from quasar proximity zones and IGM damping wings. (abridged)</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>Primordial Black Holes, Charge, and Dark Matter: Rethinking Evaporation Limits</strong>, Sebastian Schuster et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08375v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.08375v1</a></p>

<p>Limits on the dark matter fraction of small mass primordial black holes from Hawking radiation are predominantly derived from the assumption of a Schwarzschild black hole evaporating. However, astrophysical black holes are usually much more realistically modelled by the rotating Kerr black hole solution. Meanwhile, electromagnetically charged black holes are astrophysically of little importance due to their fast neutralisation in the present universe. Dark matter is not just a possible solution to issues of astrophysics and cosmology, but also to issues of the standard model of particle physics. Extensions of this model thus can lead to charges present in the early universe which remain preserved in the charge of primordial black holes - even when the corresponding particles have disappeared from the particle content of the present epoch of the universe. Here, we report on a thorough proof-of-concept that such charges can greatly change evaporation limits for primordial black hole dark matter. Special emphasis is placed on (near-)extremal black holes, for which this effect is especially pronounced.</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>The superclustering of hot gas: cosmological sensitivity in the Websky simulations</strong>, M. Lokken et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08331v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.08331v1</a></p>

<p>Combinations of galaxy surveys and cosmic microwave background secondaries, such as the thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich (tSZ) effect, are increasingly being used to jointly constrain cosmology and astrophysical properties of the gas within and beyond halos. Standard cross-correlations measure a directionless correlation between the microwave maps and galaxy catalogs. However, more information about the cosmic web structure can be captured by summary statistics which include environmental constraints and measure oriented correlations along axes of structure, such as filaments or superclusters. This work studies the sensitivity of multipole moments of constrained oriented stacks, a directional and environmentally-dependent statistic, to variations in cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We run nine different 2.4 Gpc-per-side simulations with the Websky algorithm, varying the dark matter energy density within flat $\Lambda$CDM, and create mock tSZ maps with each. We also apply six different gas prescriptions, imitating AGN feedback variations, to the fiducial cosmology. We analyze oriented stacks of the tSZ signal in supercluster regions in each simulation, focusing on signal out to $\sim20$ transverse Mpc from massive ($M&gt;5\times10^{13}~M_\odot$) halos. The cosmology variations affect anisotropic and isotropic measurements similarly, while the halo-pasted gas variations mostly affect the isotropic signal. Our results suggest it is worthwhile to incorporate directional information into SZ-galaxy cross-correlations to increase cosmological sensitivity and help break degeneracies with gas physics.</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>The Dependence of Halo Clustering on Subhalo Anisotropy and Planarity</strong>, Nathaniel P. Johnson et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08293v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.08293v1</a></p>

<p>We show that host cold dark matter (CDM) haloes cluster in a manner that depends upon the anisotropy/planarity of their subhaloes, indicating an environmental dependence to subhalo anisotropy/planarity. The spatial distribution of satellite galaxies about central galaxies and correspondingly, the spatial distribution of subhaloes about host haloes have been subjects of interest for two decades. Important questions include the degree to which satellites are distributed anisotropically about their hosts or exhibit planarity in their distributions and the degree to which this anisotropy depends upon the environment of the host-satellite system. We study the spatial distributions of subhaloes in a cosmological N-body simulation. We find that CDM subhaloes are distributed in a manner that is strongly anisotropic/planar, in agreement with prior work, though our presentation is complementary. The more novel result is that this anisotropy has an environmental dependence. Systems which exhibit less (more) anisotropy and less (more) planarity cluster more strongly (weakly). Systems in which subhaloes reside further from their host centres cluster more weakly. None of these clustering effects are caused by a correlation between subhalo anisotropy/planarity and other properties on which host halo clustering is known to depend, such as concentration, spin parameter, host halo shape, or subhalo count. We discuss the impact of this result on the anisotropy of satellites as predicted by CDM, its testability, and its possible relation to anisotropy observed about the large galaxies of the Local Group.</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>Probing Strange Dark Matter through $f$-mode Oscillations of Neutron Stars with Hyperons and Quark Matter</strong>, Mahboubeh Shahrbaf et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08115v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.08115v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the impact of a hypothetical bosonic dark matter (DM) candidate, the sexaquark, on the fundamental ($f$-mode) oscillations of neutron stars (NSs). By varying the DM particle mass and considering different core compositions including hypernuclear matter, sexaquark DM, and deconfined quark matter (QM), we construct hybrid equations of state (EOS) with a smooth hadron–quark crossover that remain consistent with current astrophysical constraints on mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Our analysis shows that the presence of these exotic components systematically alters quasi-universal $f$-mode relations. In particular, relations involving $f$–$\sqrt{M/R^{3}}$, $(R^{4}/M^{3}\tau)(C)$, $\omega M(C)$, require higher-order polynomial fits compared to standard studies. Quadratic forms remain sufficient for $f$–$\sqrt{M/R^{3}}$ and $\omega M(C)$, while damping-time relations such as $(R^{4}/M^{3}\tau)(C)$ demand higher-order corrections to capture their curvature. For $f(\Lambda)$, a cubic fit provides a satisfactory description. Within this extended framework the relations remain tight and effectively composition independent. These results suggest that precise $f$-mode measurements with future gravitational-wave detectors could provide clear signatures of DM and other exotic matter in NS interiors.</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>Atomic Observables Induced by Cosmic Fields</strong>, Sebastian Lahs et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08007v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.08007v1</a></p>

<p>The existence of cosmic fields made from yet unknown light bosons is predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model. They are especially of interest as possible constituents of dark matter. To detect such light and weakly interacting fields, atomic precision measurements offer one of the most sensitive platforms. In this work, we derive which atomic observables are sensitive to what kind of cosmic field couplings. For this we consider fields that couple either through scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial vector, or tensor couplings. We derive the corresponding non relativistic atomic potentials. Based on their symmetry properties, these can induce direct energy shifts or induce atomic electric dipole, magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole as well as nuclear Schiff and anapole moments.</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>Emission of Nambu-Goldstone bosons from the semilocal string network</strong>, Yukihiro Kanda et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07894v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.07894v1</a></p>

<p>Semilocal cosmic string is a line-like non-topological soliton associated with the breakdown of the $SU(2)_{\rm global} \times U(1)_{\rm gauge}$ symmetry to the $U(1)_{\rm global}$ symmetry. The broken phase has two massless Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes as dynamical fields, and they can be emitted by semilocal strings. In this paper, we numerically show that such NG bosons are copiously produced with the evolution of the semilocal string network in the early universe. Our numerical analysis shows that the spectrum of produced particles has a peak at low momenta corresponding to the horizon scale. If the emitted NG bosons acquire mass due to soft-breaking terms, they can take the role of dark matter. This scenario typically predicts very light pseudo NG boson dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>FlowLensing: Simulating Gravitational Lensing with Flow Matching</strong>, Hamees Sayed et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07878v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.07878v1</a></p>

<p>Gravitational lensing is one of the most powerful probes of dark matter, yet creating high-fidelity lensed images at scale remains a bottleneck. Existing tools rely on ray-tracing or forward-modeling pipelines that, while precise, are prohibitively slow. We introduce FlowLensing, a Diffusion Transformer-based compact and efficient flow-matching model for strong gravitational lensing simulation. FlowLensing operates in both discrete and continuous regimes, handling classes such as different dark matter models as well as continuous model parameters ensuring physical consistency. By enabling scalable simulations, our model can advance dark matter studies, specifically for probing dark matter substructure in cosmological surveys. We find that our model achieves a speedup of over 200$\times$ compared to classical simulators for intensive dark matter models, with high fidelity and low inference latency. FlowLensing enables rapid, scalable, and physically consistent image synthesis, offering a practical alternative to traditional forward-modeling pipelines.</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>Constraints on inelastic dark matter from the CDEX-1B experiment</strong>, Y. F. Liang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07800v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.07800v1</a></p>

<p>We present limits on spin-independent inelastic WIMP-nucleus scattering using the 737.1 kg $\cdot$ day dataset from the CDEX-1B experiment. Expected nuclear recoil spectra for various inelastic WIMP masses $m_\chi$ and mass splittings $\delta$ are calculated under the standard halo model. An accurate background model of CDEX-1B is constructed by simulating all major background sources. The model parameters are then determined through maximum likelihood estimation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting. The resulting 90\% confidence level upper limits on the WIMP-nucleon cross section $\sigma_{\mathrm{n}}$ exclude certain DAMA/LIBRA allowed regions: the $\chi^2 &lt; 4$ regions for $\delta &lt; 30$ keV at $m_\chi = 250$ GeV and the $\chi^2 &lt; 9$ region for $\delta &lt; 50$ keV at $m_\chi = 500$ GeV. The method is applicable to other inelastic dark matter scenarios, and the upcoming CDEX-50 experiment is expected to improve sensitivity by four orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>AT 2018cow at ~5 years: additional evidence for a tidal disruption origin</strong>, Anne Inkenhaag et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08505v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.08505v1</a></p>

<p>The Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient (LFBOT) AT 2018cow is the prototype of its class with an extensive set of multi-wavelength observations. Despite a rich data set there is, still, no consensus about the physical nature and origin of this event. AT 2018cow remained UV bright 2-4 years after the explosion, which points at an additional energy injection source, most likely from an accretion disk. We present additional late time UV data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, to show there is no significant fading in the optical since the last epoch and only marginal fading in the UV. The new UV data points match the predictions of previously published accretion disk models, where the disk is assumed to form from the tidal disruption of a low mass star by an intermediate mass black hole. This consistency provides evidence that AT 2018cow could indeed be a tidal disruption event. The marginal decay is in contrast with the predictions of light curves produced by interacting supernovae. The difference between expectations for disc emission and interacting supernovae will further increase with time, making data at even later times a route to robustly rule out interaction between supernova ejecta and circumstellar material.</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>Probing departures from $Λ$CDM by late-time datasets</strong>, Himanshu Chaudhary et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08339v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.08339v1</a></p>

<p>Observational data play a pivotal role in identifying cosmological models that are both theoretically consistent and empirically viable. In this work, we investigate whether the standard $\Lambda$CDM model exhibits significant departure with current late time datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI DR2, and various Type Ia supernova compilations (Pantheon$^+$, DES-SN5Y, Union3). We analyze several dynamical dark energy models, including $\omega$CDM, o$\omega$CDM, $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE. While CC + DESI DR2 data show mild deviations from $\Lambda$CDM ($\lesssim 2\sigma$), adding supernova samples (DES-SN5Y or Union3) increases deviations, with BA, JBP, and Logarithmic models reaching $3-3.5\sigma$, and CC + DESI DR2 + DES-SN5Y producing the largest deviations. We find consistent evidence for $\omega_0 &gt; -1$ and $\omega_a &lt; 0$ in all dark energy models, indicating that the cosmological constant faces a potential crisis and that dynamical dark energy models could provide a possible solution, characterized by a Quintom-B type scenario. The $\Lambda$CDM model has long served as the cornerstone of modern cosmology, successfully shaping our understanding of the Universe from its earliest epochs to the present day. However, in light of DESI DR2 and other recent measurements, emerging cracks in this paradigm suggest that a complete understanding of the cosmos may require moving beyond the cosmological constant and exploring new physics governing the dark sector.</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>Detection of supernova magnitude fluctuations induced by large-scale structure</strong>, A. Nguyen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07673v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.07673v1</a></p>

<p>The peculiar velocities of supernovae and their host galaxies are correlated with the large-scale structure of the Universe, and can be used to constrain the growth rate of structure and test the cosmological model. In this work, we measure the correlation statistics of the large-scale structure traced by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Bright Galaxy Survey Data Release 1 sample, and magnitude fluctuations of type Ia supernova from the Pantheon+ compilation across redshifts z &lt; 0.1. We find a detection of the cross-correlation signal between galaxies and type Ia supernova magnitudes. Fitting the normalised growth rate of structure f sigma_8 to the auto- and cross-correlation function measurements we find f sigma_8 = 0.384 +0.094 -0.157, which is consistent with the Planck LambdaCDM model prediction, and indicates that the supernova magnitude fluctuations are induced by peculiar velocities. Using a large ensemble of N-body simulations, we validate our methodology, calibrate the covariance of the measurements, and demonstrate that our results are insensitive to supernova selection effects. We highlight the potential of this methodology for measuring the growth rate of structure, and forecast that the next generation of type Ia supernova surveys will improve f sigma_8 constraints by a further order of magnitude.</p>

<p>2025-10-09, <strong>Testing Lens Models of PLCK G165.7+67.0 Using Lensed SN H0pe</strong>, Aadya Agrawal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07637v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2510.07637v1</a></p>

<p>Supernova H0pe is a multiply-imaged Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) and the second lensed SN to yield a measurement of the Hubble constant by the time-delay cosmography method, finding $H_0 = 75.4^{+8.1}_{-5.5} \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We investigate the seven lens modeling approaches used to derive $H_0$, assessing their agreement with $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ constraints from SN Ia surveys through a purely observational comparison. While photometrically derived magnifications yield distance moduli in line with $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ expectations, our comparison reveals that lens model predictions, even the most precise ones, consistently overestimate the magnification, with a offset of $ \Delta \mu &gt; 1$ mag. This known bias, already appreciated by modeling teams, is independently confirmed through our analysis and highlights the value of lensed SNe as a tool to test model accuracy. If unaccounted for, such magnification biases can propagate into uncertainties in derived cosmological parameters, including $H_0$, and affect the interpretation of future precision measurements. These findings highlight a critical challenge for precision cosmology using strongly lensed transients. With next-generation surveys such as LSST, Roman, and Euclid poised to discover many more gravitationally lensed supernovae, the development and validation of robust, accurate lens models will be essential for using these rare events to probe cosmology.</p>
