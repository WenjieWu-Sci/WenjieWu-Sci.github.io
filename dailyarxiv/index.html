<p>2025-07-07, <strong>Electromagnetic energy calibration of the SoLid detector with horizontal muons</strong>, SoLid collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05180v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05180v1</a></p>

<p>SoLid is a neutrino experiment at very-short baseline searching for active-to-sterile oscillations of reactor antineutrinos. The detection principle is based on the pairing of two types of solid scintillators: polyvinyl toluene and $^6$Li:ZnS(Ag), which is a new technology used in this field of Physics. In addition to good neutron-gamma discrimination, this setup allows the detector to be highly segmented; the basic detection unit is a 5 cm cube. High segmentation provides numerous advantages including precise localisation of the Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) products, the derivation of an antineutrino energy estimator based on the isolated positron energy, and a powerful background reduction tool that relies on the topological signature of the signal. Finally, the system is read out by a network of WLS fibres coupled to photosensors. A relative electromagnetic calibration is performed with horizontal cosmic muons. This source poses the simplest calibration problem in which a single detection unit is involved. In addition, large muon energy deposits allow us to perform a calibration at the most detailed level (i.e. per fibre) and to accurately define the fraction of energy escaping to neighbouring detection cells. A statistical precision at the sub-percent level is reached. The paper also discusses two methods to calibrate the absolute energy scale. The first method relies on horizontal muons, though the precision is limited to around 10\% because of the uncertainty in the energy distribution of such muons. A novel, alternative method based on the radioactive AmBe source is proposed. It takes advantage of the electron-positron pair-production process and provides a calibration point at 3.4 MeV (i.e. in the core of the IBD positron spectrum). The paper is concluded with various cross-check including a determination of the energy spectrum of the standard cosmogenic background candle: $^{12}$B.</p>

<p>2025-07-07, <strong>Effect of Off-diagonal NSI Parameters on Entanglement Measurements in Neutrino Oscillations</strong>, Lekhashri Konwar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04885v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.04885v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we explore the influence of off-diagonal non-standard interaction (NSI) parameters on quantum entanglement within the three-flavor neutrino oscillation framework. By expressing three key entanglement measures: Entanglement of Formation (EOF), Concurrence, and Negativity in terms of oscillation probabilities, we analyze how these quantum correlations are affected by the NSI parameters $\epsilon_{e\mu}$, $\epsilon_{e\tau}$, and $\epsilon_{\mu\tau}$, including their complex phases. Using the DUNE experiment as a benchmark, we find that NSI effects are most significant at low energies, with Negativity showing the highest sensitivity even at high energies. It is observed that $\epsilon_{e \mu}$ and $\epsilon_{e \tau}$ affect entanglement measures mainly through the appearance channel, while the impact of $\epsilon_{\mu \tau}$ on EOF, Concurrence, and Negativity is predominantly linked to the disappearance channel.</p>

<p>2025-07-07, <strong>Asymmetric emissions of neutrinos in the cooling of rotating proto-neutron stars</strong>, Laura Barrio et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04784v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.04784v1</a></p>

<p>We evaluate global asymmetry in the luminosities of neutrinos emitted from rapidly-rotating proto-neutron stars (PNS’s). We build axisymmetric models of PNS’s in mechanical equilibrium with rotation by adding prescribed angular momentum distributions by hand to non-rotational PNS models, which are extracted from a one-dimensional (spherically symmetric) PNS cooling calculation at different times: (t=2, 6, 10, 20, 30)s after a supernova explosion. We then conduct two-dimensional (spatially axisymmetric) neutrino transport calculations on top of them with the matter profiles (and the spacetime geometry) fixed. We find for the rapidly-rotating models with (T/|W|\sim 5\times 10^{-2}) that the neutrino luminosity changes by (\sim 3 \% ) depending on the observer position. We give detailed analyses of the neutrino-hemispheres as well as the neutrino luminosities that are defined observer-wise. We also calculate the low-frequency ((\lesssim 1{\rm Hz})) gravitational waves produced by the neutrinos radiated asymmetrically. We find that those gravitational waves, if emitted from the Galactic center, can be detected by planned detectors such as B-DECIGO, DECIGO and AILA. Finally, we look for crossings in the energy-integrated angular distributions in momentum space for the electron neutrino sector, a signature of the fast flavor conversion. We find them near the PNS surface in all models.</p>

<p>2025-07-07, <strong>A Rephasing Invariant Formula for the Dirac CP Phase and its Perturbative Expansion: Prospects for DUNE and T2HK</strong>, Masaki J. S. Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04720v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.04720v1</a></p>

<p>We present a formula for the Dirac CP phase $\delta = \arg ( U_{e1} U_{e2} U_{\mu 3} U_{\tau 3} / U_{e3} \det U_{\rm MNS} )$, directly derived from the lepton mixing matrix in an arbitrary basis. In contrast to the numerically suppressed Jarlskog invariant, this expression is computationally simple and less sensitive to approximations. We apply the formula to derive perturbative corrections from charged-lepton mixing $s_{ij}^{e}$ to the underlying CP phase of neutrinos $\delta_{\nu}$. A compact analytic expressions $\delta = \delta_{\nu} + s_{12}^{e} D_{12} + s_{13}^{e} D_{13} + s_{23}^{e} D_{23}$ shows that these corrections can substantially exceed $O(10^{\circ})$, potentially within the reach of future long-baseline experiments such as DUNE and T2HK.</p>

<p>2025-07-07, <strong>Cosmological Simulations with Massive Neutrinos: Efficiency and Accuracy</strong>, Bing-Hang Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04627v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.04627v1</a></p>

<p>Constraining neutrino mass through cosmological observations relies on precise simulations to calibrate their effects on large scale structure, while these simulations must overcome computational challenges like dealing with large velocity dispersions and small intrinsic neutrino perturbations. We present an efficient N-body implementation with semi-linear neutrino mass response which gives accurate power spectra and halo statistics. We explore the necessity of correcting the expansion history caused by massive neutrinos and the transition between relativistic and non-relativistic components. The above method of including neutrino masses is built into the memory-, scalability-, and precision-optimized parallel N-body simulation code CUBE 2.0. Through a suite of neutrino simulations, we precisely quantify the neutrino mass effects on the nonlinear matter power spectra and halo statistics.</p>

<p>2025-07-06, <strong>The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) Project</strong>, Kumiko Kotera et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04382v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.04382v1</a></p>

<p>Measuring ultra-high energy neutrinos, with energies above $10^{16}$ eV, is the next frontier of the emerging multi-messenger era. Their detection requires building a large-scale detector with 10 times the instantaneous sensitivity of current instruments, sub-degree angular resolution, and wide daily field of view. The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) is designed to be that discovery instrument. HERON combines the complementary features of two radio techniques being demonstrated by the BEACON and GRAND prototypes. Its preliminary design consists of 24 compact, elevated phased stations with 24 antennas each, embedded in a sparse array of 360 standalone antennas. This setup tunes the energy threshold to below 100 PeV, where the neutrino flux should be high. The sensitivity of the phased stations combines with the powerful reconstruction capacities of the standalone antennas to produce an optimal detector. HERON is planned to be installed at an elevation of 1,000 m across a 72 km-long mountain range overlooking a valley in Argentina’s San Juan province. It would be connected to the worldwide network of multimessenger observatories and search for neutrino bursts from candidate sources of cosmic rays, like gamma-ray bursts and other powerful transients. With HERON’s deep sensitivity, this strategy targets discoveries that cast new light into the inner workings of the most violent astrophysical sources at uncharted energies. We present the preliminary design, performances, and observation strategy of HERON.</p>

<p>2025-07-06, <strong>From $U(1) \times U(1)$ Symmetry Breaking to Majoron Cosmology: Insights from NANOGrav 15-year Data</strong>, Tathagata Ghosh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04342v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.04342v1</a></p>

<p>We study the cosmology of a modified majoron model motivated by the need to protect a global $U(1)$ symmetry from gravity-induced hard explicit breaking (by $d \leq 4$ operators) at the Planck scale. The model extends the Standard Model by introducing a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ and an approximate global $U(1)$ symmetry, each spontaneously broken by a corresponding complex scalar singlet. This setup gives rise to a network of effectively global and local cosmic strings, whose stochastic gravitational wave signals can jointly account for the spectrum observed by the NANOGrav collaboration, particularly for majoron masses $m_{\chi} &lt; 10^{-23}$ eV. Although the fit is not as strong as that from supermassive black hole mergers, the model still provides an alternative explanation rooted in high-energy physics. The model also generates light neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and avoids cosmological constraints from $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$, CMB anisotropies, and isocurvature fluctuations. Although the majoron can contribute to dark matter through thermal, coherent oscillation, and string-induced production mechanisms, its relic abundance remains subdominant in the NANOGrav-compatible region. In contrast, the measured dark matter relic density is achievable at higher $m_\chi$, though at the cost of tension with cosmological bounds. If the NANOGrav fits are viewed as constraints, given their comparatively lower Bayes factors, they yield bounds that are significantly stronger than those imposed by the CMB and other cosmological data.</p>

<p>2025-07-06, <strong>NUTRIG: Development of a Novel Radio Self-Trigger for GRAND</strong>, Pablo Correa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04339v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.04339v1</a></p>

<p>The NUTRIG project is dedicated to the development of advanced radio self-trigger methods for large-scale arrays such as the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND). The developed techniques are based on features of the radio emission of air showers to perform an efficient online rejection of background. We first describe a first-level trigger (FLT) template-matching method that uses the shape of transient radio pulses measured at the detection-unit level to target those induced by air showers. We present trigger efficiencies and throughput tests of the template-matching FLT in controlled laboratory conditions. Next, we describe the second-level trigger (SLT), which utilizes the measured FLT times and corresponding voltage amplitudes to construct a trigger at the array level. We present offline performances of the SLT, which performs a coarse reconstruction of timing, direction, and polarization of the air shower.</p>

<p>2025-07-06, <strong>Reconstruction of inclined cosmic-ray properties with GRAND data</strong>, Marion Guelfand et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04324v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.04324v1</a></p>

<p>Radio-detection is now an established technique for studying ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays with energies exceeding $\sim 10^{17}$ eV. The next generation of radio experiments, such as the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), aims to expand this technique to the observation of Earth-skimming UHE neutrinos, which requires the detection of very inclined extensive air showers (EAS). Currently, GRAND is validating its detection principle – autonomous radio detection – in particular through the prototype array GRANDProto300, deployed in the Gobi Desert. In this phase, the array is limited to detecting inclined EAS from cosmic rays. Neutrinos cannot be observed because of the restricted detector size. We present a method to reconstruct the arrival direction and energy of EAS with zenith angles above $60^\circ$, applicable as well to upward-going trajectories. The approach combines a point-source-like description of the radio wavefront with the so-called Angular Distribution Function (ADF), a phenomenological model describing the angular pattern of radio signal amplitudes in the 50–200 MHz band. Applied directly to the voltage traces, this method enables efficient event selection with accurate direction reconstruction and a first-order energy estimate. We validate the approach with both simulations and experimental data, and reconstruct the first cosmic-ray candidates detected by GRANDProto300.</p>

<p>2025-07-06, <strong>The Milky Way is a Laboratory for New Ultra-long-baseline Neutrino Physics</strong>, Miller MacDonald et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04193v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.04193v1</a></p>

<p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory recently published evidence for diffuse neutrino emission from the Galactic Plane at $4.5\sigma$ significance. This new source of astrophysical neutrinos provides an exciting laboratory for probing the nature of neutrino masses. In particular, extremely small mass splittings, such as those predicted by quasi-Dirac neutrino mass models, and finite neutrino lifetimes from neutrino decays, would induce effects on the spectra and flavor ratios of neutrinos with TeV-scale energies traversing kiloparsec-scale baselines. Using $\mathtt{TANDEM}$, an upcoming three dimensional galactic neutrino emission model, we explore the sensitivity of IceCube and KM3NeT/ARCA to these ultra-long-baseline phenomena. We find that a combined analysis would be sensitive to quasi-Dirac mass splittings $10^{-14.0}~\mathrm{eV^2} \lesssim \delta m^2 \lesssim 10^{11.6}~\mathrm{eV^2}$ and neutrino lifetimes $m / \tau \gtrsim 10^{-14.1}~\mathrm{eV^2}$ at $&gt; 1\sigma$, both regions constituting as-yet unexplored parameter space. Our results demonstrate the potential that astrophysical neutrino sources and global neutrino telescope networks have in probing new regions of exotic neutrino mass models.</p>

<p>2025-07-07, <strong>Interacting Scalar Fields as Dark Energy and Dark Matter in Einstein scalar Gauss Bonnet Gravity</strong>, Saddam Hussain et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05207v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05207v1</a></p>

<p>A Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field $\phi$, responsible for the late-time cosmic acceleration and interacting with a coherent scalar field $\psi$ through an interaction potential $W(\phi,\psi)$, is considered from the point of view of particle physics for two different models. The non-minimal coupling between the GB curvature term and the field $\phi$ leads to a time-dependent speed of gravitational waves (GWs), which is fixed to unity in order to be consistent with current GW observations, rendering the GB coupling function model-independent. We investigate the dynamical stability of the system by formulating it in the form of an autonomous system, and constrain the model parameters using various sets of observational data. We find that both models are physically viable and closely follow the $\Lambda$CDM trend. We also use the updated Roman mock high redshift data to further constrain the parameters of the two models.</p>

<p>2025-07-07, <strong>Magnetic flux threading a planar holed superconductor</strong>, Jaume Cunill-Subiranas et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05041v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05041v1</a></p>

<p>We analytically evaluate the currents in a planar-holed ideal (perfect magnetic shielding) superconductor when an axial dipole is located along the system’s axis, obtaining a simple relation between the fluxoid (in this geometry, it equals the flux) threading the hole, the net current circling it, and the magnitude and position of the dipole. This expression has to be added to the basic screening equations describing the superconductor to understand the different physical situations that can appear. Thus several scenarios are studied: field and zero-field cooling cases, where the flux threading the hole is fixed; superconductors with a slit where the net current circling the hole is zero; and self-inductance case, where the flux threading the hole is only due to the screening currents. All the presented results are analytical for the axial dipole and are given as a function of the distance of the dipole from the plane of the superconductor. The obtained results can serve as a benchmark for recent and ongoing micromechanical experiments aimed at developing ultrasensitive gravimeters or applications searching for exotic spin-dependent interactions and dark matter, for example.</p>

<p>2025-07-07, <strong>Shadows of rotating black holes with parity-odd scalar hair</strong>, Yang Huang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04761v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.04761v1</a></p>

<p>Strong self-gravitational fields enable the realization of macroscopic odd-parity quantum objects. Using ray-tracing methods, we systematically analyze the shadow features of rotating black holes with parity-odd scalar hair and contrast them with those of Kerr black holes. Our results demonstrate measurable distinctions between scalar-haired black hole shadows and their Kerr counterparts. Notably, even for tiny scalar charge and negligible scalar hair mass contributions, these differences remain quantitatively resolvable. These findings provide critical theoretical benchmarks for future observational campaigns targeting scalar-field dark matter candidates through black hole shadow imaging.</p>

<p>2025-07-07, <strong>Exact solution of Schrödinger equation for the complex Morse potential to investigate physical systems with position-dependent complex mass</strong>, Partha Sarathi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04658v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.04658v1</a></p>

<p>This paper presents the exact ground state solution for a diatomic particle system with position-dependent complex mass under action of a complex Morse potential in the quantum domain. By solving the position-dependent Schr"odinger equation in extended complex phase space without assuming a specific mass profile, we derive both the eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenenergies using the analyticity conditions of the eigenfunctions. A key focus is placed on addressing the challenge of normalization inherent in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. To overcome the limitations of conventional normalization methods in systems with complex potentials and spatially varying mass, we propose a modified normalization approach based on a two-dimensional integral over phase space. The results reveal that, under certain parameter constraints, real energy spectra can arise in non Hermitian settings, supported by normalized and physically meaningful eigenfunctions. Probability density plots validate the existence of stable, localized bound states, maintaining essential characteristics of the traditional Morse potential. Moreover, the model offers potential applications in high-energy and cosmological physics, particularly in the quantum description of exotic systems like dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-07-06, <strong>Effective Equation of State Oscillations at Matter-Radiation Equality and Primordial Gravitational Waves</strong>, S. D. Odintsov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04571v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.04571v1</a></p>

<p>The theory controlling the Universe’s evolution in the classical regime has to be motivated by particle physics reasoning and should also generate inflation and dark energy eras in a unified way. One such framework is $F(R)$ gravity. In this work we examine a class of exponential deformations of $R^2$ gravity motivated by fundamental physics of scalaron evolution in a de Sitter background. As we show this class of models describe both inflation and the dark energy era in a viable way compatible with the Planck constraints on inflation and the cosmological parameters. Regarding the inflationary era, the exponentially deformed $R^2$ model also yields a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term which remarkably does not affect the dynamics and the inflationary evolution is identical to that of an $R^2$ model. The dark energy era is also found to be viable and mimics the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. More importantly, this class of $F(R)$ gravity exponential $R^2$ deformations also has an important characteristic, and specifically it yields total equation of state oscillations deeply in the matter domination era, for redshifts $z\sim 3400$, so near the matter-radiation equality. These total equation of state deformations at such a large redshift may directly affect the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves. Indeed as we show, the effect is measurable and it leads to an enhancement of the tensor perturbations energy spectrum for low frequencies probed by the future LiteBIRD mission. This enhancement might have a measurable effect on the $B$-modes of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation and thus may be detectable by the LiteBIRD mission. Only a handful of theoretical frameworks can generate the gravitational wave pattern generated by the class of exponentially deformed $R^2$ models we presented.</p>

<p>The next generation of cosmology surveys will probe the matter distribution of the universe to unparalleled precision. To match this level of precision in cosmological parameter estimation, we need to use information at small scales of $\sim$ 1 Mpc, which requires an accurate model of baryonic feedback. In this paper, we employ the Dark Matter + Baryon (DMB) model, a flexible halo model that is well-fit to various hydrodynamical simulations, to extract information on baryonic feedback from galaxy cluster observables. Using a sample of thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) selected galaxy clusters from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) - with masses calibrated via weak lensing from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) - we develop a robust end-to-end pipeline that directly models the calibrated observables. Our analysis demonstrates that the tSZ Y-M relation can constrain several DMB model parameters, providing key insights into baryonic feedback effects on cosmic shear at the several percent level. We find a preference for intermediate to strong levels of feedback, which is both consistent with several hydrodynamic simulations and competitive with similar analyses performed on complementary probes. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of current and upcoming cosmic shear surveys.</p>

<p>We report on a search for axion dark matter in the frequency range near 5.9 GHz, conducted using the haloscope technique. The experiment employed an 8-cell microwave resonator designed to extend the accessible frequency range by a multi-fold factor relative to conventional single-cell configurations, while maintaining a large detection volume. To enhance sensitivity, a flux-driven Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA) operating near the quantum noise limit was utilized, together with a sideband-summing method that coherently combines mirrored spectral components generated by the JPA. Data were acquired over the frequency range 5.83-5.94 GHz. With no statistically significant excess observed, we exclude axion-photon couplings $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ down to $1.2 \times 10^{-14}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at a 90% confidence level. The achieved sensitivity approaches the KSVZ benchmark prediction, setting the most stringent limits to date in this range.</p>

<p>2025-07-06, <strong>The nano-hertz and milli-hertz stochastic gravitational waves in the minimal clockwork axion model</strong>, Xiangwei Yin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04281v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.04281v1</a></p>

<p>The clockwork framework can realize TeV-scale $U(1)_{PQ}$ symmetry breaking while generating a large axion decay constant (f_a). We propose a minimal clockwork axion model with three scalar fields, in which two domain walls (DWs) have non-zero tension. The DW associated with one of the fields is formed following the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking and subsequently collapses due to the potential bias induced by the QCD instanton. The nano-hertz stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) generated from this DW annihilation can be probed by Pulsar Timing Arrays experiments. In addition, the DW related to the other field is annihilated by a bias potential originating from higher-dimensional operators, producing a significant GW signal with a peak frequency around (9.41\times10^{-5}) Hz, which can be detected by the LISA, Taiji, and TianQin experiments. Constraints on the model from SN1987, dark matter overproduction, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave background, and primordial black holes have been considered. The relic density of QCD axion dark matter can be explained through the misalignment mechanism.</p>

<p>Cosmic evolution is the most sensational topic among researchers of modern cosmology. This article explores cosmic evolution in 4D Einstein Gauss Bonnet (EGB) gravity, focusing on mass accretion of compact objects (black holes and wormholes) by dark energy (DE). Three DE models Chevallier Polarski Linder (CPL), Jassal Bagla Padmanabhan (JBP), and Barboza Alcaniz (BA) parameterizations are studied within 4D EGB gravity, with their Hubble parameters derived and compared against observational data (Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and CMB). Bayesian analysis favors the CPL and BA models, with CPL providing the best fit. For black holes, mass accretion of CPL and JBP DE shows transitions between quintessence and phantom eras, while BA and LambdaCDM strictly exhibit quintessence-like behavior, driving cosmic acceleration. In contrast, wormholes exhibit the opposite trend, favoring a phantom-dominated era for the BA and LambdaCDM models. The study highlights the dynamic nature of DE in 4D EGB gravity and its role in cosmic expansion.</p>

<p>We present \texttt{COMPASS}, a novel simulation-based inference framework that combines score-based diffusion models with transformer architectures to jointly perform parameter estimation and Bayesian model comparison across competing Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. \texttt{COMPASS} handles high-dimensional, incomplete, and variable-size stellar abundance datasets. % Applied to high-precision elemental abundance measurements, \texttt{COMPASS} evaluates 40 combinations of nucleosynthetic yield tables. The model strongly favours Asymptotic Giant Branch yields from NuGrid and core-collapse SN yields used in the IllustrisTNG simulation, achieving near-unity cumulative posterior probability. Using the preferred model, we infer a steep high-mass IMF slope and an elevated Supernova\,Ia normalization, consistent with prior solar neighbourhood studies but now derived from fully amortized Bayesian inference. % Our results demonstrate that modern SBI methods can robustly constrain uncertain physics in astrophysical simulators and enable principled model selection when analysing complex, simulation-based data.</p>

<p>2025-07-07, <strong>Multidimensional Nebular-Phase Calculations of Dynamically-Driven Double-Degenerate Double-Detonation Models for Type Ia Supernovae</strong>, J. M. Pollin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05000v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.05000v1</a></p>

<p>The dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation model has emerged as a promising progenitor candidate for Type Ia supernovae. In this scenario, the primary white dwarf ignites due to dynamical interaction with a companion white dwarf, which may also undergo a detonation. Consequently, two scenarios exist: one in which the secondary survives and another in which both white dwarfs detonate. In either case, substantial departures from spherical symmetry are imprinted on the ejecta. Here, we compute full non local thermodynamic equilibrium nebular-phase spectra in 1D and 3D to probe the innermost asymmetries. Our simulations reveal that the multidimensional structures significantly alter the overall ionisation balance, width and velocity of features, especially when the secondary detonates. In this scenario, some element distributions may produce orientation-dependent line profiles that can be centrally peaked from some viewing-angles and somewhat flat-topped from others. Comparison to observations reveals that both scenarios produce most observed features from the optical to mid-infrared. However, the current model realisations do not consistently reproduce all line shapes or relative strengths, and yield prominent optical Ar III emission which is inconsistent with the data. When the secondary detonates, including 3D effects, improves the average agreement with observations, however when compared to observations, particularly weak optical Co III emission and the presence of optical O I and near-infrared S I challenge its viability for normal Type Ia supernovae. Thus, our comparisons with normal Type Ia’s tentatively favour detonation of only the primary white dwarf, but we stress that more model realisations and mid-infrared observations are needed.</p>

<p>2025-07-06, <strong>Resolving the origin of the unidentified TeV source HESS J1626-490 as a relic of the ancient cosmic-ray factory SNR G335.2+0.1</strong>, Tomohiko Oka et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04407v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.04407v1</a></p>

<p>While decades of observations in the TeV gamma-ray band have revealed more than 200~sources with radio or X-ray counterparts, there remain dozens of unidentified TeV sources, which may provide crucial information of cosmic ray (CR) accelerators. HESS J1626$-$490 is an unidentified TeV gamma-ray source but is expected to originate from CRs that escaped from the nearby supernova remnant (SNR) G335.2+0.1 and are interacting with dense interstellar clouds. To test this scenario, we scrutinize the properties of the SNR and search for non-thermal counterparts by analyzing observational data in the radio, X-ray, and GeV gamma-ray bands. From analysis of the H\,{\sc i} and $^{12}$CO ($J{=}1{-}0$) line data, we identify the cloud associated with the SNR and compare the morphologies of the cloud and the gamma-ray emission. The distance and age of the SNR are estimated to be $3.3 \pm 0.6$~kpc and ${\sim}5$~kyr, respectively. From X-ray and GeV gamma-ray data analyses, we find an extended GeV gamma-ray emission overlapping with the SNR and H.E.S.S. source regions but no X-ray emission. The location of the peak of the extended GeV emission changes from near the SNR at $\lesssim 1$~GeV to the H.E.S.S. source at $&gt;10$~GeV. We find a spectral hardening at ${\sim}50$~GeV, which is consistent with the existence of two components in the gamma-ray emission. We find that a combination of emission from the escaped CRs and the SNR itself can reproduce the observed broadband spectrum, on the assumption that the SNR has accelerated protons to ${\gtrsim}100$~TeV in the past.</p>

<p>2025-07-06, <strong>Neutron Star-White Dwarf Merger as One Possible Optional Source of Kilonova-like Emission: Implications for GRB 211211A</strong>, Xiao-Xuan Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04318v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.04318v1</a></p>

<p>Long-duration GRB 211211A, which lacked an associated supernova at such a low redshift $z=0.076$, but was associated with a possible kilonova emission, has attracted great attention. The neutron star-white dwarf (NS-WD) merger is proposed as a possible progenitor of GRB 211211A, and it could naturally explain the long duration of the prompt emission. However, the NS-WD merger is not an ideal site for producing heavy elements via r-process nucleosynthesis. In this Letter, we investigate the heavy elements produced in NS-WD mergers based on numerical simulations of nucleosynthesis via SkyNet, and then calculate the resulting kilonova-like emission to compare with the solidly observed case of possible kilonova emission associated with GRB 211211A. By adopting three models (i.e., Model-A, Model-B, and Model-C) from \cite{2023ApJ…956…71K} at different temperatures ($T=4$ GK, 5 GK, and 6 GK), which are treated as free parameters, we find that the mass number of the heaviest element produced in our simulations is less than 90 ($A&lt; 90$). Moreover, by comparing the calculated kilonova-like emission with the afterglow-subtracted observations of the possible kilonova associated with GRB 211211A, it is found that the merger of NS and WD cannot be ruled out as the origin of GRB 211211A to produce the possible kilonova emission if the remnant of the WD-NS merger is a supramassive or stable magnetar. Otherwise, it is difficult to explain the early possible kilonova emission following GRB 211211A by invoking the merger of a WD and an NS.</p>

<p>2025-07-06, <strong>Torsion cosmology in the light of DESI, supernovae and CMB observational constraints</strong>, Tonghua Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04265v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.04265v1</a></p>

<p>We present a torsion-based cosmological model within the Einstein-Cartan framework, analyze it using combined DESI, PantheonPlus/DESY5, and CMB datasets, a reveals several interesting features. The torsion parameter $\alpha$ shows a trend of change from $\alpha=0.042^{+0.035}_{-0.031}$ (CMB alone) to $\alpha=-0.0075\pm0.0058$ (full dataset), while remaining consistent with zero within $1.7\sigma$. The model demonstrates potential in addressing cosmological tensions, yielding $H_0 = 68.80\pm0.48~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ and reducing the $S_8$ tension from $0.73\sigma$ to $0.1\sigma$ through its torsion-modified growth equation. Bayesian evidence analysis shows a clear preference for torsion cosmology in most dataset combinations, with the notable exception of CMB+DESI+DESY5 which slightly favors $\Lambda$CDM. Remarkably, substituting DESY5 with PantheonPlus data reverses this preference, yielding $\Delta\log\mathcal{Z} = -3.59$ - a strong indication of the model’s viability. While not conclusive, these findings suggest torsion cosmology merits further investigation as a potential extension to $\Lambda$CDM.</p>
