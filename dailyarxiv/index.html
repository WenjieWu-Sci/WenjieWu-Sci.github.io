<p>2023-10-25, <strong>Quasithermal GeV neutrinos from neutron-loaded magnetized outflows in core-collapse supernovae: spectra and light curves</strong>, Jose Alonso Carpio et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16823v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.16823v1</a></p>

<p>Rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized protoneutron stars (PNSs) created in core-collapse supernovae can drive relativistic magnetized winds. Ions and neutrons can be co-accelerated while they remain coupled through elastic collisions. We investigate the nucleosynthesis and subsequent nuclear disintegration, and find that relativistic neutrons can be generated in such magnetized winds. Upon eventual decoupling, resulting inelastic collisions with ejecta lead to pion production, resulting in $0.1-10\,{\rm GeV}$ neutrinos. Following this scenario presented in Murase, Dasgupta &amp; Thompson, Phys. Rev. D, 89, 043012 (2014), we numerically calculate the spectra and light curves of quasithermal neutrino emission and find that power-law tails are formed without cosmic-ray acceleration. In the event of a Galactic supernova, $\sim 10-1000$ neutrino events could be detected with Hyper-Kamiokande, KM3Net-ORCA and IceCube-Upgrade for PNSs with surface magnetic field $B_{\rm dip}\sim 10^{13-15}\,{\rm G}$ and initial spin period $P_i \sim 1-30\,{\rm ms}$. Successful detection will enable us to study supernovae as multienergy neutrino sources and may provide clues to the roles of PNSs in diverse classes of transients.</p>

<p>2023-10-25, <strong>STRAW-b (STRings for Absorption length in Water-b): the second pathfinder mission for the Pacific Ocean Neutrino Experiment</strong>, Kilian Holzapfel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16714v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.16714v1</a></p>

<p>Since 2018, the potential for a high-energy neutrino telescope, named the Pacific Ocean Neutrino Experiment (P-ONE), has been thoroughly examined by two pathfinder missions, STRAW and STRAW-b, short for short for Strings for Absorption Length in Water. The P-ONE project seeks to install a neutrino detector with a one cubic kilometer volume in the Cascadia Basin’s deep marine surroundings, situated near the western shores of Vancouver Island, Canada. To assess the environmental conditions and feasibility of constructing a neutrino detector of that scale, the pathfinder missions, STRAW and STRAW-b, have been deployed at a depth of 2.7 km within the designated site for P-ONE and were connected to the NEPTUNE observatory, operated by Ocean Networks Canada (ONC). While STRAW focused on analyzing the optical properties of water in the Cascadia Basin, \ac{strawb} employed cameras and spectrometers to investigate the characteristics of bioluminescence in the deep-sea environment. This report introduces the STRAW-b concept, covering its scientific objectives and the instrumentation used. Furthermore, it discusses the design considerations implemented to guarantee a secure and dependable deployment process of STRAW-b. Additionally, it showcases the data collected by battery-powered loggers, which monitored the mechanical stress on the equipment throughout the deployment. The report also offers an overview of STRAW-b’s operation, with a specific emphasis on the notable advancements achieved in the data acquisition (DAQ) system and its successful integration with the server infrastructure of ONC.</p>

<p>2023-10-25, <strong>Probing photon-ALP oscillations from the MAGIC observations of FSRQ QSO B1420+326</strong>, Bhanu Prakash Pant et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16634v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.16634v1</a></p>

<p>At the beginning of the year 2020, MAGIC reported a very-high-energy (VHE) flaring activity from the FSRQ QSO B1420+326. It is now the fourth known most distant blazar (z=0.682) with an observed VHE gamma-ray emission. In this work, we investigate the effect of photon-axion-like particle (ALP) oscillations in the gamma-ray spectra measured by Fermi-LAT and MAGIC around the flaring state. We set 95% confidence level (C.L.) upper limit on the ALP parameters and obtain a constraint on the photon-ALP coupling constant $g_{a\gamma} &lt; 2\times10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for ALP masses $m_{a} \sim 10^{-10}-10^{-9}$ eV. Assuming the hadronic origin of VHE photons, we also estimate the expected neutrino flux from this source and the contribution to diffuse neutrino flux from QSO B1420+326-like FSRQs at sub-PeV energies. Furthermore, we study the implications of photon-ALP oscillations on the counterpart $\gamma$-rays of the sub-PeV neutrinos. Finally, we investigate a viable scenario of invisible neutrino decay to ALPs on the gamma-ray spectra and diffuse $\gamma$-ray flux at sub-PeV energies. Interestingly, we find that for the choice of neutrino lifetime $\tau_{2}/m_{2} = 10^3$ s eV$^{-1}$, the $\gamma$-ray flux has a good observational sensitivity towards LHAASO-KM2A.</p>

<p>2023-10-25, <strong>Muon-induced background in a next-generation dark matter experiment based on liquid xenon</strong>, Viktor Pěč et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16586v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.16586v1</a></p>

<p>Muon-induced neutrons can lead to potentially irreducible backgrounds in rare event search experiments. We have investigated the implication of laboratory depth on the muon-induced background in a future dark matter experiment capable of reaching the so-called neutrino floor. Our simulation study focused on a xenon-based detector with 70 tonnes of active mass, surrounded by additional veto systems plus a water shield. Two locations at the Boulby Underground Laboratory (UK) were analysed as examples: an experimental cavern in salt at a depth of 2850 m w. e. (similar to the location of the existing laboratory), and a deeper laboratory located in polyhalite rock at a depth of 3575 m w. e. Our results show that no cosmogenic background events are likely to survive standard analysis cuts for 10 years of operation at either location. The largest background component we identified comes from beta-delayed neutron emission from $^{17}$N which is produced from $^{19}$F in the fluoropolymer components of the experiment. Our results confirm that a dark matter search with sensitivity to the neutrino floor is viable (from the point of view of cosmogenic backgrounds) in underground laboratories at these levels of rock overburden. This work was conducted in 2019-21 in the context of a feasibility study to investigate the possibility of developing the Boulby Underground Laboratory to host a next-generation dark matter experiment; however, our findings are also relevant for other underground laboratories.</p>

<p>2023-10-25, <strong>Quantum corrections and the minimal Yukawa sector of $SU(5)$</strong>, Ketan M. Patel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16563v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.16563v1</a></p>

<p>It is well-known that the $SU(5)$ grand unified theory, with the standard model quarks and leptons unified in $\overline{5}$ and $10$ and the electroweak Higgs doublet residing in $5$ dimensional representations, leads to relation, $Y_d=Y_e^T$, between the Yukawa couplings of the down-type quarks and the charged leptons. We show that this degeneracy can be lifted in a phenomenologically viable way when quantum corrections to the tree-level matching conditions are taken into account in the presence of one or more copies of gauge singlet fermions. The 1-loop threshold corrections arising from heavy leptoquark scalar and vector bosons, already present in the minimal model, and heavy singlet fermions can lead to realistic Yukawa couplings provided their masses differ by at least two orders of magnitude. The latter can also lead to a realistic light neutrino mass spectrum through the type I seesaw mechanism if the colour partner of the Higgs stays close to the Planck scale. Most importantly, our findings demonstrate the viability of the simplest Yukawa sector when quantum corrections are considered and sizeable threshold effects are present.</p>

<p>2023-10-25, <strong>The $ν_{R}$-philic scalar dark matter</strong>, Xun-Jie Xu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16346v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.16346v1</a></p>

<p>Right-handed neutrinos ($\nu_{R}$) offer an intriguing portal to new physics in hidden sectors where dark matter (DM) may reside. In this work, we delve into the simplest hidden sector involving only a real scalar exclusively coupled to $\nu_{R}$, referred to as the $\nu_{R}$-philic scalar. We investigate the viability of the $\nu_{R}$-philic scalar to serve as a DM candidate, under the constraint that the coupling of $\nu_{R}$ to the standard model is determined by the seesaw relation and is responsible for the observed DM abundance. By analyzing the DM decay channels and solving Boltzmann equations, we identify the viable parameter space. In particular, our study reveals a lower bound ($\sim10^{4}$ GeV) on the mass of $\nu_{R}$ for the $\nu_{R}$-philic scalar to be DM. The DM mass may vary from sub-keV to sub-GeV. Within the viable parameter space, monochromatic neutrino lines from DM decay can be an important signal for DM indirect detection.</p>

<p>2023-10-24, <strong>Searching for sub-populations within the gamma-ray solar flares catalog: a graph-based clustering analysis</strong>, Jonathan Mauro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16011v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.16011v1</a></p>

<p>Solar flares are highly energetic events that happen in the solar atmosphere. They are mostly observed as X-ray or gamma-ray bursts located on the Sun’s surface. While they are known to be sites of particle acceleration, the acceleration process(es) responsible for the observed fluxes remain unsure. The diversity in shape and duration of the gamma-ray fluxes suggests the existence of distinct phases of hadronic acceleration. Moreover, different acceleration processes could explain the differences observed among flares. In this work we search for the evidence of sub-populations within the catalog of gamma-ray solar flares observed by Fermi-LAT. We aim at grouping flares with similar physical properties to be able to probe theoretical models for neutrino production within different classes of flares. We use measurements of the X-ray and gamma-ray fluxes, as well as CMEs and SEPs, to cluster the events using a graph-based algorithm. Furthermore, we investigate the most representative features that characterise the identified sub-populations to allow for qualitative analysis and model development.</p>

<p>2023-10-24, <strong>Gravitational production of sterile neutrinos</strong>, Fotis Koutroulis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15906v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.15906v1</a></p>

<p>We consider gravitational production of singlet fermions such as sterile neutrinos during and after inflation. The production efficiency due to classical gravity is suppressed by the fermion mass. Quantum gravitational effects, on the other hand, are expected to break conformal invariance of the fermion sector by the Planck scale-suppressed operators irrespective of the mass. We find that such operators are very efficient in fermion production immediately after inflation, generating a significant background of stable or long-lived feebly interacting particles. This applies, in particular, to sterile neutrinos which can constitute cold non-thermal dark matter for a wide range of masses, including the keV scale.</p>

<p>2023-10-24, <strong>High-energy Neutrino Emission Associated with GWs from Binary Black Hole Mergers in AGN Accretion Discs</strong>, Zi-Hang Zhou et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15832v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.15832v1</a></p>

<p>The search for multi-messenger signals of binary black hole (BBH) mergers is crucial to understanding the merger process of BBH and the relative astrophysical environment. Considering BBH mergers occurring in the active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks, we focus on the accompanying high-energy neutrino production from the interaction between the jet launched by the post-merger remnant BH and disk materials. Particles can be accelerated by the shocks generated from the jet-disk interaction and subsequently interact with the disk gas and radiations to produce high-energy neutrinos through hadronic processes. We demonstrate that the identification of the high-energy neutrino signal from BBH merger in AGN disks is feasible. In addition, the joint BBH gravitational wave (GW) and neutrino detection rate is derived, which can be used to constrain the BBH merger rate and the accretion rate of the remnant BH based on the future associated detections of GWs and neutrinos.</p>

<p>2023-10-24, <strong>Results from SND@LHC</strong>, Ettore Zaffaroni et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15791v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.15791v1</a></p>

<p>SND@LHC is a compact and stand-alone experiment to perform measurements with neutrinos produced at the LHC in a hitherto unexplored pseudo-rapidity region of $7.2 &lt; \eta &lt; 8.4$, complementary to all the other experiments at the LHC. The experiment is located 480 m downstream of IP1 in the unused TI18 tunnel. The detector is composed of a hybrid system based on an 800 kg target mass of tungsten plates, interleaved with emulsion and electronic trackers, followed downstream by a calorimeter and a muon system. The configuration allows efficiently distinguishing between all three neutrino flavours, opening a unique opportunity to probe physics of heavy flavour production at the LHC in the region that is not accessible to ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. SND@LHC has started taking data in 2022 and in this work the direct observation of muon neutrino interaction in the detector is reported.</p>

<p>2023-10-24, <strong>IceCube – Neutrinos in Deep Ice The Top 3 Solutions from the Public Kaggle Competition</strong>, Habib Bukhari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15674v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.15674v1</a></p>

<p>During the public Kaggle competition “IceCube – Neutrinos in Deep Ice”, thousands of reconstruction algorithms were created and submitted, aiming to estimate the direction of neutrino events recorded by the IceCube detector. Here we describe in detail the three ultimate best, award-winning solutions. The data handling, architecture, and training process of each of these machine learning models is laid out, followed up by an in-depth comparison of the performance on the kaggle datatset. We show that on cascade events in IceCube above 10 TeV, the best kaggle solution is able to achieve an angular resolution of better than 5 degrees, and for tracks correspondingly better than 0.5 degrees. These performance measures compare favourably to the current state-of-the-art in the field.</p>

<p>2023-10-24, <strong>Longitudinal kinematic imbalances in (anti-)neutrino interactions for improved measurements of nuclear removal energies and the axial vector form factor</strong>, Nathan Baudis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15633v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.15633v1</a></p>

<p>Current and future accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments require an improved understanding of nuclear effects in neutrino-nucleus interactions. One important systematic uncertainty is given by potential mismodeling of the removal energy, which biases the reconstruction of the neutrino energy. In this manuscript, we introduce a novel observable for accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments, the visible longitudinal momentum imbalance, reconstructed in charged current quasi-elastic interactions from the outgoing charged lepton and nucleon. Minimally dependent on the neutrino energy and directly sensitive to the removal energy distribution, we demonstrate a method to constrain the latter. Further, we show how the use of the longitudinal imbalance in anti-neutrino interactions in a target containing hydrogen allows for an improved, high-purity selection of the interactions on hydrogen. This approach offers the potential for precise measurements of the nuclear axial vector form factor as well as of the anti-neutrino flux.</p>

<p>2023-10-24, <strong>The abundance of dark matter haloes down to Earth mass</strong>, Haonan Zheng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16093v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.16093v1</a></p>

<p>We use the Voids-within-Voids-within-Voids (VVV) simulations, a suite of successive nested N-body simulations with extremely high resolution (denoted, from low to high resolution, by L0 to L7), to test the Press-Schechter (PS), Sheth-Tormen (ST), and extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formulae for the halo abundance over the entire mass range, from mini-haloes of $10^{-6}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$, to rich cluster haloes of $10^{15}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$, at different redshifts, from $z=30$ to the present. We find that at $z=0$ and $z=2$, ST gives the best prediction for the results of L0, which has the mean cosmic density (i.e. overdensity $\delta=0$), at $10^{11-15} ~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. The higher resolution levels (L1-L7) are biased regions at various underdensities ($\delta&lt;-0.6$). The EPS formalism takes this into account since it gives the mass function of a region conditioned, in this case, on having a given underdensity. The EPS gives good predictions for these higher levels, with deviations $\lesssim 20\%$, at $10^{-6-12.5} ~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. At $z \sim 7-15$, the ST predictions for L0 and the EPS predictions for L1-L7 show somewhat larger deviations from the simulation results. However, at even higher redshifts, $z \sim 30$, the EPS prediction fits the simulations well again. We further confirm our results by picking more subvolumes from the full L0 simulation, finding that our conclusions depend only weakly on the size and overdensity of the chosen region. Since at mean density the EPS reduces to the PS mass function, its good agreement with the higher-level simulations implies that the PS (or, even better, the ST) formula gives an accurate description of the total halo mass function in representative regions of the universe.</p>

<p>2023-10-24, <strong>Extending preferred axion models via heavy-quark induced early matter domination</strong>, Andrew Cheek et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16087v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.16087v1</a></p>

<p>We examine the cosmological consequences of the heavy quarks in KSVZ-type axion models. We find that their presence often causes an early matter domination phase, altering the evolution of the Universe. This extends the axion mass into the region where standard cosmology leads to overproduction, and allows for a greater number of axion models with non-renormalizable terms to be viable. Quantitatively, we find that decays proceeding through effective terms of up to dimension 9 ($d=9$) remain consistent with cosmological constraints, in contrast with the result $d\leq5$ previously found in the literature. As a consequence, the heavy quarks can be much heavier and the axion mass window with the correct relic density for dark matter is extended by orders of magnitude, down to $m_a\approx 6\times 10^{-9} \,{\rm eV}$. This is achieved without resorting to fine-tuning of the initial misalignment angle, bolstering the motivation for many future axion haloscope experiments. Additionally, we explore how these models can be probed through measurements of the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at recombination.</p>

<p>2023-10-24, <strong>Experimental measurement of the quality factor of a Fabry-Pérot open-cavity axion haloscope</strong>, Juan F. Hernández-Cabrera et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16013v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.16013v1</a></p>

<p>The axion is a hypothetical boson arising from the most natural solution to the problem of charge and parity symmetry in the strong nuclear force. Moreover, this pseudoscalar emerges as a dark matter candidate in a parameter space extending several decades in mass. The Dark-photons \&amp; Axion-Like particles Interferometer (DALI) is a proposal to search for axion dark matter in a range that remains under-examined. Currently in a design and prototyping phase, this haloscope is a multilayer Fabry-P'erot interferometer. A proof-of-principle experiment is performed to observe the resonance in a prototype. The test unveils a quality factor per open cavity of a few hundred over a bandwidth of the order of dozens of megahertz. The result elucidates a physics potential to find the, so far elusive, axion, in a sector which can simultaneously solve the symmetry problem in the strong interaction and the enigma of dark matter.</p>

<p>Gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations provide a rather useful tool to explore the evolution of the universe. In this work, we wish to investigate whether the dark sirens with neutron star (NS) deformation from third-generation (3G) GW detectors could help probe the interaction between dark energy and dark matter. We simulate the GW dark sirens of four detection strategies based on the three-year observation and consider four phenomenological interacting dark energy models to perform cosmological analysis. We find that GW dark sirens could provide tight constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $H_0$ in the four IDE models, but perform not well in constraining the dimensionless coupling parameter $\beta$ with the interaction proportional to the energy density of cold dark matter. Nevertheless, the parameter degeneracy orientations of CMB and GW are almost orthogonal, and thus the combination of them could effectively break cosmological parameter degeneracies, with the constraint errors of $\beta$ being 0.00068-0.018. In addition, we choose three typical equation of states (EoSs) of NS, i.e., SLy, MPA1, and MS1, to investigate the effect of NS’s EoS in cosmological analysis. The stiffer EoS could give tighter constraints than the softer EoS. Nonetheless, the combination of CMB and GW dark sirens (using different EoSs of NS) shows basically the same constraint results of cosmological parameters. We conclude that the dark sirens from 3G GW detectors would play a crucial role in helping probe the interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and the CMB+GW results are basically not affected by the EoS of NS.</p>

<p>2023-10-24, <strong>Temperature profiles of galactic dark matter halos</strong>, Andrés Aceña et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15795v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.15795v1</a></p>

<p>We present the temperature profiles of galactic dark matter halos by considering that dark matter can be treated as a classical ideal gas, as an ideal Fermi gas, or as an ideal Bose gas. The only free parameter in the matter model is the mass of the dark matter particle. We obtain the temperature profiles by using the rotational velocity profile proposed by Persic, Salucci, and Stel (1996) and assuming that the dark matter halo is a self-gravitating stand-alone structure. From the temperature profiles, we conclude that the classical ideal gas and the ideal Fermi gas are not viable explanations for dark matter, while the ideal Bose gas is if the mass of the particle is low enough. If we take into account the relationship presented by Donato et al. (2009) and Gentile et al. (2009) between central density and core radius then we conclude that the central temperature of dark matter in all galaxies is the same. Also, the dark matter halo is in a state of Bose-Einstein condensation, or at least the central region is. By using fittings of observational data, we can put an upper bound on the dark matter particle mass in the order of $13\,eV/c^2$.</p>

<p>2023-10-24, <strong>The Tully-Fisher relation and the Bosma effect</strong>, Francesco Sylos Labini et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15673v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.15673v1</a></p>

<p>We show that the rotation curves of 16 nearby disc galaxies in the THINGS sample and the Milky Way can be described by the NFW halo model and by the Bosma effect at approximately the same level of accuracy. The latter effect suggests that the behavior of the rotation curve at large radii is determined by the rescaled gas component and thus that dark matter and gas distributions are tightly correlated. By focusing on galaxies with exponential decay in their gas surface density, we can normalize their rotation curves to match the exponential thin disc model at large enough radii. This normalization assumes that the galaxy mass is estimated consistently within this model, assuming a thin disc structure. We show that this rescaling allows us to derive a new version of the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation, the Bosma TF relation that nicely fit the data. In the framework of this model, the connection between the Bosma Tully-Fisher (TF) relation and the baryonic TF relation can be established by considering an additional empirical relation between the baryonic mass and the total mass of the disc, as measured in the data.</p>

<p>The 21-cm signal from the dark ages is a powerful tool for fundamental cosmology and for probing new physics. While it can be used for precision measurements within standard cosmology, here we study two non-standard models: an excess radio background (ERB) model (possibly generated by dark matter decay) and the millicharged dark matter (mDM) model. These models were inspired by the possible EDGES detection of a strong global 21-cm absorption during cosmic dawn, but more generally they provide a way to anticipate the potential discovery space. We find that during the dark ages the 21-cm global signal in the ERB model reaches a saturated form for an amplitude $A_{\rm r}=0.4$, where $A_{\rm r}$ is the radio background intensity at cosmic dawn relative to the cosmic microwave background. This amplitude is one fifth of the minimum required to explain the EDGES signal, and corresponds to just 0.1\% of the observed extragalactic background; it would give a signal that can be detected at 5.9$\sigma$ significance (compared to 4.1$\sigma$ for the standard signal) and distinguished from the standard (no ERB) signal at 8.5$\sigma$, all with a 1,000 hour global signal measurement. A lower $A_{\rm r}=0.039$ could be distinguished at 5$\sigma$. The 21-cm power spectrum has potentially much more information, but far greater resources would be required for comparable constraints on the ERB signal. For the mDM model, over a range of viable parameters, the global signal detection significance would be $4.7-7.2\,\sigma$, and it could be distinguished from standard at $2.2-9.3\,\sigma$. With an array of global signal antennas achieving an effective 100,000 hr integration, the significance would be 10$\times$ better. Our analysis helps motivate the development of lunar and space-based dark ages experiments.</p>

<p>2023-10-25, <strong>The runaway velocity of the white dwarf companion in the double detonation scenario of supernovae</strong>, Jessica Braudo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16554v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.16554v1</a></p>

<p>We consider the finite velocity of the ejecta of a type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in the double detonation (DDet) scenario with a white dwarf (WD) mass-donor companion, and find that the runaway velocity of the surviving (mass donor) WD is lower than its pre-explosion orbital velocity by about 8-11 %. This implies that the fastest runaway WDs in the Galaxy, if come from the DDet scenario, require even more massive WDs than what a simple calculation that neglects the finite ejecta velocity gives. This extreme set of initial conditions makes such binaries less common. We also tentatively find that the inner ejecta largely deviate from spherical symmetry, unlike observed SN Ia remnants. We argue that these findings support the claim that the DDet scenario leads mostly to peculiar SNe Ia but not to normal SNe Ia.</p>

<p>We present new and archival Australia Telescope Compact Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data of the Small Magellanic Cloud supernova remnant 1E 0102.2-7219 at 2100, 5500, 9000, and 108000 MHz; as well as Hi data provided by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder. The remnant shows a ring-like morphology with a mean radius of 6.2 pc. The 5500 MHz image reveals a bridge-like structure, seen for the first time in a radio image. This structure is also visible in both optical and X-ray images. In the 9000 MHz image we detect a central feature that has a flux density of 4.3 mJy but rule out a pulsar wind nebula origin, due to the lack of significant polarisation towards the central feature with an upper limit of 4 per cent. The mean fractional polarisation for 1E 0102.2-7219 is 7 +- 1 and 12 +- 2 per cent for 5500 and 9000 MHz, respectively. The spectral index for the entire remnant is -0.61 +- 0.01. We estimate the line-of-sight magnetic field strength in the direction of 1E 0102.2-7219 of ~44 microG with an equipartition field of 65 +- 5 microG. This latter model, uses the minimum energy of the sum of the magnetic field and cosmic ray electrons only. We detect an Hi cloud towards this remnant at the velocity range of ~160-180 km s-1 and a cavity-like structure at the velocity of 163.7-167.6 km s-1. We do not detect CO emission towards 1E 0102.2-7219.</p>

<p>2023-10-25, <strong>Joint Constraints on the Hubble Constant, Spatial Curvature, and Sound Horizon from the Late-time Universe with Cosmography</strong>, Kaituo Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16512v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.16512v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, using the latest Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and observational Hubble data (OHD), we carry out a joint constraint on the Hubble constant $H_0$, the spatial curvature $\Omega_{\rm K}$, and the sound horizon at the end of drag epoch $r_{\rm d}$. To be model-independent, four cosmography models, i.e., the Taylor series in terms of redshift $y_1=z/(1+z)$, $y_2=\arctan(z)$, $y_3=\ln(1+z)$, and the Pad'e approximants, are used without the assumption of flat Universe. The results show that the $H_0$ is anti-correlated with $\Omega_{\rm K}$ and $r_{\rm d}$, indicating smaller $\Omega_{\rm K}$ or $r_{\rm d}$ would be helpful in alleviating the Hubble tension. And the values of $H_0$ and $r_{\rm d}$ are consistent with the estimate derived from the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data based on the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, but $H_0$ is in 2.3$\sim$3.0$\sigma$ tension with that obtained by \cite{Riess2022} in all these cosmographic approaches. Meanwhile, a flat Universe is preferred by the present observations under all approximations except the third order of $y_1$ and $y_2$ of the Taylor series. Furthermore, according to the values of the Bayesian evidence, we found that the flat $\Lambda$CDM remains to be the most favored model by the joint datasets, and the Pad'e approximant of order (2,2), the third order of $y_3$ and $y_1$ are the top three cosmographic expansions that fit the datasets best, while the Taylor series in terms of $y_2$ are essentially ruled out.</p>

<p>2023-10-25, <strong>The effects of Thomson scattering and chemical mixing on early-time light curves of double peaked type IIb supernovae</strong>, Seong Hyun Park et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16328v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.16328v1</a></p>

<p>Previous numerical simulations of double-peaked SNe IIb light curves have demonstrated that the radius and mass of the hydrogen-rich envelope of the progenitor star can significantly influence the brightness and timescale of the early-time light curve around the first peak. In this study, we investigate how Thomson scattering and chemical mixing in the SN ejecta affect the optical light curves during the early stages of the SNe IIb using radiation hydrodynamics simulations. By comparing the results from two different numerical codes (i.e., \stella{} and \snec{}), we find that the optical brightness of the first peak can be reduced by more than a factor of 3 due to the effect of Thomson scattering that causes the thermalization depth to be located below the Rosseland-mean photosphere, compared to the corresponding case where this effect is ignored. We also observe a short-lived plateau-like feature lasting for a few days in the early-time optical light curves of our models, in contrast to typical observed SNe IIb that show a quasi-linear decrease in optical magnitudes after the first peak. A significant degree of chemical mixing between the hydrogen-rich envelope and the helium core in SN ejecta is required to reconcile this discrepancy between the model prediction and observation. Meanwhile, to properly reproduce the first peak, a significant mixing of \nifs{} into the hydrogen-rich outermost layers should be restricted. Our findings indicate that inferring the SN IIb progenitor structure from a simplified approach that ignores these two factors may introduce substantial uncertainty.</p>

<p>2023-10-24, <strong>SN 2022jox: An extraordinarily ordinary Type II SN with Flash Spectroscopy</strong>, Jennifer E. Andrews et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16092v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.16092v1</a></p>

<p>We present high cadence optical and ultraviolet observations of the Type II supernova (SN), SN 2022jox which exhibits early spectroscopic high ionization flash features of \ion{H}{1}, \ion{He}{2}, \ion{C}{4}, and \ion{N}{4} that disappear within the first few days after explosion. SN 2022jox was discovered by the Distance Less than 40 Mpc (DLT40) survey $\sim$0.75 days after explosion with followup spectra and UV photometry obtained within minutes of discovery. The SN reached a peak brightness of M$_V \sim$ $-$17.3 mag, and has an estimated $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.04 M$_{\odot}$, typical values for normal Type II SNe. The modeling of the early lightcurve and the strong flash signatures present in the optical spectra indicate interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) created from a progenitor with a mass loss rate of $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}\ M_\odot\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. There may also be some indication of late-time CSM interaction in the form of an emission line blueward of H$\alpha$ seen in spectra around 200 days. The mass-loss rate is much higher than the values typically associated with quiescent mass loss from red supergiants, the known progenitors of Type II SNe, but is comparable to inferred values from similar core collapse SNe with flash features, suggesting an eruptive event or a superwind in the progenitor in the months or years before explosion.</p>

<p>2023-10-24, <strong>Physical Properties of 5,000 Cool LMC Supergiants with Gaia XP Spectra: A Detailed Portrait of the Upper HR Diagram Hints at Missing Supernova Progenitors</strong>, Trevor Z. Dorn-Wallenstein et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16088v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.16088v1</a></p>

<p>Characterizing the physical properties of cool supergiants allows us to probe the final stages of a massive star’s evolution before it undergoes core collapse. Despite their importance, the fundamental properties for these stars – $T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log L/L_\odot$ – are only known for a limited number of objects. The third data release of the Gaia mission contains precise photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy of hundreds of cool supergiants in the LMC with well-constrained properties. Using these data, we train a simple and easily-interpretable machine learning model to regress effective temperatures and luminosities with high accuracy and precision comparable to the training data. We then apply our model to 5000 cool supergiants, many of which have no previously-published $T_{\rm eff}$ or $L$ estimates. The resulting Hertzprung-Russell diagram is well-populated, allowing us to study the distribution of cool supergiants in great detail. Examining the luminosity functions of our sample, we find a notable flattening in the luminosity function of yellow supergiants above $\log L/L_\odot=5$, and a corresponding steepening of the red supergiant luminosity function. We place this finding in context with previous results, and present its implications for the infamous red supergiant problem.</p>

<p>2023-10-24, <strong>Violent mass ejection by the progenitors of the brightest planetary nebulae: supernova progenitors</strong>, Noam Soker et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15785v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.15785v1</a></p>

<p>I examine the morphologies of the brightest planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Milky Way Galaxy and conclude that violent binary interaction processes eject the main nebulae of the brightest PNe. The typical morphologies of the brightest PNe are multipolar, namely have been shaped by two or more major jet-launching episodes at varying directions, and possess small to medium departures from pure point-symmetry. The departure from pure point-symmetry is generally not large. This suggests that triple-star interaction is not behind the mass ejection process, but rather a violent binary interaction. By violent interaction I refer to two or more energetic jet-launching episodes within a relatively short time (much shorter than the PN formation time). In particular, I suggest that the timescales of some interactions are shorter than the dynamical timescale of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) progenitor. I discuss some possibilities, including a rapid onset of the common envelope evolution (CEE) and the merger of the companion with the AGB core at the termination of the CEE. I suggest that the most likely companions to experience such interactions are white dwarfs (WDs). Some of these might actually be progenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), as I suggest for SNR G1.9+0.3, the youngest SN Ia in the Galaxy. I speculate here on a positive correlation (but not one-to-one correspondence) between the brightest PNe and cases of CEE that end with WD-core merger, including progenitors of some SNe Ia.</p>

<p>2023-10-24, <strong>Supernova Ejecta with Crystalline Silicate Dust in the Supernova Remnant MSH 15-52</strong>, Hyun-Jeong Kim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15733v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.15733v1</a></p>

<p>IRAS 15099-5856 in the young supernova remnant (SNR) MSH 15-52 is the first and only SNR-associated object with crystalline silicate dust detected so far, although its nature and the origin of the crystalline silicate are still unclear. In this paper, we present high-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) imaging observations of the bright central compact source IRS1 of IRAS 15099-5856 to study the spatial distributions of gas and dust and the analysis of its Spitzer MIR spectrum to explore the origin of IRS1. The MIR images obtained with the T-ReCS attached on the Gemini South telescope show a complicated, inhomogeneous morphology of IRS1 with bright clumps and diffuse emission in [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m and Qa 18.30 $\mu$m, which confirms that IRS1 is an extended source externally heated by the nearby O star Muzzio 10, a candidate for the binary companion of the progenitor star. The Spitzer MIR spectrum reveals several ionic emission lines including a strong [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m line, but no hydrogen line is detected. We model the spectrum using the photoionization code CLOUDY with varying elemental composition. The elemental abundance of IRS1 derived from the model is close to that of SN ejecta with depleted hydrogen and enhanced metals, particularly neon, argon, and iron. Our results imply that IRS1 originates from the SN ejecta and suggest the possibility of the formation of crystalline silicate in newly-formed SN dust.</p>

<p>Core-collapse supernovae are sources of powerful gravitational waves (GWs). We assess the possibility of extracting information about the equation of state (EOS) of high density matter from the GW signal. We use the bounce and early post-bounce signals of rapidly rotating supernovae. A large set of GW signals is generated using general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations for various EOS models. The uncertainty in the electron capture rate is parametrized by generating signals for six different models. To classify EOSs based on the GW data, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Even with the uncertainty in the electron capture rates, we find that the CNN models can classify the EOSs with an average accuracy of about 87 percent for a set of four distinct EOS models.</p>

<p>2023-10-24, <strong>Contribution to Galactic cosmic rays from young stellar clusters</strong>, G. Morlino et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15640v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.15640v1</a></p>

<p>The origin of Galactic cosmic rays (CR) is still a matter of debate. Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) applied to supernova remnant (SNR) shocks provides the most reliable explanation. However, within the current understanding of DSA several issues remain unsolved, like the CR maximum energy, the chemical composition and the transition region between Galactic and extra-Galactic CRs. These issues motivate the search for other possible Galactic sources. Recently, several young stellar clusters (YSC) have been detected in gamma rays, suggesting that such objects could be powerful sources of Galactic CRs. The energy input could come from winds of massive stars hosted in the clusters which is a function of the cluster total mass and initial mass function of stars. In this work we evaluate the total CR flux produced by a synthetic population of YSCs assuming that the CR acceleration occurs at the termination shock of the collective wind resulting from the sum of cluster’s stellar winds. We show that the spectrum produced by YSC can significantly contribute to energies $\gtrsim 100$ TeV if the diffusion inside the wind-blown bubble is Bohm-like and the spectral slope is harder than the one produced by SNRs.</p>
