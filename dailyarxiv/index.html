<p>2025-01-21, <strong>ESSnuSB status</strong>, George Fanourakis et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12297v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12297v1</a></p>

<p>ESSnuSB (the European Spallation neutrino Super Beam) is a design study for a long-baseline neutrino experiment to precisely measure the CP violation in the leptonic sector, at the second neutrino oscillation maximum, using a beam driven by the uniquely powerful ESS linear accelerator. The ESSnuSB CDR showed that after 10 years, about 72% of the possible CP violating phase range will be covered with 5 sigma C.L. to reject the no CP violation hypothesis. The expected precision for the CP violating phase is better than 8 degrees for all allowed values, making it the most precise proposed experiment in the field. The extension project, ESSnuSB+, aims in designing two new facilities, a Low Energy nuSTORM and a Low Energy Monitored Neutrino Beam to use them to precisely measure the neutrino-nucleus cross-section in the energy range of 0.2 to 0.6 GeV. A new water Cherenkov detector will also be designed to measure cross sections and serve to explore the sterile neutrino case.</p>

<p>2025-01-21, <strong>Constraint on Neutrino Statistics from Cosmological Data</strong>, YiCheng Dai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12264v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12264v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the impact of neutrino statistical property on cosmology and the constraints imposed by cosmological data on neutrino statistics. Cosmological data from probes such as Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) radiation and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation(BAO) are used to constrain the statistical parameter of neutrino. This constraint is closely related to the degeneracy effects among neutrino statistical property, the sum of neutrino masses, and the Hubble constant. Our results show that purely bosonic neutrinos can be ruled out at 95\% confidence level and purely fermionic neutrinos are preferred.</p>

<p>2025-01-21, <strong>Probing Type II Seesaw Leptogenesis Through Lepton Flavor Violation</strong>, Chengcheng Han et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12184v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12184v1</a></p>

<p>Lepton flavor violation (LFV) offers a powerful probe of physics beyond the Standard Model, particularly in models addressing neutrino masses and the baryon asymmetry of the universe. In this study, we investigate LFV processes within the framework of type II seesaw leptogenesis, where the Standard Model is extended by an $SU(2)_L$ triplet Higgs field. We focus on key LFV processes including $\mu^+\to e^+\gamma$, $\mu^+ \to e^+e^-e^+$, and $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion in nuclei, deriving stringent constraints on the parameter space from current experimental data. We scan the 3$\sigma$ range of neutrino oscillation parameters and identify the most conservative bounds consistent with existing measurements. Our results reveal that the MEG experiment currently provides the strongest constraints in the normal ordering (NO) scenario, while the SINDRUM experiment offers comparable sensitivity in the inverted ordering (IO) case. Future experiments, such as MEG II, Mu3e, Mu2e, and COMET, are predicted to significantly improve the sensitivity, testing larger regions of the parameter space. This work underscores the crucial role of LFV experiments in probing type II seesaw leptogenesis, providing an avenue to explore the connections between neutrino mass generation, baryogenesis, and inflation at experimentally accessible energy scales.</p>

<p>2025-01-21, <strong>Muon-specific two-Higgs-doublet model for $(g-2)_μ$ anomaly, $W$-boson mass-shift, and Zee model</strong>, I. A. Yafi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12181v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12181v2</a></p>

<p>We have investigated one type of 2HDM, the muon-specific two-Higgs-doublet model, as a solution to the muon ($g-2$) and CDF $W$-boson mass anomaly. The additional Higgs boson couplings to muons are enhanced by $\tan \beta$, while the couplings to other fermions are suppressed by $\cot \beta$. One-loop corrections to the $W-\mu-\nu_\mu$ coupling induce a positive shift to the $W$-boson mass, compatible with the CDF measurement. Fixing the charged Higgs mass of $m_{H^\pm}=600$ GeV, our results show that small values of $\tan \beta$ ($\approx 200$) require a large mass splitting of $m_A-m_H \approx 480$ GeV. The small mass splitting case $m_A-m_H \approx 10$ GeV is also possible, provided large $\tan \beta$ ($\approx 5000$). The oblique parameter lies in $T=[0.126,0.198]$ which corresponds to the mass-splitting between the charged and pseudoscalar Higgs in the range typically $10-100$ GeV. This leads to the constrained all Higgs boson masses that cannot be heavier than about 600 GeV. At the end, we also have studied the model in the context of the Zee model, radiative neutrino mass generation at one-loop level, by adding a singly-charged scalar to the model. The model results in the incompatible neutrino mass matrix with solar and KamLAND data.</p>

<p>2025-01-21, <strong>Flavor-Dependent Long-Range Neutrino Interactions in DUNE and T2HK: Synergy Breeds Power</strong>, Masoom Singh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12171v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12171v1</a></p>

<p>Discovering new neutrino interactions would provide evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model. We focus on flavor-dependent long-range neutrino interactions mediated by ultra-light mediators (masses below $10^{-10}$ eV) from lepton-number gauge symmetries $L_e-L_\mu$, $L_e-L_\tau$, and $L_\mu-L_\tau$. These interactions, sourced by electrons and neutrons in the Earth, Moon, Sun, Milky Way, and the local Universe, could modify neutrino oscillation probabilities. The upcoming long-baseline experiments, DUNE and T2HK, with their large statistics, reduced systematic uncertainties, and well-characterized neutrino beams, will probe these interactions. We forecast that, while individually DUNE and T2HK could constrain these long-range neutrino interactions, their combination lifts parameter degeneracies that weaken individual sensitivity and provides stronger constraints.</p>

<p>2025-01-21, <strong>Boosted dark matter from semi-annihilations in the Galactic Center</strong>, Boris Betancourt Kamenetskaia et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12117v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12117v1</a></p>

<p>In some scenarios, the dark matter relic abundance is set by the semi-annihilation of two dark matter particles into one dark matter particle and one Standard Model particle. These semi-annihilations might still be occurring today in the Galactic Center at a significant rate, generating a flux of boosted dark matter particles. We investigate the possible signals of this flux component in direct detection and neutrino experiments for sub-GeV dark matter masses. We show that for typical values of the semi-annihilation cross-section, the sensitivity of current experiments to the spin-independent dark matter-proton scattering cross-section can be several orders of magnitude larger than current constraints from cosmic-ray boosted dark matter. We also argue that the upcoming DARWIN and DUNE experiments may probe scattering cross-sections as low as $10^{-37}\,{\rm cm}^2$ for masses between 30 MeV and 1 GeV.</p>

<p>2025-01-21, <strong>Gravitational waves and primordial black holes from the T-model inflation with Gauss-Bonnet correction</strong>, Peng-Bo Chen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12242v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12242v1</a></p>

<p>Recently, the worldwide Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations detected a stochastic gravitational wave(GW) background in the nanohertz range, which may originate from the early universe’s inflationary phase. So in this work, we investigated induce GWs in the T-model inflation with Gauss-Bonnet coupling. Consider the scenario of traversing a domain wall in moduli space, we take the coupling coefficient to be an approximately step function. Within suitable parameter regions, the model exhibits de Sitter fixed points, which allows inflation to undergo an ultra-slow-roll phase, which causes the power spectrum to exhibit a peak. Such a peak can induce nanohertz GWs, which provids an explanation for the PTA observational data. Furthermore, we consider the case of multiple domain wall crossings, and adopting a double-step coupling function. In this case, the resulting GW spectrum has two peaks with frequencies around (10^{-8} \,\text{Hz}) and (10^{-2}\,\text{Hz}), respectively. Which can be observed by the PTA and the space GW detectors simultaneously.Additionally, the reentry of the power spectrum peaks into the horizon leads to the collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs). We calculate the abundance of PBHs and found that the masses is in the range of (10^{-14} \sim 10^{-13} M_\odot) and around (10^{-2} M_\odot) , which constitute significant components of the current dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-01-21, <strong>Black holes surrounded by dark matter spike: spacetime metrics and gravitational wave ringdown waveforms</strong>, Dong Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12213v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12213v1</a></p>

<p>The black holes at the centers of galaxies may be surrounded by dark matter spike, which could leave detectable imprints on the gravitational wave signals they emit. In this work, combining the mass model of M87 and the black hole solutions derived from the TOV equations, we focus on the gravitational wave ringdown waveforms of the black holes under the axial gravitational perturbation using the continued fraction method, that is quasinormal modes, and compare them with the Schwarzschild black hole. Furthermore, the impact of the different dark matter parameters on the quasinormal frequencies of the black holes was also investigated. In particular, we found that the impact of dark matter spike on the quasinormal modes of the black holes can reach up to the order of $10^{-4}$. These results may provide some help in further exploring the impact of dark matter spike on the black holes and their related gravitational wave phenomena.</p>

<p>2025-01-21, <strong>The Light Neutralino Dark Matter in the Generalized Minimal Supergravity (GmSUGRA)</strong>, Imtiaz Khan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12039v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12039v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate both the $Z$ and $H$ poles solutions for the Higgsino mass parameter $\mu&gt;0$ and $\mu&lt;0$ for the neutralino dark matter in light of the LHC supersymmetry searches and the direct detection dark matter experiments, LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), in the Generalized Minimal Supergravity (GmSUGRA). Our study indicates that the latest experimental constraints from the LHC and LZ Collaborations exclude the light Higgsinos in the $Z$ and $H$ pole regions for the $\mu&gt;0$ case. Interestingly, for the $\mu &lt; 0$ case, a very light Higgsinos can still be consistent with the current constraints from the electroweakino searches and LZ experiment in the $Z$ and $H$ poles. Consequently, the $\mu &lt; 0$ case appears more promising and thus requires the dedicated efforts to make definitive conclusions about their current status from the experimental Collaborations. In this framework, our findings indicate a deviation of up to $2\sigma$ from the central value of ( a_\mu \equiv (g-2)_\mu/2 ), resonating with the experimental results reported by CMD and BDM.</p>

<p>2025-01-21, <strong>Probing Dark Star Parameters Through $f$-Mode Gravitational Wave Signals</strong>, Mariachiara Celato et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12031v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12031v1</a></p>

<p>Theoretical models of self-interacting dark matter offer a promising solution to several unresolved issues within the collisionless cold dark matter framework. For asymmetric dark matter, these self-interactions may encourage gravitational collapse, potentially leading to the creation of compact objects primarily composed of dark matter. By considering both fermionic and bosonic equations of state, we analyze the equilibrium structure of non-rotating dark stars, examining their bulk properties and comparing them with baryonic neutron stars. We show that the frequency and damping rate of $f$-mode oscillations of dark compact stars can be expressed in terms of universal functions of stellar mass, radius and moment of inertia. Finally, by employing the universality in the $f$-mode, we propose a scheme to infer accurate values of the physical parameters of dark compact stars from their $f$-mode gravitational wave signal.</p>

<p>2025-01-21, <strong>Broadband, Dead-Time-Free Spectrometer Using RFSoC for WISP Dark Matter Searches</strong>, Hiroki Takeuchi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12003v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12003v1</a></p>

<p>Ultra-light dark matter candidates, such as axions and dark photons, particularly within the mass range of $\mu$eV to meV, have garnered significant research interest. However, the effectiveness of existing experiments is often hindered by the narrow bandwidths of conventional spectrometers. This study presents a novel spectrometer solution based on a RFSoC, which integrates a high-speed data converter, field programmable gate array (FPGA), and a CPU within a single chip. The spectrometer’s programmable logic implements an optimized fast Fourier transform (FFT) that minimizes memory usage, enabling an instantaneous bandwidth of 4 GHz with a frequency resolution of 16 kHz. This configuration achieves more than 99.6% time efficiency, effectively doubling search efficiency, compared with traditional approaches. This paper provides a comprehensive description of the hardware architecture, FPGA firmware, and software implementation, with a focus on the resource-efficient pipelined FFT algorithm. Performance validation results are also presented, demonstrating the accuracy and time efficiency of the developed spectrometer, highlighting its potential for advancing dark matter search.</p>

<p>2025-01-21, <strong>Direct N-body simulations of NGC 6397 and its tidal tails</strong>, Anthony D. Arnold et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11806v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.11806v1</a></p>

<p>We have performed a series of direct N-body simulations that study the evolution of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6397 under the combined influence of two-body relaxation, stellar evolution and the Milky Way’s tidal field. Our simulations follow the evolution of the cluster over the last several Gyr up to its present-day position in the Milky Way in order to allow us to derive present-day cluster parameters and the distribution of its extra-tidal stars. We have also determined a new density profile of NGC 6397 by selecting stars from Gaia DR3 using Gaia DR3 proper motions, parallaxes and photometry to discriminate cluster members from non-members. This allows us to derive the surface density profile of NGC 6397 and the location of its tidal tails up to 10 degrees of the cluster centre, well beyond the tidal radius of NGC 6397. Our results show that the current state of NGC 6397 in terms of surface density, velocity dispersion profile and stellar mass function can be matched by a cluster model evolving from a standard initial mass function and does not require an additional central cluster of dark remnants. We also find good agreement in the location and absolute number of the extra-tidal stars between our simulations and the observations, making it unlikely that NGC 6397 is surrounded by a dark matter halo.</p>

<p>2025-01-21, <strong>Supernova constraints on lepton flavor violating ALPs</strong>, Yonglin Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12075v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2501.12075v1</a></p>

<p>Supernovae are extreme astrophysical objects that provide unique hot and dense environment to probe new physics beyond the Standard Model. We study supernova cooling constraints on lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axion-like particles (ALPs) with an electron-muon coupling. We consider three ALP production channels in the SN core: muon decay, axion bremsstrahlung, and electron-muon coalescence. We find that the electron-muon coalescence channel, which was not considered in previous studies on LFV-ALPs, provides the most stringent constraints on the LFV coupling in the mass range of $\sim (115,280)$ MeV.</p>
