<p>2024-05-15, <strong>Constraining UV freeze-in of light relics with current and next-generation CMB observations</strong>, Luca Caloni et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09449v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.09449v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmological observations allow to measure the abundance of light relics produced in the early Universe. Most studies focus on the thermal freeze-out scenario, yet light relics produced by freeze-in are generic for models in which new light degrees of freedom do not couple strongly enough to the Standard Model (SM) plasma to allow for full thermalization in the early Universe. In ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in scenarios, rates for light relic production associated with non-renormalizable interactions typical of beyond the SM (BSM) models grow with temperature more quickly than the Hubble rate. Thus, relatively small couplings to the SM can be probed by current and next-generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We investigate several representative benchmark BSM models, such as axion-like particles from Primakoff production, massless dark photons and light right-handed neutrinos. We calculate contributions to the effective number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, in corners of parameter space not previously considered and discuss the sensitivity of CMB experiments compared to other probes. In contrast to freeze-out scenarios, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ from UV freeze-in is more dependent on both the specific BSM physics model and the reheating temperature. Depending on the details of the BSM scenario, we find that the sensitivity of next-generation CMB experiments can complement or surpass the current astrophysical, laboratory or collider constraints on the couplings of the SM to the light relic.</p>

<p>2024-05-15, <strong>Refined determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy</strong>, M. Atzori Corona et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09416v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.09416v1</a></p>

<p>The weak mixing angle is a fundamental parameter of the electroweak theory of the standard model whose measurement in the low-energy regime is still not precisely determined. Different probes are sensitive to its value, among which atomic parity violation, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering and parity-violating electron scattering on different nuclei. In this work, we attempt for the first time to combine all these various determinations by performing a global fit that also keeps into account the unavoidable dependence on the experimentally poorly known neutron distribution radius of the nuclei employed, for which a new measurement using proton-cesium elastic scattering became available. By using all present direct determinations of the neutron distribution radius of cesium we find $\sin^2!\vartheta_{W} =0.2396^{+0.0020}_{-0.0019}$, which should supersede the previous value determined from atomic parity violation on cesium. When including electroweak only, but also indirect, determinations of the neutron distribution radius of cesium the uncertainty reduces to 0.0017 maintaining the same central value, showing an excellent agreement independently of the method used.</p>

<p>2024-05-15, <strong>Tri-resonant leptogenesis from modular symmetry neutrino models</strong>, Zhen-hua Zhao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09363v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.09363v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we have studied the consequences of some representative modular symmetry neutrino models for tri-resonant leptogenesis (which is realized by having three nearly degenerate right-handed neutrinos). To be specific, we have considered modular ${\rm A}^{}_4$, ${\rm S}^{}_4$ and ${\rm A}^{}_5$ symmetry models that have a right-handed neutrino mass matrix $M^{}_{\rm R}$ as shown in Eq.~(\ref{5}) which gives three degenerate right-handed neutrino masses and consequently prohibits the leptogenesis mechanism to work. For these models, we have considered two minimal ways to generate the desired small mass splittings among the three right-handed neutrinos: one scenario is to modify $M^{}_{\rm R}$ to a form as shown in Eq.~(\ref{7}), while another scenario is to consider the renormalization-group corrections for the right-handed neutrino masses. In the former scenario, for the considered models, the observed value of $\eta^{}_{\rm B}$ can always be successfully reproduced for appropriate values of $\mu$. But in the latter scenario not all the considered models can successfully reproduce the observed value of $\eta^{}_{\rm B}$.</p>

<p>2024-05-15, <strong>Revealing the Production Mechanism of High-Energy Neutrinos from NGC 1068</strong>, Abhishek Das et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09332v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.09332v1</a></p>

<p>The detection of high-energy neutrino signals from the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 provides us with an opportunity to study nonthermal processes near the center of supermassive black holes. Using the IceCube and latest Fermi-LAT data, we present general multimessenger constraints on the energetics of cosmic rays and the size of neutrino emission regions. In the photohadronic scenario, the required cosmic-ray luminosity should be larger than about 1-10% of the Eddington luminosity and the emission radius should be 15 Schwarzschild radii in low-beta plasma and 3 Schwarzschild radii in high-beta plasma. The leptonic scenario overshoots the NuSTAR or Fermi-LAT data for any emission radii we consider, and the required gamma-ray luminosity is much larger than the Eddington luminosity. The beta decay scenario also violates not only the energetics requirement but also gamma-ray constraints especially when the Bethe-Heitler and photomeson production processes are consistently considered. Our results rule out the leptonic and beta decay scenarios in a nearly model-independent manner, and support hadronic mechanisms in magnetically-powered coronae if NGC 1068 is a source of high-energy neutrinos.</p>

<p>2024-05-15, <strong>The Spectra of IceCube Neutrino Candidate Sources</strong>, Martina Karl et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09278v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.09278v1</a></p>

<p>We present recent work on the Spectra of IceCube Neutrino (SIN) candidate sources project. We defined a selection of candidate neutrino sources by identifying blazars in the vicinity of IceCube’s highest-energy neutrinos. We now want to shed light on these source candidates’ nature, starting at their redshift, continuing with their black hole masses, their variability, and, for the first time, a combined photon-neutrino spectral energy distribution. We present their hybrid spectral energy distributions (combining photon and neutrino fluxes), investigate the sources’ variability in the near-infrared, optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray bands, and compare the variability with a blazar sample of non-candidate sources. Furthermore, we search for flares at the arrival time of the high-energy neutrinos.</p>

<p>2024-05-15, <strong>Searches for Galactic Neutrinos with the IceCube Neutrino observatory</strong>, A. Sandrock et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09267v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.09267v1</a></p>

<p>The sources of galactic charged cosmic rays are so far unknown, because their arrival directions are randomized in the galactic magnetic field. Objects accelerating hadrons are expected to produce high-energy neutrinos. In addition, a diffuse galactic neutrino flux is predicted from interactions of galactic cosmic rays with matter during propagation through the galaxy. The IceCube neutrino observatory at the geographic South Pole instruments a cubic kilometer of ice with optical modules to detect the Cherenkov light of particles produced in neutrino interactions. Operating for more than a decade in its complete detector configuration, IceCube is in a unique position to search for neutrino sources. This contribution discusses the searches for a diffuse flux of neutrinos as wells as for neutrinos from candidate point sources and extended sources in the galactic plane.</p>

<p>2024-05-15, <strong>Quantum tomography with $τ$ leptons at the FCC-ee</strong>, M. Fabbrichesi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09201v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.09201v1</a></p>

<p>The Future Circular Collider (FCC) – in its first incarnation as a lepton collider – will produce, according to the proposed design, more than 100 billion pairs of $\tau$ leptons after working for four years at the energy of the $Z$-boson resonance. The $\tau$ lepton is special because its relatively long lifetime makes it possible to reconstruct the momenta of neutrinos emitted in the single pion decay mode. The resulting large number of events is an ideal source for a full quantum tomography of the process that will test quantum entanglement and the violation of Bell inequality with unprecedented precision. In addition, the study of polarizations and spin correlations can provide a competitive determination of the Weinberg angle $ \theta_W$ and constrain possible anomalous couplings in the neutral electroweak current. We utilize analytic results and Monte Carlo simulations to explore to what extent these goals might be accomplished.</p>

<p>2024-05-14, <strong>Probing Heavy Neutrino Magnetic Moments at the LHC using Long-Lived Particle Searches</strong>, Rebeca Beltrán et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08877v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.08877v1</a></p>

<p>We explore long-lived particle (LLP) searches using non-pointing photons at the LHC as a probe for sterile-to-sterile and active-to-sterile transition magnetic dipole moments of sterile neutrinos. We consider heavy sterile neutrinos with masses ranging from a few~GeV to several hundreds of GeV. We discuss transition magnetic dipole moments using the Standard Model effective field theory and low-energy effective field theory extended by sterile neutrinos ($N_R$SMEFT and $N_R$LEFT) and also provide a simplified UV complete model example. LLP searches at the LHC using non-pointing photons will probe sterile-to-sterile dipole moments two orders of magnitude below the current best constraints from LEP, while an unprecedented sensitivity to sterile neutrino mass of about 700 GeV is expected for active-to-sterile dipole moments. For the UV-model example with one-loop transition magnetic moments, the searches for charged lepton flavour violating processes in synergy with LLP searches at the LHC can probe new physics at several TeV mass scales and provide valuable insights into the lepton flavour structure of new physics couplings.</p>

<p>2024-05-14, <strong>A Dark Matter Fermionic Quantum Fluid from Standard Model Dynamics</strong>, Stephon Alexander et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08874v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.08874v1</a></p>

<p>We present a model of dark matter as a superconducting fluid of Cooper pairs of right handed neutrinos or of vector-like quarks. The superconducting dark matter is induced by attractive channels in the Standard Model Higgs and color sectors of the Standard Model, respectively. We show that, for each case, the solution to the gap equation provides viable dark matter candidates for suitable chemical potential values. The mechanism yields an ultra-light neutrino condensate with a mass of $m_{\rm DM} \sim 10^{-19} \text{eV}$ or a vector-like quark condensate with wide range of possible masses. Both cosmological and particle physics constraints on the model lead to a connection between the number of effective relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, and the chemical potential and CMB temperature at the time of fermion creation. We also find a relation between the superconducting fermion and baryon densities, with implications for the coincidence between the dark matter and baryon densities in standard cosmology. Given the natural $\text{eV}$ scale of neutrinos, this mechanism may have implications for the Hubble tension.</p>

<p>2024-05-14, <strong>Revisiting Reactor Anti-Neutrino 5 MeV Bump with $^{13}$C Neutral-Current Interaction</strong>, Pouya Bakhti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08724v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.08724v1</a></p>

<p>For the first time, we systematically investigate the potential of neutrino-nucleus neutral current interactions with $^{13}$C to identify the origin of the 5 MeV bump observed in reactor anti-neutrino spectra in the inverse beta decay process. The distinctive signal is obtained from the de-excitation of $^{13}$C$^*$ into the ground state emitting a 3.685 MeV photon in various liquid scintillator detectors. Such an interaction predominantly occurs for the reactor anti-neutrinos within the energy range coinciding with the 5 MeV bump. For a detector that has a capability of 95\% level photon and electron separation and small thorium contamination below $5 \times 10^{-17}$ gr/gr located in a site with an overburden of about a few hundred m.w.e, such as the location of near detectors of RENO and Daya Bay will have a great sensitivity to resolve the 5 MeV bump. In addition, we propose a novel approach to track the time evolution of reactor isotopes by analyzing our $^{13}$C signal shedding light on the contributions from $^{235}$U or $^{239}$Pu to the observed bump. This provides an extra powerful tool in both discriminating the flux models and testing any new physics possibilities for the 5 MeV bump at 3$\sigma$ to 5$\sigma$ level with much less systematic uncertainties and assuming 10 kt.year of data collection. Our detector requirements are realistic, aligning well with recent studies conducted for existing or forthcoming experiments.</p>

<p>2024-05-14, <strong>Tau polarization in neutrino-nucleus interactions at the LHC energy range</strong>, Reinaldo Francener et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08508v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.08508v1</a></p>

<p>Considering that the study of neutrino-nucleus interactions with incident neutrino energy ranges in the GeV-TeV range is feasible at the Large Hadron Collider, we investigate in this paper the degree of polarization ${\cal{P}}$ of the (anti) tau lepton produced in (anti) tau neutrino - tungsten interactions. We estimate the differential cross-sections and the longitudinal and transverse components of the tau lepton polarization as a function of the tau lepton energy and distinct values of the scattering angle, assuming different values for the energy of the incoming (anti) tau neutrino. Different models for the treatment of the nuclear effects in the parton distribution functions are assumed as input in the calculations. Our results indicate that $ {\cal{P}} &lt; 1$ for the neutrino energies reached at the LHC and are almost insensitive to the nuclear effects.</p>

<p>2024-05-14, <strong>A randomly generated Majorana neutrino mass matrix using Adaptive Monte Carlo method</strong>, Y Monitar Singh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08495v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.08495v1</a></p>

<p>A randomly generated complex symmetric matrix using Adaptive Monte Carlo method, is taken as a general form of Majorana neutrino mass matrix, which is diagonalized by the use of eigenvectors. We extract all the neutrino oscillation parameters i.e. two mass-squared differences ($\Delta m_{21}^2$ and $\Delta m_{32}^2$ ), three mixing angles ($\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$) and three phases i.e. one Dirac CP violating phase ($\delta_{CP}$) and two Majorana phases ($\alpha$ and $\beta$). The charge-parity (CP) violating phases are extracted from the mixing matrix constructed with the eigenvectors of the Hermitian matrix formed by the complex symmetric matrix. All the neutrino oscillation parameters within 3$\sigma$ bound are allowed in both normal hierarchy (NH) and inverted hierarchy (IH) consistent with the latest Planck cosmological upper bound, $\sum\vert m_i\vert&lt;0.12$ eV. This latest cosmological upper bound is allowed only in three cases of zero texture for $m_{11}=0$; $m_{11},m_{12}=0$ and $m_{11},m_{13}=0$ in normal hierarchy whereas none of zero texture is allowed in inverted hierarchy. We also study effective neutrino masses $m_{\beta}$ in tritium beta decay and $m_{\beta\beta}$ in neutrinoless double beta decay.</p>

<p>2024-05-14, <strong>$γ$ rays from in-flight positron annihilation as a probe of new physics</strong>, Pedro De la Torre Luque et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08482v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.08482v1</a></p>

<p>The $\gamma$ ray emission originating from in-flight annihilation (IA) of positrons is a powerful observable for constraining high-energy positron production from exotic sources. By comparing diffuse $\gamma$ ray observations of INTEGRAL, COMPTEL and EGRET to theoretical predictions, we set the most stringent constraints on electrophilic feebly interacting particles (FIPs), thereby proving IA as a valuable probe of new physics. In particular, we extensively discuss the case of MeV-scale sterile neutrinos, where IA sets the most stringent constraints, excluding $|U_{\mu4}|^{2} \gtrsim 10^{-13}$ and $|U_{\tau4}|^{2} \gtrsim 2\times 10^{-13}$ for sterile neutrinos mixed with $\mu$ and $\tau$ neutrinos respectively. These constraints improve existing limits by more than an order of magnitude. We briefly discuss the application of these results to a host of exotic positron sources such as dark photons, axion-like particles, primordial black holes (PBHs) and sub-GeV dark matter (DM).</p>

<p>2024-05-14, <strong>Three-dimensional Magneto-hydrodynamic Simulations of Core-collapse Supernovae: I. Hydrodynamic evolution and protoneutron star properties</strong>, Ko Nakamura et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08367v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.08367v1</a></p>

<p>We present results from three-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic, core-collapse simulations of sixteen progenitors following until 0.5 s after bounce. We use non-rotating solar-metallicity progenitor models with zero-age main-sequence mass between 9 and 24 $M_{\odot}$. The examined progenitors cover a wide range of the compactness parameter including a peak around $23 M_{\odot}$. We find that neutrino-driven explosions occur for all models within 0.3 s after bounce. We also find that the properties of the explosions and the central remnants are well correlated with the compactness. Early shock evolution is sensitive to the mass accretion rate onto the central core, reflecting the density profile of the progenitor stars. The most powerful explosions with diagnostic explosion energy $E_{\rm exp} \sim 0.75 \times 10^{51}$ erg are obtained by 23 and 24 $M_{\odot}$ models, which have the highest compactness among the examined models. These two models exhibit spiral SASI motions during 150-230 ms after bounce preceding a runaway shock expansion and leave a rapidly rotating neutron star with spin periods $\sim 50$ ms. Our models predict the gravitational masses of the neutron star ranging between $1.22 M_{\odot}$ and $1.67 M_{\odot}$ and their spin periods 0.04-4 s. The number distribution of these values roughly matches observation. On the other hand, our models predict small hydrodynamic kick velocity (15-260 km/s), although they are still growing at the end of our simulations. Further systematic studies, including rotation and binary effects, as well as long-term simulations up to several seconds, will enable us to explore the origin of various core-collapse supernova explosions.</p>

<p>2024-05-14, <strong>Quasinormal modes of charged black holes in Asymptotically Safe Gravity</strong>, Alexey Dubinsky et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08262v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.08262v1</a></p>

<p>We calculate quasinormal modes of scalar and neutrino perturbations around the charged black hole in Asymptotically Safe Gravity. We show that the charge and coupling constant change the quasinormal spectrum considerably. We show that previous calculations of scalar quasinormal modes in this background [F. Javed, Phys. Dark Univ., 44, 101450 (2024)] suffer from a large numerical error exceeding the effect, that is, the deviations of the frequencies from their Schwarzschild limits.

<p>Thanks to the successful performance of the James Webb Space Telescope, our understanding of the epoch of reionization of the Universe has been advanced. The ultraviolet luminosity functions (UV LFs) of galaxies span a wide range of redshift, not only revealing the connection between galaxies and dark matter (DM) halos but also providing the information during reionization. In this work, we develop a model connecting galaxy counts and apparent magnitude based on UV LFs, which incorporates redshift-dependent star formation efficiency (SFE) and corrections for dust attenuation. By synthesizing some observations across the redshift range $4\le z \le 10$ from various galaxy surveys, we discern the evolving SFE with increasing redshift and DM halo mass through model fitting. Subsequent analyses indicate that the Thomson scattering optical depth was $\tau_{\rm e} = 0.052^{+0.003}_{-0.002}$ and the epoch of reionization started (ended) at $z=20.58^{+6.25}_{-6.75}$ ($z=5.38^{+0.65}_{-0.70}$) which is insensitive to the choice of the truncated magnitude of the UV LFs. Incorporating additional dataset and some reasonable constraints, the amplitude of matter perturbation is found to be $\sigma_8=0.79\pm0.05$, which is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Future galaxy surveys and the dynamical simulations of galaxy evolution will break the degeneracy between SFE and cosmological parameters, improving the accuracy and the precision of the UV LF model further.</p>

<p>Macroscopic dark matter like nontopological solitons can form either via the fusion and accumulation of free particles or during cosmological phase transitions. Both mechanisms can create dark matter with large masses ranging from TeV to solar mass. This can lead to interesting targets in direct detection, astrophysical, and cosmological searches.</p>

<p>Light thermal dark matter has emerged as an attractive theoretical possibility and a promising target for discovery at experiments in the near future. Such scenarios generically invoke mediators with very small couplings to the Standard Model, but moderately strong couplings within the dark sector, calling into question theoretical estimates based on the lowest order of perturbation theory. As an example, we focus on a scenario in which (pseudo)-Dirac fermion dark matter is connected to the standard model via a dark photon charged under a new $U(1)^{\prime}$ extension of the standard model, and we investigate the impact of the next-to-leading order corrections to annihilation and scattering. We find that radiative corrections can significantly impact model predictions for the relic density and scattering cross-section, depending on the strength of the dark sector coupling and ratio of the dark matter to mediator mass. We also show why factorization into the yield parameter $Y$ typically presented in literature leads to imprecision. Our results are necessary to accurately map experimental searches into the model parameter space and assess their ability to reach thermal production targets.</p>

<p>2024-05-14, <strong>A Diffused Background from Axion-like Particles in the Microwave Sky</strong>, Harsh Mehta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08879v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.08879v1</a></p>

<p>The nature of dark matter is an unsolved cosmological problem and axions are one of the weakly interacting cold dark matter candidates. Axions or ALPs (Axion-like particles) are pseudo-scalar bosons predicted by beyond-standard model theories. The weak coupling of ALPs with photons leads to the conversion of CMB photons to ALPs in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. If they have the same mass as the effective mass of a photon in a plasma, the resonant conversion would cause a polarized spectral distortion leading to temperature fluctuations with the distortion spectrum. The probability of resonant conversion depends on the properties of the cluster such as the magnetic field, electron density, and its redshift. We show that this kind of conversion can happen in numerous unresolved galaxy clusters up to high redshifts, which will lead to a diffused polarised anisotropy signal in the microwave sky. The spectrum of the signal and its shape in the angular scale will be different from the lensed CMB polarization signal. This new polarised distortion spectrum will be correlated with the distribution of clusters in the universe and hence, with the large-scale structure. The spectrum can then be probed using its spectral and spatial variation with respect to the CMB and various foregrounds. An SNR of $\sim$ 4.36 and $\sim$ 93.87 are possible in the CMB-S4 145 GHz band and CMB-HD 150 GHz band respectively for a photon-ALPs coupling strength of $\mathrm{g_{a \gamma} = 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ using galaxy clusters beyond redshift z $= 1$. The same signal would lead to additional RMS fluctuations of $\sim \mathrm{7.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \mu K}$ at 145 GHz. In the absence of any signal, future CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory (SO), CMB-S4, and CMB-HD can put constraints on coupling strength better than current bounds from particle physics experiment CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST).</p>

<p>2024-05-14, <strong>A power spectrum approach to search for Axion-like Particles from resolved galaxy clusters using CMB as a backlight</strong>, Harsh Mehta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08878v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.08878v1</a></p>

<p>Axions or ALPs are hypothetical particles predicted by BSM theories, which make one of the dark matter candidates. These particles can convert into photons and vice-versa in the presence of magnetic field, with a probability decided by its coupling strength $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$. One of the ways to detect these particles is using the CMB as a backlight. As the CMB photons pass through a galaxy cluster, they can get converted into ALPs in the mass range $10^{-15}$ eV to $10^{-11}$ eV through resonant conversion in the presence of cluster magnetic fields. This leads to a polarized spectral distortion ($\alpha$-distortion) in the CMB as the photon polarization parallel to the magnetic field in the galaxy cluster is involved in the conversion. The fluctuations in the magnetic field and electron density in a galaxy cluster lead to spatially varying $\alpha$-distortion around the cluster, with a power spectrum that is different from the lensed CMB polarization power spectrum for the standard model of cosmology. By measuring the difference in the polarization power spectrum around a galaxy cluster from the all-sky signal, one can find new $\alpha$-distortion in the sky. For galaxy clusters resolvable in multiple EM bands, one can measure the coupling strength $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$ from the ALP power spectrum. Using multi-frequency techniques like ILC to clean the foregrounds, we show that the new power spectrum-based approach of the resolved galaxy clusters from upcoming CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 can detect (or put constraints) on the ALP-photon coupling strength of $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma} &lt; 5.24 \times 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ and $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma} &lt; 3.61 \times 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ at 95\% C.I. respectively for ALPs of masses $10^{-13}$ eV or for smaller $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$ for lighter ALP masses (Abridged).</p>

<p>2024-05-14, <strong>A calibrated model for N-body dynamical friction acting on supermassive black holes</strong>, Anna Genina et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08870v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.08870v1</a></p>

<p>Black holes are believed to be crucial in regulating star formation in massive galaxies, which makes it essential to faithfully represent the physics of these objects in cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. Limited spatial and mass resolution and the associated discreteness noise make following the dynamics of black holes especially challenging. In particular, dynamical friction, which is responsible for driving massive black holes towards the centres of galaxies, cannot be accurately modelled with softened $N$-body interactions. A number of subgrid models have been proposed to mimic dynamical friction or directly include its full effects in simulations. Each of these methods has its individual benefits and shortcomings, while all suffer from a common issue of being unable to represent black holes with masses below a few times the simulated dark matter particle mass. In this paper, we propose a correction for unresolved dynamical friction, which has been calibrated on simulations run with the code KETJU, in which gravitational interactions of black holes are not softened. We demonstrate that our correction is able to sink black holes with masses greater than the dark matter particle mass at the correct rate. We show that the impact of stochasticity is significant for low-mass black holes ($M_{\rm BH} \leq 5 M_{\rm DM}$) and propose a correction for stochastic heating. Combined, this approach is applicable to next generation cosmological hydrodynamics simulations that jointly track galaxy and black hole growth with realistic black hole orbits.</p>

<p>Minimal Dark Matter models feature one neutral particle that serves as a thermal relic dark matter candidate, as well as quasi-degenerate charged states with TeV masses. When the charged states are produced at colliders, they can decay into dark matter and a low-momentum (soft) charged particle, which is challenging to reconstruct at hadron colliders. We demonstrate that a 3 TeV Muon Collider is capable of detecting these soft tracks, enabling the discovery of thermal Higgsinos and similar dark matter candidates which constitute highly motivated scenarios for future collider searches.</p>

<p>Near-solar mass black holes (BHs) could have been involved in the two recent gravitational wave events, GW190425 and GW190814. Since such a low mass BH cannot be formed via stellar evolution, a model has been proposed based on the core collapse of a neutron star initiated by a certain number of dark matter (DM) particles. In this process, the accumulated DM particles collapse to form a tiny BH inside the neutron star, and the entire neutron star is transmuted into a BH after a certain time due to the accretion of matter by the endoparasitic BH from its host. Here, we argue that, depending on the initial conditions, a dark core collapse could give rise to either a BH or a naked singularity. For example, if the accumulated cloud of DM particles in the core of a neutron star can be modeled as an anisotropic fluid and it fulfils the criterion for collapse, an endoparasitic naked singularity could form instead of an endoparasitic BH. Immediately after its formation, the naked singularity should begin accreting matter from the host neutron star, thus eventually transmuting the entire host into a near-solar mass, relatively slowly-spinning naked singularity. We also propose a general technique to constrain the DM particle–neutron scattering cross section using the lack of pulsars near the Galactic centre and assuming that these missing pulsars have already been transmuted into BHs and/or naked singularities. Thus, the missing pulsars also indicate the existence of many such singularities near the Galactic center.</p>

<p>Observations of velocity dispersions of galactic structures over a wide range of scales point to the existence of a universal acceleration scale $a_0\sim 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$. Focusing on the fuzzy dark matter paradigm, which proposes ultralight dark matter with mass around $10^{-22}$ eV and de Broglie wavelength $\lambda\sim {\rm few}\times10^{2}$ parsecs, we highlight the emergence of the observed acceleration scale from quantum effects in a fluid-like description of the dark matter dynamics. We then suggest the possibility of a natural connection between the acceleration scale and dark energy within the same paradigm.</p>

<p>With the direct discovery of gravitational waves, black holes have regain interest in the recent years. In particular primordial black holes (PBHs), which originate from the very early Universe, may constitute (at least in part) dark matter. The possibility that dark matter is made of black holes is particularly appealing, and multi-messenger searches are important to probe this hypothesis. In this paper I will discuss the concept of primordial black holes, their origins, their characteristics and the current constraints. In addition I will explain that the study of black holes is of utmost interest since they may constitute portals to new physics and to quantum gravity.</p>

<p>2024-05-14, <strong>Primordial black holes generated by fast-roll mechanism in non-canonical natural inflation</strong>, Soma Heydari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08563v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.08563v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, a new fast-roll (FR) mechanism to generate primordial black holes (PBHs) and their coeval gravitational waves (GWs) in generalized non-canonical natural inflation is introduced. In this model, choosing a suitable function for non-canonical mass scale parameter $M(\phi)$ gives rise to produce a cliff-like region in field evolution path. When inflaton rolls down the steep cliff, its kinetic energy during the FR stage is amplified in comparison with slow-roll (SR) stage. Hence, seeds of PBHs production are born in this transient FR stage. Depending on the position of the cliff, appropriate cases of PBHs for explaining total dark matter (DM), microlensing effects, LIGO-VIRGO events and NANOGrav 15 year data can be formed. The density spectrum of GWs related to one case of the model lies in the NANOGrav 15 year domain and behaves like $\Omega_{\rm GW_0}\sim f^{5-\gamma}$. The spectral index $\gamma=3.42$ for this case satisfies the NANOGrav 15 year constraint. Moreover, regarding reheating considerations, it is demonstrated that PBHs are born in radiation-dominated (RD) era. Furthermore, viability of the model in light of theoretical swampland criteria and observational constraints on cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales are illustrated.</p>

<p>We study the mass distribution of galaxy clusters in Milgromian dynamics, or modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). We focus on five galaxy clusters from the X-COP sample, for which high-quality data are available on both the baryonic mass distribution (gas and stars) and internal dynamics (from the hydrostatic equilibrium of hot gas and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect). We confirm that galaxy clusters require additional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">missing matter' in MOND, although the required amount is drastically reduced with respect to the non-baryonic dark matter in the context of Newtonian dynamics. We studied the spatial distribution of the missing matter by fitting the acceleration profiles of the clusters with a Bayesian method, finding that a physical density profile with an inner core and an outer $r^{-4}$ decline (giving a finite total mass) provide good fits within $\sim$1 Mpc. At larger radii, the fit results are less satisfactory but the combination of the MOND external field effect and hydrostatic bias (quantified as 10$\%$-40$\%$) can play a key role. The missing mass must be more centrally concentrated than the intracluster medium (ICM). For relaxed clusters (A1795, A2029, A2142), the ratio of missing-to-visible mass is around $1-5$ at $R\simeq200-300$ kpc and decreases to $0.4-1.1$ at $R\simeq2-3$ Mpc, showing that the total amount of missing mass is smaller than or comparable to the ICM mass. For clusters with known merger signatures (A644 and A2319), this global ratio increases up to $\sim$5 but may indicate out-of-equilibrium dynamics rather than actual missing mass. We discuss various possibilities regarding the nature of the extra mass, in particular </code>missing baryons’ in the form of pressure-confined cold gas clouds with masses of $&lt;10^5$ M$_\odot$ and sizes of $&lt; 50$ pc.</p>

<p>Light mass warm dark matter is an interesting and viable alternative to the cold dark matter paradigm. An intriguing variation of this scenario is the mass-varying dark matter model where the dark matter mass varies with time during its cosmic history. This is realized in multiple particle physics models. In this work, we study the cosmological constraints on such a model where the dark matter mass transitions from zero to a finite value in the early Universe. In this model, the matter power spectrum exhibits power suppression below a scale that depends on the epoch of transition, and the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background show a distinctive phase shift. We use the latest cosmic microwave background and the weak lensing data to place lower limit on the transition redshift and ease the $S_8$ tension, unlike the warm dark matter model. This analysis also facilitates a marginal detection of the dark matter (DM) mass. Our findings reveal that while Planck data alone reduces the $S_8$ tension to approximately $2\sigma$, it does not sufficiently constrain the DM mass. However, when combined with the $S_8$ measurement from KIDS1000+BOSS+2dfLenS, the tension significantly decreases to roughly $1.3\sigma$, and we observe the detection of a DM mass at $41.7^{+7.81}_{-27.5}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Further analysis incorporating a combined data set from ACT and weak lensing results in an even more pronounced reduction in the tension to approximately $0.4\sigma$, alongside a higher detected mass of $51.2^{+16}_{-33.5}\,\mathrm{eV}$. We also find a better fit to the combined data compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</p>

<p>We develop a model-independent approach to lagrangian perturbation theory for the large scale structure of the universe. We focus on the displacement field for dark matter particles, and derive its most general structure without assuming a specific form for the equations of motion, but implementing a set of general requirements based on symmetry principles and consistency with the perturbative approach. We present explicit results up to sixth order, and provide an algorithmic procedure for arbitrarily higher orders. The resulting displacement field is expressed as an expansion in operators built up from the linear density field, with time-dependent coefficients that can be obtained, in a specific model, by solving ordinary differential equations. The derived structure is general enough to cover a wide spectrum of models beyond $\Lambda$CDM, including modified gravity scenarios of the Hordenski type and models with multiple dark matter species. This work is a first step towards a complete model-independent lagrangian forward model, to be employed in cosmological analyses with power spectrum and bispectrum, other summary statistics, and field-level inference.</p>

<p>Fuzzy dark matter wormhole solutions coupled with anisotropic matter distribution are explored in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet and $f(R)$ gravity, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar. We derive the shape function for fuzzy wormholes and explore their possible stability. We study the embedding diagrams of the active gravitational mass associated with fuzzy dark matter wormholes by taking a certain shape function. Aiming to highlight the role of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet and $f(R)$ gravity in the modeling of less complex fuzzy wormhole structures, we evaluate the complexity factor, the conservation equation, and null energy conditions. Our study reinforces more importance of uniformly distributed pressure effects throughout the less complex region than to the emergence of energy density homogeneity in the stability of fuzzy wormholes. It is shown that the active gravitational mass of the fuzzy wormhole structures varies inversely with the radial distance thereby suggesting the breaching of energy conditions at some arena of Einasto index. Furthermore, it is revealed that stable fuzzy dark matter wormhole structures exist in nature in the surroundings of cold dark matter halos and galactic bulges. The important physics understood from our analysis is that in both four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet and $f(R)$ gravity, feasible geometries of fuzzy dark matter wormholes exist naturally in the environments of different galactic haloes.</p>

<p>Recent studies suggested that the ejecta velocity of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) is a promising indicator in distinguishing the progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms. By classifying the SNe Ia based on their ejecta velocities, studies found SNe Ia with high Si II $\lambda$6355 velocities (HV SNe Ia; v&gt;12000 km/s) tend to be physically different from their normal-velocity counterparts (NV SNe Ia). In this work, we revisit the low-$z$ sample studied in previous work and closely look into the spatially resolved environment local to the site of SN explosion. Our results reveal a possible trend (at $2.4\sigma$ significance) that HV SNe Ia are likely associated with older stellar populations than NV SNe Ia. While the trend is inconclusive, the local host-galaxy sample studied in this work is likely skewed toward massive galaxies, limiting the parameter space that we would like to investigate from the original parent sample. Nevertheless, our results do not rule out the possibility that parameters other than the host-galaxy age (such as metallicity) could be the underlying factors driving the differences between HV and NV SNe Ia due to the limitation of our dataset.</p>

<p>Gravitational wave signals from core-collapse supernovae are one of the important observables for extracting the information of dense matter. To extract the properties of proto-neutron stars produced via core-collapse supernovae by asteroseismology, we perform a linear perturbation analysis using data obtained from two-dimensional numerical simulations. We employ 12 and 20 solar-mass progenitors and compare two different treatments of gravity. One is a general relativistic one with a conformal flatness condition and the other is an effective gravitational potential mimicking the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff solution. We discuss how the frequencies of the proto-neutron star oscillations corresponding to the gravitational wave signals in the simulations depend on the proto-neutron star properties. In our models, we find that the gravitational wave frequencies of the proto-neutron stars determined with the Cowling approximation can be expressed to very good approximation as a function of the proto-neutron star average density almost independently of the progenitor mass, treatment of gravity in the simulations, and the interpolations in the simulations. On the other hand, if one considers the gravitational wave frequencies as a function of the surface gravity of proto-neutron stars, such a relation appears sensitive to the treatment of gravity and other numerical details in the simulations. Thus, the average density of proto-neutron stars seems more suitable for universally expressing the supernova gravitational wave frequencies, instead of the surface gravity.</p>

<p>We present the largest extragalactic survey of supernova remnant (SNR) candidates in nearby star-forming galaxies using exquisite spectroscopic maps from MUSE. Supernova remnants exhibit distinctive emission-line ratios and kinematic signatures, which are apparent in optical spectroscopy. Using optical integral field spectra from the PHANGS-MUSE project, we identify SNRs in 19 nearby galaxies at ~ 100~pc scales. We use five different optical diagnostics: (1) line ratio maps of [SII]/H$\alpha$; (2) line ratio maps of [OI]/H$\alpha$; (3) velocity dispersion map of the gas; (4) and (5) two line ratio diagnostic diagrams from BPT diagrams to identify and distinguish SNRs from other nebulae. Given that our SNRs are seen in projection against HII regions and diffuse ionized gas, in our line ratio maps we use a novel technique to search for objects with [SII]/H$\alpha$ or [OI]/H$\alpha$ in excess of what is expected at fixed H$\alpha$ surface brightness within photoionized gas. In total, we identify 2,233 objects using at least one of our diagnostics, and define a subsample of 1,166 high-confidence SNRs that have been detected with at least two diagnostics. The line ratios of these SNRs agree well with the MAPPINGS shock models, and we validate our technique using the well-studied nearby galaxy M83, where all SNRs we found are also identified in literature catalogs and we recover 51% of the known SNRs. The remaining 1,067 objects in our sample are detected with only one diagnostic and we classify them as SNR candidates. We find that ~ 35% of all our objects overlap with the boundaries of HII regions from literature catalogs, highlighting the importance of using indicators beyond line intensity morphology to select SNRs. [OI]/H$\alpha$ line ratio is responsible for selecting the most objects (1,368; 61%), (abridged).</p>

<p>The recent discovery of the so-called TeV halos has attracted much attention. The morphology of the emission requires that the region is characterized by severe suppression of the diffusion coefficient. This finding raises many questions as to its origin: 1) is the suppressed diffusion {\bf to be} attributed to instabilities induced by the same radiating particles? 2) or does it actually show that the diffusion coefficient is small throughout the disc of the Galaxy? In both cases, one would expect that the surroundings of supernova remnants (SNRs) should also show evidence of reduced diffusion coefficient, since most remnants are located in the disc and are expected to be sites of effective particle acceleration. Should we expect the existence of regions of extended $\gamma$-ray emission from these regions as well? {\bf Here we investigate the transport of cosmic rays (CRs) escaped from SNRs in order to assess the viability of the idea of having a cocoon of suppressed diffusion around them. A comparison of our results with the $\gamma$-ray emission from the regions around HB9 and W28 does not provide solid evidence of reduced diffusivity. However, if indeed the phenomenon of reduced diffusivity occurs around SNRs surrounded by molecular clouds, our calculations show that the effects on the grammage of Galactic CRs can be significant.}</p>

<p>SN 2023ixf, recently reported in the nearby galaxy M101 at a distance of $6.85~{\rm Mpc}$, was one of the closest and brightest core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) in the last decade. In this work, we present multi-wavelength photometric observation of SN 2023ixf with the Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) in $uvgr$ bands and with the twin 50-cm telescopes in $griz$ bands. We find that the bolometric luminosity reached the maximum value of $3\times10^{43}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$ at 3.9 days after the explosion and fully settled onto the radioactive tail at $\sim90$ days. The effective temperature decreased from $3.2\times10^4~{\rm K}$ at the first observation and approached to a constant of $\sim(3000-4000)~{\rm K}$ after the first two months. The evolution of the photospheric radius is consistent with a homologous expansion with a velocity of $8700~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$ in the first two months, and it shrunk subsequently. Based on the radioactive tail, the initial nickel mass is about $M_{\rm Ni}\sim 0.098M_\odot$. The explosion energy and the ejecta mass are estimated to be $E\simeq(1.0-5.7)\times10^{51}~{\rm erg}$ and $M_{\rm ej}\simeq(3.8-16)M_\odot$, respectively. The peak bolometric luminosity is proposed to be contributed by the interaction between the ejecta and the circumstellar medium (CSM). We find a shocked CSM mass of $M_{\rm CSM}\sim0.013M_\odot$, a CSM density of $\rho_{\rm CSM}\sim2.5\times10^{-13}~{\rm g~cm^{-3}}$ and a mass loss rate of the progenitor of $\dot M\sim0.022M_\odot~{\rm yr^{-1}}$.</p>
