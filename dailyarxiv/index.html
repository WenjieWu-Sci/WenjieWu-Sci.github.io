<p>2024-06-06, <strong>Cogenesis by a sliding pNGB with symmetry non-restoration</strong>, Eung Jin Chun et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04180v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.04180v1</a></p>

<p>We show that a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) with an initial misalignment angle can drive successful spontaneous baryogenesis, and become a good dark matter candidate if the corresponding global symmetry is non-restored at high temperatures. Considering a dimension-five explicit breaking operator, we find that the pNGB starts its motion with a sliding across rapidly decreasing potential barriers during which the baryon asymmetry is generated and frozen, and later it oscillates as dark matter. It is predicted that the pNGB mass and decay constant are around $5\,{\rm eV}$ and $3\times10^6\,{\rm GeV}$, respectively, while the radial mode has a light mass $O(10)\,{\rm MeV}$ and a small mixing $O(10^{-4})$ with the Higgs boson. Applied to the Majoron in the type-I seesaw model, the heaviest right-handed neutrino is required to be as light as $100\,{\rm GeV}$. These predictions can be tested at kaon experiments, heavy neutral lepton searches, LHC, and future colliders.</p>

<p>2024-06-06, <strong>Estimate for the neutrino magnetic moment from pulsar kick velocities induced at the birth of strange quark matter neutron stars</strong>, Alejandro Ayala et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03745v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.03745v1</a></p>

<p>We estimate the magnetic moment of electron neutrinos by computing the neutrino chirality flip rate that can occur in the core of a strange quark matter neutron star at birth. We show that this process allows neutrinos to anisotropically escape thus inducing the star kick velocity. The process is not subject to the no-go theorem since, although the flip from left- to right-handed neutrinos happens at equilibrium, the reverse process does not take place, given that right-handed neutrinos do not interact with matter and therefore detailed balance is lost. For simplicity, we model the star core as consisting of strange quark matter. We find that even when the energy released in right-handed neutrinos is a small fraction of the total energy released in left-handed neutrinos, the process describes kick velocities for natal conditions which are consistent with the observed ones and span the correct range of radii, temperatures and chemical potentials for typical magnetic field intensities. The neutrino magnetic moment is estimated to be $\mu_\nu \sim 3.6 \times 10^{-18}\mu_B$, where $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton. This value is more stringent than the bound found for massive neutrinos in a minimal extension of the standard model.</p>

<p>2024-06-05, <strong>Does the Sun have a Dark Disk?</strong>, Gustavo F. S. Alves et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03607v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.03607v1</a></p>

<p>The Sun is not quite a perfect sphere, and its oblateness, thought to be induced through its rotation, has been measured using optical observations of its radius. Its gravitational quadrupole moment can then be deduced using solar models, or through helioseismology, and it can also be determined from measurements of its gravitational effects on Mercury’s orbit. The various assessments do not agree, with the most complete and precise orbital assessments being in slight excess of other determinations. This may speak to the existence of a non-luminous disk or ring, where we also note evidence for a circumsolar dust ring within Mercury’s orbit from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission. Historically, too, a protoplanetary disk may have been key to reconciling the Sun’s metallicity with its neutrino yield.   The distribution of the non-luminous mass within Mercury’s orbit can modify the relative size of the optical and orbital quadrupole moments in different ways. We develop how we can use these findings to limit a dark disk, ring, or halo in the immediate vicinity of the Sun, and we note how future orbital measurements of Mercury and near-Sun asteroids can refine these constraints.</p>

<p>2024-06-05, <strong>Analysis of experimental data on neutron decay for the possibility of the existence of a right vector boson $W_R$</strong>, A. P. Serebrov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03440v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.03440v1</a></p>

<p>Due to the assumption that sterile neutrinos are right-handed neutrinos, an analysis of the modern experimental situation in neutron decay for right-handed currents was carried out. As a result of the analysis, it was found that there are indications of the existence of a right-handed vector boson $W_R$ with a mass $M_{W_R}\approx 870_{-140}^{+260} \text{GeV}$ and a mixing angle with $W_L$: $\zeta=0.061_{-0.024}^{+0.017}$. This circumstance is the basis for discussing the possibility of expanding the Standard Model with an additional gauge vector boson $W_R$ and right-handed neutrinos.</p>

<p>2024-06-05, <strong>Minimal U(1) two-Higgs-doublet models for quark and lepton flavour</strong>, J. R. Rocha et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03331v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.03331v1</a></p>

<p>In the context of the 2HDM, and assuming that neutrinos acquire masses via the Weinberg operator, we perform a systematic analysis to determine the minimal quark and lepton flavour patterns, compatible with masses, mixing and CP violation data, realisable by Abelian symmetries. We determine four minimal models for quarks, where the number of independent parameters matches the number of observables. For the lepton sector, three minimal predictive models are identified. Namely, we find scenarios with a preference for the upper/lower octant of the $\theta_{23}$ atmospheric mixing angle, that exhibit lower bounds on the lightest neutrino masses currently probed by cosmology and testable at future neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, even for a normally-ordered neutrino masses. We investigate the phenomenology of each model taking into account all relevant theoretical, electroweak precision observables, scalar sector constraints, as well as stringent quark flavour processes such as $\overline{B} \rightarrow X_s \gamma$, $B_s \rightarrow \mu^- \mu^+$ and meson oscillations, and the charged lepton flavour-violating decays $e_\alpha^{-} \rightarrow e_\beta^{-} e_\gamma^{+} e_\delta^{-}$ and $e_\alpha \rightarrow e_\beta \gamma$. We show that, in some cases, Abelian flavour symmetries provide a natural framework to suppress flavour-changing neutral couplings and lead to scenarios featuring heavy neutral/charged scalar masses below the TeV scale within the reach of current experiments.</p>

<p>2024-06-05, <strong>Toward the measurement of neutrino masses: Performance of cosmic magnification with submillimeter galaxies</strong>, M. M. Cueli et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03236v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.03236v1</a></p>

<p>The phenomenon of magnification bias can induce a non-negligible angular correlation between two samples of galaxies with nonoverlapping redshift distributions. This signal is particularly clear when background submillimeter galaxies are used, and has been shown to constitute an independent cosmological probe. This work extends prior studies on the submillimeter galaxy magnification bias to the massive neutrino scenario, with the aim being to assess its sensitivity as a cosmological observable to the sum of neutrino masses. The measurements of the angular cross-correlation function between moderate redshift GAMA galaxies and high-redshift submillimeter H-ATLAS galaxies are fit to the weak lensing prediction down to the arcmin scale. The signal is interpreted under the halo model, which is modified to accommodate massive neutrinos. We discuss the impact of the choice of cosmological parametrization on the sensitivity to neutrino masses. The currently available data on the magnification bias affecting submillimeter galaxies are sensitive to neutrino masses when a cosmological parametrization in terms of the primordial amplitude of the power spectrum $(A_s$) is chosen over the local root mean square of smoothed linear density perturbations $(\sigma_8$). A clear upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses can be derived if the value of $A_s$ is either fixed or assigned a narrow Gaussian prior, a behavior that is robust against changes to the chosen value.</p>

<p>2024-06-05, <strong>The Amaterasu particle: constraining the superheavy dark matter origin of UHECRs</strong>, Prantik Sarmah et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03174v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.03174v1</a></p>

<p>Amaterasu, the second most energetic ($244$ EeV) cosmic ray particle has been recently detected by the Telescope Array (TA) surface detector. The origin of the TA Amaterasu event is puzzling, as its arrival direction points back to a void in the local Universe, lacking conventional astrophysical ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic ray (CR) sources. Hence, we explore the possibility if this TA Amaterasu event could have originated from the decay of superheavy dark matter (SHDM) in the Milky Way. Such an origin also opens up multi-messenger detection channels in both UHE gamma-rays and UHE neutrinos. In this present work, using the TA Amaterasu event and the multi-messenger limits/sensitivities from various UHE telescopes, we place stringent constraints on the lifetime and mass of the SHDM. We find that the non-detection of the corresponding gamma-rays at the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) and the TA is in severe tension with the SHDM parameter space required to explain the TA Amaterasu event. Additionally, we extend the multi-messenger analysis to the future UHE gamma-ray and UHE neutrino telescopes such as PAO upgrade, GRAND 200k and IceCube-Gen2. We find that the bounds from the future neutrino telescopes will be able to compete with the present UHECR bounds. However, compared to the existing UHE gamma-ray bounds, the future PAO upgrade and the GRAND 200k gamma-ray detectors will improve the bounds on SHDM lifetime by at least one order of magnitude.</p>

<p>2024-06-05, <strong>Effects of pairing strength on the nuclear structure and double-$β$ decay predictions within the mapped interacting boson model</strong>, Kosuke Nomura et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02986v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.02986v1</a></p>

<p>The low-energy nuclear structure and two-neutrino double-$\beta$ ($2\nu\beta\beta$) decay are studied within the interacting boson model (IBM) that is based on the nuclear energy density functional (EDF). The IBM Hamiltonian describing the initial and final even-even nuclei, and the interacting boson fermion-fermion Hamiltonian producing the intermediate states of the neighboring odd-odd nuclei, are determined by the microscopic inputs provided by the self-consistent mean-field (SCMF) calculations employing a relativistic EDF and a separable pairing force. Sensitivities of the low-lying structure and $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay properties to the pairing strength are specifically analyzed. It is shown that the SCMF calculations with the decreased and increased pairing strengths lead to the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction strengths in the IBM that are, respectively, significantly enhanced and reduced in magnitude. When the increased pairing is adopted, in particular, the energy levels of the excited $0^+$ states are lowered, and the predicted $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) increase in magnitude systematically. The mapped IBM employing the increased pairing force generates effective NMEs and half-lives that are overall in a reasonable agreement with the experimental data.</p>

<p>2024-06-05, <strong>Exploring active-sterile neutrino mixings models in MES mechanism using modular $S_3$ symmetry</strong>, Mayengbam Kishan Singh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02949v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.02949v1</a></p>

<p>We study the minimal extended seesaw mechanism with one sterile neutrino in a 3+1 framework using modular $S_3$ symmetry. The active-sterile neutrino models are classified based on the assignments of $S_3$ representations and modular weights of the left-handed lepton doublets, triplet right-handed neutrino, and sterile neutrino. No scalar flavons are considered, and the flavor symmetry is broken by the vacuum expectation value (vev) of the modulus $\tau$. For a particular set of representations of the Leptons and Higgs field, we obtain eleven (11) different models based on different modular weights of charged lepton $(k_L)$ and right-handed neutrino ($k_N$). Out of these, we consider two models, which are discriminated by carrying out the numerical analysis so that the parameter space in each model can fit the latest neutrino oscillation data at 3$\sigma$. The Planck cosmological bound on the upper limit of the sum of the active neutrino masses $\sum m_i &lt;0.12$eV is also considered. Finally, the best-fit parameters of the neutrino observables and model predictions are evaluated using the minimum $\chi^2$ analysis.</p>

<p>2024-06-05, <strong>Texture Zeros in modular Left-Right Symmetric Model</strong>, Ankita Kakoti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02944v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.02944v1</a></p>

<p>Texture zeros play a crucial role in the phenomenological implementation of a particular model in the Beyond Standard Model framework. As such, in this work we study the possibility concerning the origin of texture zero in the neutrino mass matrix in the context of modular Left-Right Symmetric Model. Implementation of texture zeros in the light neutrino mass matrix brings forth the existence of allowed and disallowed classes of the texture zero classification. In the present work, we have studied Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay, Lepton flavor violation and Resonant Leptogenesis and tried to analyze if the simultaneous study of these three phenomenology are connected with a common parameter space within the model. We have determined the possible combinations of 1-0 and 2-0 textures in the context of resulting light neutrino mass matrix and illustrated the allowed classes for both textures corresponding to the realization of neutrinoless double beta decay, leptogenesis and lepton flavor violation. The study has been carried out for both normal and inverted hierarchy and the results have been illustrated in the present work.</p>

<p>2024-06-05, <strong>An Expanded Set of Los Alamos OPLIB Tables in MESA: Type-1 Rosseland-mean Opacities and Solar Models</strong>, Ebraheem Farag et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02845v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.02845v1</a></p>

<p>We present a set of 1194 Type-1 Rosseland-mean opacity tables for four different metallicity mixtures. These new Los Alamos OPLIB atomic radiative opacity tables are an order of magnitude larger in number than any previous opacity table release, and span regimes where previous opacity tables have not existed. For example, the new set of opacity tables expands the metallicity range to $Z$\,=\,10$^{-6}$ to $Z$\,=\,0.2 which allows improved accuracy of opacities at low and high metallicity, increases the table density in the metallicity range $Z$\,=\,10$^{-4}$ to $Z$\,=\,0.1 to enhance the accuracy of opacities drawn from interpolations across neighboring metallicities, and adds entries for hydrogen mass fractions between $X$\,=\,0 and $X$\,=\,0.1 including $X$\,=\,$10^{-2}, 10^{-3}, 10^{-4}, 10^{-5}, 10^{-6}$ that can improve stellar models of hydrogen deficient stars. We implement these new OPLIB radiative opacity tables in \MESA, and find that calibrated solar models agree broadly with previously published helioseismic and solar neutrino results. We find differences between using the new 1194 OPLIB opacity tables and the 126 OPAL opacity tables range from $\approx$\,20–80\% across individual chemical mixtures, up to $\approx$\,8\% and $\approx$\,15\% at the bottom and top of the solar convection zone respectively, and $\approx$\,7\% in the solar core. We also find differences between standard solar models using different opacity table sources that are on par with altering the initial abundance mixture. We conclude that this new, open-access set of OPLIB opacity tables does not solve the solar modeling problem, and suggest the investigation of physical mechanisms other than the atomic radiative opacity.</p>

<p>2024-06-06, <strong>Dynamics-based halo model for large scale structure</strong>, Edgar M. Salazar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04054v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.04054v1</a></p>

<p>Accurate modelling of the one-to-two halo transition has long been difficult to achieve. We demonstrate that physically motivated halo definitions that respect the bimodal phase-space distribution of dark matter particles near halos resolves this difficulty. Specifically, the two phase-space components are overlapping and correspond to: 1) particles \it orbiting \rm the halo; and 2) particles \it infalling \rm into the halo for the first time. Motivated by this decomposition, Garc'ia [R. Garc'ia et. al., MNRAS 521, 2464 (2023)] advocated for defining haloes as the collection of particles orbiting their self-generated potential. This definition identifies the traditional one-halo term of the halo–mass correlation function with the distribution of orbiting particles around a halo, while the two-halo term governs the distribution of infalling particles. We use dark matter simulations to demonstrate that the distribution of orbiting particles is finite and can be characterised by a single physical scale $r_{\rm h}$, which we refer to as the \it halo radius. \rm The two-halo term is described using a simple yet accurate empirical model based on the Zel’dovich correlation function. We further demonstrate that the halo radius imprints itself on the distribution of infalling particles at small scales. Our final model for the halo–mass correlation function is accurate at the $\approx 2\%$ level for $r \in [0.1,50]\ h^{-1}\ Mpc$. The Fourier transform of our best fit model describes the halo–mass power spectrum with comparable accuracy for $k\in [0.06, 6.0]\ h\ Mpc^{-1}$.</p>

<p>2024-06-06, <strong>Galactic center GeV excess and classification of Fermi-LAT sources with machine learning</strong>, Dmitry V. Malyshev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03990v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.03990v1</a></p>

<p>Excess of gamma rays with a spherical morphology around the Galactic center (GC) observed in the Fermi large area telescope (LAT) data is one of the most intriguing features in the gamma-ray sky. The excess has been interpreted by annihilating dark matter as well as emission from a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We use a multi-class classification of Fermi-LAT sources with machine learning to study the distribution of MSP-like sources among unassociated Fermi-LAT sources near the GC. We find that the source count distribution of MSP-like sources is comparable with the MSP explanation of the GC excess.</p>

<p>2024-06-06, <strong>Observational constraints on phenomenological emergent dark energy and barotropic dark matter characterized by a constant equation of state parameter</strong>, Jianqi Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03936v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.03936v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a new cosmological model that considers dark matter as a barotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter and interprets dark energy as the phenomenological emergent dark energy rather than a cosmological constant. This proposal is based on extensive research on the extended properties of dark matter in the context of a cosmological constant and the intriguing findings that have emerged from our exploration of dark matter properties within the context of PEDE in our previous studies. We then place constraints on this model in light of the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, the Pantheon compilation of Type Ia supernovae, a prior on $H_0$ that based on the latest local measurement by Riess et al., and the combination of KiDS and the VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (KiDS+VIKING-450). The results indicate a preference for a positive dark matter equation of state parameter at 68\% confidence level for CMB+BAO, CMB+BAO+Pantheon and CMB+BAO+Pantheon+$H_0$ datasets. Furthermore, the Hubble tension between all of the datasets we used with R22 is very close to those of the PEDE, and the $S_8$ tension between Planck 2018 and KiDS+VIKING-450 is reduced from 2.3$\sigma$ in the PEDE model to 0.4$\sigma$ in the new model. However, Bayesian evidence indicates that PEDE favors our new model with very strong evidence from all the datasets considered in this study. Consequently, we conclude that the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model is not a viable alternative to the PEDE model.</p>

<p>2024-06-06, <strong>How much do we know the halo mass function? Predictions beyond resolution</strong>, Weiguang Cui et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03829v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.03829v1</a></p>

<p>As a common gravitation virialized object in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, dark matter halo connects from the large-scale structure all the way down to galaxy and star formation. However, as the nature of dark matter particles is still unclear, the smallest halo that can be formed in the universe is still unknown. Based on some simple assumptions, this paper uses the \textsc{hmf} package to investigate different halo functions used to quantify its number and mass distributions – the halo mass function and the integrated/differential mass function (IMF/DMF) respectively. The halo mass in this study extends from the galaxy cluster to the dark matter particle mass at the GeV scale. Surprisingly, different fitting functions for the HMF are in remarkable agreement, a scatter within 2 orders of magnitude, down to dark matter particle mass, of which the halo mass spans about 80 orders of magnitude and the HMF covers over 100 orders of magnitude. The DMF reveals an interesting and consistent peak at $\sim 10^{13} \hMsun$, which implies galaxy groups have the highest contribution to the total matter mass. Furthermore, the effects of cosmology parameters on these halo functions are also examined with the most massive halos, or these halo functions at the most massive halo mass end, more sensitive to them. Different behaviours of these halo functions due to the changes in cosmology parameters can be used to break the degeneracy between them.</p>

<p>Precision astrometry offers a way to probe new physics. By measuring the angular position of light sources at unprecedented precision, astrometry could probe minuscule fluctuations of underlying spacetime. This work explores the possibility of probing ultralight dark matter candidates using precision astrometry. Through the coherent and stochastic density fluctuations over the scale of its wavelength, ultralight dark matter perturbs the propagation of light and the geodesics of the observer and source, leading to unique time-dependent signatures in the angular position of background light sources. With detector specifications similar to the current and future astrometry observations, such as Gaia and Roman Space Telescope, it is shown that the ultralight scalar dark matter of mass $10^{-18}\,{\rm eV} \, \textrm{–} \, 10^{-16} \,{\rm eV}$ could be probed when its density near the solar system is about a few thousand times larger than the nominal dark matter density measured on a much larger kpc-scale. This sensitivity is comparable to current pulsar timing array observations at a similar mass range. Explicit expressions for the angular deflection induced by most generic metric perturbations are derived and its gauge invariance is explicitly checked at the linear order.</p>

<p>Ultralight dark matter induces time-dependent perturbations in the spacetime metric, enabling its gravitational direct detection. In this work, we propose using astrometry to detect dark matter. After reviewing the calculation of the metric in the presence of scalar dark matter, we study the influence of the perturbations on the apparent motion of astrophysical bodies. We apply our results to angular position measurements of quasars, whose vast distances from Earth present an opportunity to discover dark matter with a mass as low as $10^{-33} \, \mathrm{eV} $. We explore the prospects of very long baseline interferometry and optical astrometric survey measurements for detecting ultralight relics, finding that for the smallest masses, current astrometric surveys can detect dark matter moving locally with a velocity of $10^{-3}$ with energy density as low as $ 3 \times 10 ^{ - 11} ~{\rm GeV} / {\rm cm} ^3 $.</p>

<p>Nonlinear differential equations are derived that describe the time evolution of the test particle coordinates during finite motions in the gravitational field of oscillating dark matter. It is shown that in the weak field approximation, the radial oscillations of a test particle and oscillations in orbital motion are described by the Hill equation and the nonhomogeneous Hill equation, respectively. In the case of scalar dark matter with a logarithmic self-interactions, these equations are integrated numerically, and the solutions are compared with the corresponding solutions of the original nonlinear system to identify possible resonance effects.</p>

<p>The high densities of neutron stars (NSs) could provide astrophysical locations for dark matter (DM) to accumulate. Depending on the DM model, these DM admixed NSs (DANSs) could have significantly different properties than pure baryonic NSs, accessible through X-ray observations of rotation-powered pulsars. We adopt the two-fluid formalism in general relativity to numerically simulate stable configurations of DANSs, assuming a fermionic equation of state (EOS) for the DM with repulsive self-interaction. The distribution of DM in the DANS as a halo affects the path of X-rays emitted from hot spots on the visible baryonic surface causing notable changes in the pulse profile observed by telescopes such as NICER, compared to pure baryonic NSs. We explore how various DM models affect the DM mass distribution, leading to different types of dark halos. We quantify the deviation in observed X-ray flux from stars with each of these halos and explain how to interpret mass and radius measurements of NSs inferred from electromagnetic radiation if these dark halos exist.</p>

<p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) are an attractive dark matter candidate, particularly if they can explain the totality of it. At PBH masses below $\sim 10^{17}$g and above $\sim 10^{23}$g this possibility is excluded from the variety of arguments and with different confidence. The range in between, often referred to as the “asteroid mass window”, currently remains unconstrained. The most promising, in our view, way to probe this mass range is to use stars as the PBH detectors. If a star captures even a single PBH it starts being accreted onto it and eventually gets destroyed – converted into a sub-solar mass black hole. This process may have a variety of signatures form a mere star disappearance to supernova-type explosions of a new kind. The viability of this approach depends crucially on the probability of PBH capture by stars. In this chapter we summarize the existing capture mechanisms and discuss their implications for constraining the abundance of (or perhaps discovering) PBHs in the asteroid mass window.</p>

<p>2024-06-05, <strong>Exploring the Dark Frontier: White Dwarf-Based Constraints on Light Dark Matter</strong>, Jia-Shu Niu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03100v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.03100v1</a></p>

<p>In the vast expanse of our galaxy, white dwarfs (WDs) are natural sentinels, capturing the enigmatic dark matter (DM) particles that incessantly traverse their interiors. These celestial bodies provide a unique vantage point for probing interactions between DM particles and their constituents-nuclei or electrons-should such interactions exist. The captured DM particles may accumulate, undergo mutual annihilation, or be evaporated by the WD’s own nuclei or electrons, thereby perturbing the standard cooling sequence predicted by stellar evolution theory. This letter reports pioneering constraints on DM-electron interactions derived from an in-depth analysis of four pulsating WDs. By leveraging the period variation rates of their pulsation modes, we delineate the following constraints: for a form factor $F(q) = 1$, in the DM mass range $20 \mathrm{MeV}/c^{2} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim 80 \mathrm{MeV}/c^{2}$ with a cross-section limit of $\sigma_{\chi,e} \lesssim 10^{-56} \mathrm{cm}^{2}$; for a form factor $F(q) = (\alpha m_{e})^{2}/q^{2}$, in a the DM mass range $20\mathrm{MeV}/c^{2} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim 70 \mathrm{MeV}/c^{2}$ with a limit of $\sigma_{\chi,e} \lesssim 10^{-52} \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. These newly established constraints surpass current direct detection experiments by over fifteen orders of magnitude, forging a path into the uncharted territories of the DM parameter space. This work not only advances our understanding of light dark matter-electron interactions but also exemplifies the potential of WDs as important astrophysical laboratories for probing the elusive nature of DM.</p>

<p>Black holes threaded by massive vector fields can be subject to a superradiant instability, growing a cloud of massive vector particles around it. In this work, we consider what happens if such a dark matter candidate field mimicking a dark photon interacts with an accretion flow onto the black hole. By including a kinetic mixing term with the standard model photon, we extend the commonly used equations of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics to a dark photon constituent. The coupling to the dark photon then appears as an effective dynamo term together with a dark Lorentz force acting on the accreting matter. We numerically study the interactions between the superradiant dark photon cloud and the inner accretion flow by solving the coupled system in full numerical relativity. By parameterically varying the mixing parameter between dark and standard model sector, we provide a first investigation of how the accretion flow could be modified. Depending on the coupling strength, our solutions exhibit increased wind launching, as well as oscillation modes in the disk.</p>

<p>We construct the mechanism of formation of the scalar boson star (BS) having a hierarchy of self-similar “lumps” of dark matter (DM) built into the probability distribution function of allowed steps. It can ensure to study the dynamics of the BS formation through the “cross-over” between the free scalar DM and the compact condensate (CC) phase in one-dimensional model of the random fluctuation walk. The main inputs are the random fluctuating weight $\lambda &lt; 1$, the fundamental fluctuating length $\xi (\lambda)$ and the parameter $a &gt;1$ of the spatial separation between the DM “lumps” inside the BS. The solution to the functional equation for the characteristic probability to find the free scalar DM and the CC phase is obtained. The time evolution of the probability to form the DM “lump” (growth of the BS) is presented with the power-law cascades expression depending on $\lambda$ and $a$. The special cases for $\lambda$ in terms of the energy densities of the BS ($\rho_\star$) and the DM ($\rho_\odot$), as well as the Bose-Einstein correlation function for two scalar DM particles, are considered. The lower bounds on the critical temperature at the “cross-over” depending on $\rho_\odot$, $\rho_\star$, the average multiplicities of the scalar DM particles and the parameters related to the chaotically behaviour of the particles are obtained.</p>

<p>2024-06-06, <strong>Contribution of young massive star clusters to Galactic diffuse $γ$-ray emission</strong>, Stefano Menchiari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04087v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.04087v1</a></p>

<p>Context: Young massive stellar clusters (YMSCs) have emerged as potential $\gamma$-ray sources, after the recent association of a dozen YMSCs with extended $\gamma$-ray emission. The large size of the detected halos, comparable to that of the wind-blown bubble expected around YMSCs, makes the $\gamma$-ray detection of individual YMSCs rather challenging. As a result, the emission from most of the Galactic YMSCs could be unresolved, thus contributing to the diffuse $\gamma$-ray radiation observed along the Galactic Plane.   Aims: In this study, we estimate the possible contribution to the Galactic diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission from a synthetic population of YMSCs, and we compare it with observations obtained with different experiments, from 1 GeV to hundreds of TeV, in two regions of the Galactic Plane.   Methods: As the population of galactic YMSCs is only known locally, we evaluate the contribution of $\gamma$-ray emission relying on the simulation of synthetic populations of YMSCs based on the observed properties of local clusters. We compute the $\gamma$-ray emission from each cluster assuming that the radiation is purely hadronic in nature and produced by cosmic rays accelerated at the cluster’s collective wind termination shock.   Results: We find that the $\gamma$-ray emission from unresolved YMSCs can significantly contribute to the observed Galactic diffuse flux, especially in the inner part of the Galaxy. The result is independent of the assumed particle transport, but an important role is played by Wolf-Rayet stars. The predicted $\gamma$-ray flux should be considered as a lower limit, given that our calculation neglects the contribution of supernovae exploding in YMSCs.</p>

<p>2024-06-06, <strong>The Vela Pulsar Progenitor Was Most Likely a Binary Merger</strong>, Jeremiah W. Murphy et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04075v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2406.04075v1</a></p>

<p>Stellar evolution theory restricted to single stars predicts a minimum mass for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) of around eight solar masses; this minimum mass corresponds to a maximum age of around 45 million years for the progenitor and the coeval population of stars. Binary evolution complicates this prediction. For example, an older stellar population around 100 million years could contain stellar mergers that reach the minimum mass for core collapse. Despite this clear prediction by binary evolution, there are few, if any CCSNe associated with a distinctly older stellar population…until now. The stellar population within 150 pc of the Vela Pulsar is inconsistent with single-star evolution only; instead, the most likely solution is that the stellar population is $\ge$80 Myr old, and the brightest stars are mass gainers and/or mergers, the result of binary evolution. The evidence is as follows. Even though the main sequence is clearly dominated by a $\ge$80-Myr-old population, a large fraction of the corresponding red giants is missing. The best-fitting single-star model expects 51.5 red giants, yet there are only 22; the Poisson probability of this is $1.7 \times 10^{-6}$. In addition, there is an overabundance of bright, young-looking stars (25-30 Myrs old), yet there is not a corresponding young main sequence (MS). Upon closer inspection, the vast majority of the young-looking stars show either past or current signs of binary evolution. These new results are possible due to exquisite Gaia parallaxes and a new age-dating software called {\it Stellar Ages}.</p>

<p>We propose a new cosmological model that considers dark matter as a barotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter and interprets dark energy as the phenomenological emergent dark energy rather than a cosmological constant. This proposal is based on extensive research on the extended properties of dark matter in the context of a cosmological constant and the intriguing findings that have emerged from our exploration of dark matter properties within the context of PEDE in our previous studies. We then place constraints on this model in light of the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, the Pantheon compilation of Type Ia supernovae, a prior on $H_0$ that based on the latest local measurement by Riess et al., and the combination of KiDS and the VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (KiDS+VIKING-450). The results indicate a preference for a positive dark matter equation of state parameter at 68\% confidence level for CMB+BAO, CMB+BAO+Pantheon and CMB+BAO+Pantheon+$H_0$ datasets. Furthermore, the Hubble tension between all of the datasets we used with R22 is very close to those of the PEDE, and the $S_8$ tension between Planck 2018 and KiDS+VIKING-450 is reduced from 2.3$\sigma$ in the PEDE model to 0.4$\sigma$ in the new model. However, Bayesian evidence indicates that PEDE favors our new model with very strong evidence from all the datasets considered in this study. Consequently, we conclude that the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model is not a viable alternative to the PEDE model.</p>

<p>The pion-bump structure in the gamma-ray spectrum is a direct proof for the hadronic origin of the gamma rays, and thus the decisive evidence for the acceleration of hadronic cosmic rays in astrophysical objects. However, the identification of such a spectral feature is limited by the resolution and energy coverage of current gamma-ray instruments. Furthermore, there are unavoidable bremsstrahlung emissions from secondary and primary electrons, which may dominate the gamma-ray emission below the pion-bump. Thus, the study of this gamma-ray emission component can provide unique information on the acceleration and confinement of high-energy particles. In this paper, we studied the predicted gamma-ray spectrum assuming both hadronic or leptonic origin in mid-aged supernova remnants W44, we discuss the detection potential of future MeV missions on these emissions and possible implications.</p>

<p>We present JWST NIRCam (F356W and F444W filters) and MIRI (F770W) images and NIRSpec- IFU spectroscopy of the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). We obtained the data as part of a JWST survey of Cas A. The NIRCam and MIRI images map the spatial distributions of synchrotron radiation, Ar-rich ejecta, and CO on both large and small scales, revealing remarkably complex structures. The CO emission is stronger at the outer layers than the Ar ejecta, which indicates the reformation of CO molecules behind the reverse shock. NIRSpec-IFU spectra (3 - 5.5 microns) were obtained toward two representative knots in the NE and S fields. Both regions are dominated by the bright fundamental rovibrational band of CO in the two R and P branches, with strong [Ar VI] and relatively weaker, variable strength ejecta lines of [Si IX], [Ca IV], [Ca V] and [Mg IV]. The NIRSpec-IFU data resolve individual ejecta knots and filaments spatially and in velocity space. The fundamental CO band in the JWST spectra reveals unique shapes of CO, showing a few tens of sinusoidal patterns of rovibrational lines with pseudo-continuum underneath, which is attributed to the high-velocity widths of CO lines. The CO also shows high J lines at different vibrational transitions. Our results with LTE modeling of CO emission indicate a temperature of 1080 K and provide unique insight into the correlations between dust, molecules, and highly ionized ejecta in supernovae, and have strong ramifications for modeling dust formation that is led by CO cooling in the early Universe.</p>

<p>We present an investigation of clustered stellar feedback in the form of superbubbles identified within eleven galaxies from the FIRE-2 (Feedback in Realistic Environments) cosmological zoom-in simulation suite, at both cosmic noon (1 &lt; z &lt; 3) and in the local Universe. We study the spatially-resolved multiphase outflows that these supernovae drive, comparing our findings with recent theory and observations. These simulations consist of five LMC-mass galaxies and six Milky Way-mass progenitors (with a minimum baryonic particle mass of $m_{b.min} = 7100 M_{\odot}$), for which we calculate the local mass and energy loading factors on 750~pc scales from the identified outflows. We also characterize the multiphase morphology and properties of the identified superbubbles, including the `shell’ of cool ($T&lt;10^5$ K) gas and break out of energetic hot ($T&gt;10^5$ K) gas when the shell bursts. For all galaxies, the outflow mass, momentum, and energy fluxes appear to reach their peak during the identified superbubbles, and we investigate the effects on the interstellar medium (ISM), circumgalactic medium (CGM), and subsequent star formation rates. We find that these simulations, regardless of redshift, have mass-loading factors and momentum fluxes in the cool gas that largely agree with recent observations. Lastly, we also investigate how methodological choices in measuring outflows can affect loading factors for galactic winds.</p>

<p>White dwarfs are the remnants of stars not massive enough to become supernovae. This review explores the concept of strange dwarfs, a unique class of white dwarfs which contain cores of strange quark matter. Strange dwarfs have different sizes, masses, and evolutionary paths with respect to white dwarfs. They might form through the accumulation of normal matter on strange quark stars or by capture of strangelets. The stability of strange dwarfs has been debated, with initial studies suggesting stability, while later analyses indicated potential instability. This review revisits these discussions, focusing on the critical role of boundary conditions between nuclear and quark matter in determining stability. It also offers insights into their formation, structure, and possible detection in the universe.</p>

<p>We establish a cosmological-model-independent method to extract the apparent magnitude and its derivative at different redshifts from the Pantheon+ type Ia supernova sample, and find that the obtained values deviate clearly from the prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM model at the lowest redshift. This deviation can be explained as a result of a transition of the absolute magnitude $M$ in the low redshift region. The observations seem to favor this transition since the minimum values of $\chi^2$ for two ansatzes of a varying $M$ are less than that of a constant $M$. The Hubble constant tension is alleviated from larger than $5\sigma$ to be about $1$ to $2\sigma$ for a varying $M$, and the growth tension can be resolved after attributing the variation of $M$ to a modification of the effective Newton’s constant.</p>
