<p>2024-11-04, <strong>Askaryan Radio Array: searching for the highest energy neutrinos</strong>, Mohammad Ful Hossain Seikh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01761v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.01761v1</a></p>

<p>Searches for ultra-high energy ($E_\nu \geq 10$ PeV) cosmogenic and astrophysical neutrinos (UHENs) have been conducted by several experiments over the last two decades. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), located near the geographical South Pole, was one of the first two experiments that used radio antennas sensitive to orthogonal polarizations for detection of neutrino-induced Askaryan radiation. ARA comprises five independent autonomous stations, with an additional low threshold phased array merged with station 5, which were deployed at a depth of 100-200 m over the period 2012-2018, corresponding to a total livetime of more than 27 station years. In this article, we present a brief overview of the detector, its detection technique, and discuss a few of its major achievements with a focus on the current status of the array-wide UHEN search. We expect to produce the most sensitive results on the neutrino flux by any existing in-ice neutrino experiment below 1000 EeV energy.</p>

<p>The neutrino oscillation experiments provide definitive evidence of new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), and the neutrino mass-squared differences and flavor mixing have been precisely measured. This study examines the neutrino sector within the flavor-dependent $U(1)_F$ model, where the unique fermion sector can simultaneously address both the flavor mixing puzzle and the mass hierarchy puzzle. It is found that the lightest neutrino is naturally massless in this model, and the predicted neutrino mass-squared differences, flavor mixing angles, Dirac CP phase agree well with the experimental measurements. Additionally, the effects of the Dirac CP phase and Majorana CP phase on the theoretical predictions of the neutrino transition magnetic dipole moments are analyzed.</p>

<p>2024-11-04, <strong>Optimal Sensing of Momentum Kicks with a Feedback-Controlled Nanomechanical Resonator</strong>, Kaspar Schmerling et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02215v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.02215v1</a></p>

<p>External disturbances exciting a mechanical resonator can be exploited to gain information on the environment. Many of these interactions manifest as momentum kicks, such as the recoil of residual gas, radioactive decay, or even hypothetical interactions with dark matter. These disturbances are often rare enough that they can be resolved as singular events rather than cumulated as force noise. While high-Q resonators with low masses are particularly sensitive to such momentum kicks, they will strongly excite the resonator, leading to nonlinear effects that deteriorate the sensing performance. Hence, this paper utilizes optimal estimation methods to extract individual momentum kicks from measured stochastic trajectories of a mechanical resonator kept in the linear regime through feedback control. The developed scheme is illustrated and tested experimentally using a pre-stressed SiN trampoline resonator. Apart from enhancing a wide range of sensing scenarios mentioned above, our results indicate the feasibility of novel single-molecule mass spectrometry approaches.</p>

<p>2024-11-04, <strong>A minimalistic model for inelastic dark matter</strong>, Giovani Dalla Valle Garcia et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02147v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.02147v1</a></p>

<p>Models of inelastic (or pseudo-Dirac) dark matter commonly introduce a gauge symmetry spontaneously broken by the introduction of a dark sector version of the Higgs mechanism. We find that this ubiquitous introduction of two extra fields, a vector and complex scalar boson, is indeed unnecessary, with only a mass generating real scalar field being actually required. We consider a simple UV-complete model realizing this minimal setup and study the decays of the excited dark matter state as well as constraints from perturbative unitarity, (in)direct detection and colliders. We find that, in the visible freeze-out scenario ($ \text{DM} \, \text{DM} \leftrightarrow \text{SM} \, \text{SM} $), we still have unconstrained regions of parameter space for dark matter masses $\gtrsim 100$ GeV. Moreover, most of the available regions either present long-lived excited states, which are expected to interfere with the standard cosmological history, or will be probed by future direct detection experiments, such as DARWIN, due to the unavoidable residual elastic interactions. The only regions remaining out of experimental reach present highly fine-tuned parameters.</p>

<p>2024-11-04, <strong>Gravitational Collapse of Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter in Generalized Vaidya spacetime</strong>, Prabir Rudra et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02031v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.02031v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we study the gravitational collapse procedure in generalized Vaidya spacetime with Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter density profile. We use the generalized Vaidya metric to simulate the spacetime of a big star and subsequently obtain the field equations. Then we proceed to determine the star system’s mass parameter by solving the field equations. Then the gravitational collapse mechanism is investigated using the derived solutions. Investigating the nature of the singularity (if formed) as the end state of the collapse is the main goal. Dark matter in the form of Bose-Einstein condensate is expected to play a crucial role in the fate of the collapse. We see that there is a possibility of the formation of both black holes and naked singularities as the end state of the collapse depending upon the initial conditions. The junction conditions are derived with a Vaidya exterior and a Friedmann interior and some important insights are obtained. A Penrose diagram showing the causal relations between the spacetimes is generated and studied in detail.</p>

<p>2024-11-04, <strong>POSYDON Version 2: Population Synthesis with Detailed Binary-Evolution Simulations across a Cosmological Range of Metallicities</strong>, Jeff J. Andrews et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02376v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.02376v1</a></p>

<p>Whether considering rare astrophysical events on cosmological scales or unresolved stellar populations, accurate models must account for the integrated contribution from the entire history of star formation upon which that population is built. Here, we describe the second version of POSYDON, an open-source binary population synthesis code based on extensive grids of detailed binary evolution models computed using the MESA code, which follows both stars’ structures as a binary system evolves through its complete evolution from the zero-age main sequence, through multiple phases of mass transfer and supernovae, to their death as compact objects. To generate synthetic binary populations, POSYDON uses advanced methods to interpolate between our large, densely spaced grids of simulated binaries. In our updated version of POSYDON, we account for the evolution of stellar binaries across a cosmological range of metallicities, extending from $10^{-4}\,Z_{\odot}$ to $2\,Z_{\odot}$, including grids specifically focused on the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds ($0.2\,Z_{\odot}$ and $0.45\,Z_{\odot}$). In addition to describing our model grids and detailing our methodology, we outline several improvements to POSYDON. These include the incorporation of single stars in stellar populations, a treatment for stellar mergers, and a careful modeling of “reverse-mass transferring” binaries, in which an once-accreting star later becomes a donor star. Our simulations are focused on binaries with at least one high-mass component, such as those that host neutron stars and black holes, and we provide post-processing methods to account for the cosmological evolution of metallicity and star formation as well as rate calculations for gravitational wave events, gamma-ray bursts, and other transients.</p>
