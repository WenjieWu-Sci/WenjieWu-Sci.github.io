<p>2024-11-14, <strong>Effect of invisible neutrino decay on the neutrino oscillation at long-baselines</strong>, Animesh Chatterjee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09677v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.09677v1</a></p>

<p>In this article, we study the effect of invisible neutrino decay of the third neutrino state for accelerator neutrino experiments at two different baselines, 1300 km with a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) detector (similar to DUNE) and 2588 km with a water Cherenkov detector (similar to P2O). For such baselines, the matter effect starts to become important. Our aim is to ascertain the sensitivity to mass hierarchy and octant of $\theta_{23}$ in these two experiments in the presence of a decaying neutrino state. We compare and contrast the results of the two experimental setups. We find that, in general, hierarchy sensitivity decreases in the presence of decay. However, if we consider decay only in the opposite hierarchy (test scenario), in the 2588 km setup, the hierarchy sensitivity with the true hierarchy as IH is larger than the no decay case. We also study the dependence of hierarchy sensitivity with true $\theta_{23}$. We find that the dominant muon background in P2O plays an important role in how the hierarchy sensitivity depends on $\theta_{23}$. The octant sensitivity for both setups increases in the presence of decay except for the LArTPC setup in case true $\theta_{23}=49^\circ$. To understand the octant sensitivity results in the two setups, we check the synergy in sensitivity between electron and muon channels as a function of test $\theta_{23}$. We also study the degeneracies in the test $\theta_{23}-\delta_{CP}$ plane and find that combined analysis of the two setups removes all the degeneracies in the test $\theta_{23}-\delta_{CP}$ plane at $5\sigma$ significance.</p>

<p>2024-11-14, <strong>The lowest-radiation environments in the Solar System: new opportunities for underground rare-event searches</strong>, Xilin Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09634v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.09634v1</a></p>

<p>We study neutrino, muon, and gamma-ray fluxes in extraterrestrial environments in our Solar System via semi-analytical estimates and Monte Carlo simulations. In sites with negligible atmosphere, we find a strong reduction in the cosmic-ray-induced neutrino and muon fluxes relative to their intensities on Earth. Neutrinos with energies between 50 MeV and 100 TeV show particularly strong suppression, by as much as 10$^3$, even at shallow depths. The solar neutrino suppression increases as the square of the site’s distance from the Sun. Natural radiation due to nuclear decay is also expected to be lower in many of these locations and may be reduced to effectively negligible levels in the liquid water environments. The sites satisfying these characteristics represent an opportunity for greatly extending the physics reach of underground searches in fundamental physics, such as searches for WIMP Dark Matter, neutrinoless double-beta decay, the diffuse supernova neutrinos, and neutrinos from nearby supernova. As a potential near-term target, we propose a measurement of muon and gamma-ray fluxes in an accessible underground lunar site such as the Mare Tranquillitatis Pit to perform a first measurement of the prompt component in cosmic-ray-induced particle production, and to constrain lunar evolution models.</p>

<p>2024-11-14, <strong>Study of large extra dimension and neutrino decay at P2SO experiment</strong>, Papia Panda et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09628v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.09628v1</a></p>

<p>In this study, we examine two important new physics scenarios, \textit{i.e}, the theory of Large Extra Dimension (LED) and the theory of neutrino decay. We study LED in the context of P2SO, DUNE, and T2HK with emphasis on P2SO, whereas decay has been studied solely in the context of P2SO. For LED, in our study we find that the combination of P2SO, DUNE, and T2HK can provide a better bound than the current one only if all the oscillation parameters are measured with absolute certainty. However, for decay, one can obtain a better bound with P2SO as compared to ESSnuSB and MOMENT, but the bound obtained by P2SO is weak as compared to DUNE and T2HK. Regarding sensitivities to the current unknowns, if LED exists in nature, its impact on mass ordering, octant, and CP violation is very mild; however, decay can alter the sensitivities related to CP violation and octant in a non-trivial way.</p>

<p>2024-11-14, <strong>Likelihood and Deep Learning Analysis of the electron neutrino event sample at Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector (IWCD) of the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment</strong>, T. Mondal et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09562v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.09562v1</a></p>

<p>Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) is a next-generation long baseline neutrino experiment. One of its primary physics goals is to measure neutrino oscillation parameters precisely, including the Dirac CP violating phase. As conventional $\nu_{\mu}$ beam generates from the J-PARC neutrino baseline contains only 1.5$\%$ of $\nu_{e}$ interaction of total, it is challenging to measure $\nu_{e}/\bar{\nu}_{e}$ scattering cross-section on nuclei. To reduce these systematic uncertainties, IWCD will be built to study neutrino interaction rates with higher precision. Simulated data comprise $\nu_{e}CC0\pi$ as the main signal with NC$\pi^{0}$ and $\nu_{\mu}CC$ are major background events. To reduce the backgrounds initially, a log-likelihood-based reconstruction algorithm to select candidate events was used. However, this method sometimes struggles to distinguish $\pi^{0}$ events properly from electron-like events. Thus, a Machine Learning-based framework has been developed and implemented to enhance the purity and efficiency of $\nu_{e}$ events.</p>

<p>2024-11-14, <strong>The strong CP puzzle and axions</strong>, Christopher Smith et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09529v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.09529v1</a></p>

<p>In the first part of this talk, after a brief presentation of the strong CP puzzle, the construction of axion models and their main phenomenological features are described. In the second part, the possibility to mix the Peccei-Quinn symmetry with baryon and lepton numbers is discussed, showing that the axion could ultimately play a role in other puzzles of the Standard Model like the smallness of neutrino masses or baryogenesis.</p>

<p>2024-11-14, <strong>Simulation of the process $e^+e^- \rightarrow W^+W^-$ with the heavy right-handed neutrino exchange at 1 TeV future lepton colliders</strong>, A. Drutskoy et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09418v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.09418v1</a></p>

<p>We study potential contribution of the heavy right-handed neutrino exchange in the process $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow W^{+}W^{-}$. This process is sensitive to heavy neutrinos with masses larger than $\sqrt{s}$. The Monte Carlo simulation of the studied process is performed assuming the Seesaw type-I model, where heavy right-handed neutrinos (heavy neutral leptons, HNL) are introduced in the leptonic sector. Within the Standard Model (SM), the process has a large cross section described by diagrams with $s$-channel $Z / \gamma$ exchange and $t$-channel active neutrino exchange. Respectively, the $t$-channel right-handed neutrino exchange amplitude will interfere with these SM amplitudes. However, the angular distributions of the $W$ boson production and decay are different for the right-handed neutrino and SM amplitudes. That can be used to evaluate potential HNL contribution using the extended likelihood method. The simulation of the $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow W^{+}W^{-}$ process is performed at the 1 TeV center-of-mass energy and polarisation $P_{e^+e^-}$ of (20 %, -80 %), which is a standard option for the future linear $e^+e^-$ collider ILC. Both $W$ bosons are reconstructed from two hadronic jets. Simulation of the SM background processes is also done. The beam-induced backgrounds and the initial state radiation (ISR) effects are taken into account. The majority of background processes are effectively suppressed by the cuts on the invariant masses of two and four jets. Finally, we obtain upper limits on the mixing parameter $|V_{eN}|^2$ as a function of $M(N)$.</p>

<p>2024-11-14, <strong>New physics search via angular distribution of $ \bar{B} \to D^* (\to D π) τ(\to \ell ν_τ\barν_\ell) \barν_τ$ decays</strong>, Bhubanjyoti Bhattacharya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09414v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.09414v1</a></p>

<p>The study of $\bar{B} \to D^* \tau {\bar{\nu}}_\tau$ angular distribution can be used to get information about new physics, which has been motivated by the presence of various $B$ anomalies. However, the inability to measure precisely the three-momentum of tau hinders this process, as the tau decay contains one or more undetected neutrinos. In this work, we present a measurable angular distribution of $\bar{B} \to D^* \tau {\bar{\nu}}_\tau$ by considering the additional decay $\tau \to \ell \nu_\tau \bar{\nu}_\ell$, where $\ell \in { e , \mu }$. The full process used is $\bar{B} \to D^* (\to D \pi) \tau (\to \ell \nu_\tau \bar{\nu}_\ell) \bar{\nu}_\tau$, where only the $\ell$ and $D^<em>$ are reconstructed, and a fit to the experimental angular distribution of this process can be used to extract information on new physics parameters. To demonstrate, we generate simulated data for this process and perform a sensitivity study to obtain the expected statistical errors on new physics parameters from experiments in the near future. We obtained a sensitivity of the order of 5% for the right-handed current and around 6% for the tensor current. In addition, we use the recent lattice QCD data on $B \to D^</em>$ form factors and obtain correlations between form factors and new physics parameters.</p>

<p>2024-11-14, <strong>Towards Multi Energy Neutrino Astronomy: Diagnosing Enhanced Circumstellar Material around Stripped-Envelope Supernovae</strong>, Ryo Sawada et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09394v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.09394v1</a></p>

<p>A novel approach is proposed to reveal a secret birth of enhanced circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding a collapsing massive star using neutrinos as a unique probe. In this scheme, non-thermal TeV-scale neutrinos produced in ejecta-CSM interactions are tied with thermal MeV neutrinos emitted from a pre-explosion burning process, based on a scenario that CSM had been formed via the pre-supernova activity. Taking a representative model of the pre-supernova neutrinos, spectrum and light curve of the corresponding high-energy CSM neutrinos are calculated at multiple mass-loss efficiencies considered as a systematic uncertainty. In addition, as a part of method demonstration, the detected event rates along time at JUNO and IceCube, as representative detectors, are estimated for the pre-supernova and CSM neutrinos, respectively, and are compared with the expected background rate at each detector. The presented method is found to be reasonably applicable for the range up to 1 kpc and even farther with future experimental efforts. Potentialities of other neutrino detectors, such as SK-Gd, Hyper-Kamiokande and KM3NeT, are also discussed. This is a pioneering work of performing astrophysics with neutrinos from diverse energy regimes, initiating multi energy neutrino astronomy in the forthcoming era where next-generation large-scale neutrino telescopes are operating.</p>

<p>2024-11-14, <strong>On the possible contributions of two nearby blazars to the NGC 4151 neutrino hotspot</strong>, Anastasiia Omeliukh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09332v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.09332v1</a></p>

<p>The origin of the high-energy astrophysical neutrinos discovered by IceCube remains unclear, with both blazars and Seyfert galaxies emerging as potential sources. Recently, the IceCube Collaboration reported a ${\sim}{3}\sigma$ neutrino signal from the direction of a nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151. However, two gamma-ray loud BL Lac objects, 4FGL 1210.3+3928 and 4FGL J1211.6+3901, lie close to NGC 4151, at angular distances of 0.08$^\circ$ and 0.43$^\circ$, respectively. We investigate the potential contribution of these two blazars to the observed neutrino signal from the direction of NGC 4151 and assess their detectability with future neutrino observatories. We model the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions of both blazars using a self-consistent numerical radiation code, AM$^3$. We calculate their neutrino spectra and compare them to the measured NGC 4151 neutrino spectrum and future neutrino detector sensitivities. Our models predict neutrino emission peaking at $\sim$10$^{17}$ eV for both blazars, with fluxes of ${\sim}10^{-12}~\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$. This indicates their contribution to the $\sim$10 TeV neutrino signal observed from the direction of NGC 4151 is minor. While detection with current facilities is challenging, both sources should be detectable by future radio-based neutrino telescopes such as IceCube-Gen2’s radio array and GRAND, with 4FGL~J1210.3+3928 being the more promising candidate.</p>

<p>2024-11-14, <strong>Invisible decays of vector Charmonia and Bottomonia</strong>, G. Hernández-Tomé et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09124v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.09124v1</a></p>

<p>We compute the branching fractions of vector quarkonia ($V_Q=J/\psi, \psi’, \Upsilon(nS)$) decays into neutrino pairs, considering both Dirac and Majorana types, within the Standard Model (SM) and beyond. The vector nature of quarkonium states yields a decay width in the SM that depends upon the weak vector coupling of the heavy quark, offering the possibility to measure the weak mixing angle at the quarkonia mass scales. If neutrinos have non-standard neutral weak couplings, this could help to distinguish the nature of neutrinos in principle.</p>

<p>2024-11-14, <strong>Revisiting the LHC Constraints on Gauge-Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking Scenarios</strong>, Kirtiman Ghosh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09650v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.09650v1</a></p>

<p>Supersymmetry (SUSY) addresses several problems of the Standard Model, such as the naturalness problem and gauge coupling unification, and can provide cosmologically viable dark matter candidates. SUSY must be broken at high energy scales with mechanisms like gravity, anomaly, gauge mediation, etc. This paper revisits the Gauge Mediated SUSY Breaking (GMSB) scenarios in the context of data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiment. The ATLAS mono-photon search at 139 inverse femtobarn integrated luminosity at the 13 TeV LHC, in the context of a simplified General Gauge Mediation (GGM) scenario (which is a phenomenological version of GMSB with an agnostic approach to the nature of the hidden sector), relies on assumptions that do not hold across the entire parameter space. We identify a few crucial assumptions regarding the decay widths of SUSY particles into final states with gravitinos that affect the LHC limits on the masses of the SUSY particles. Our study aims to reinterpret the ATLAS constraints on the gluino-NLSP mass plane, considering all possible decay modes of SUSY particles in a realistic GGM model.</p>

<p>2024-11-14, <strong>The Redshift-Space Momentum Power Spectrum III: measuring the growth rate from the SDSSv survey using auto- and cross- power spectrum of the galaxy density and momentum fields</strong>, Fei Qin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09571v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.09571v1</a></p>

<p>The large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution over time contains an abundance of cosmological information. One way to unlock this is by measuring the density and momentum power spectrum from the positions and peculiar velocities of galaxies, and fitting the cosmological parameters from these power spectrum. In this paper, we will explore the cross power spectrum between the density and momentum fields of galaxies. We derive the estimator of the density-momentum cross power spectrum multipoles. The growth rate of the large-scale-structure, $f\sigma_8$ is measured from fitting the combined density monopole, momentum monopole and cross dipole power spectrum. The estimators and models of power spectrum as well as our fitting method have been tested using mock catalogues, and we find that they perform well in recovering the fiducial values of the cosmological parameters of the simulations, and we also find that the errors of the parameters can be largely reduced by including the cross-power spectrum in the fit. We measure the auto-density, auto-momentum and cross power spectrum using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14 peculiar velocity catalogue. The fit result of the growth rate $f\sigma_8$ is $f\sigma_8=0.413^{+0.050}_{-0.058}$ at effective redshift $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.073$, and our measurement is consistent with the prediction of the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter cosmological model assuming General Relativity.</p>

<p>2024-11-14, <strong>Collider fingerprints of freeze-in production of dark matter amidst the fast expansion phase of Universe</strong>, Anupam Ghosh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09464v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.09464v1</a></p>

<p>We examine a simple dark sector extension where the observed dark matter (DM) abundance arises from a freeze-in process through the decay of heavy vector-like quarks into a scalar dark matter candidate. The detection prospects of such DM are challenging due to the feeble nature of the interactions, but these vector-like quarks can be produced copiously at the LHC, where they decay to Standard Model quarks along with DM. Depending on the decay rate, this scenario is typically probed through long-lived particle or displaced vertex signatures, assuming a radiation-dominated background. An alternative hypothesis suggests that the Universe may have experienced a rapid expansion phase instead of the standard radiation-dominated one during freeze-in. This would significantly alter the dark matter phenomenology, requiring a substantial increase in the interaction rate to match the observed relic density, resulting in the rapid decay of the parent particle. As a result, much of the parameter space for this scenario is beyond the reach of traditional long-lived particle and displaced vertex searches. Due to this non-standard cosmic evolution, existing constraints do not cover the expanded dark matter parameter space. We propose a complementary search strategy to explore this scenario, offering additional limits alongside searches for long-lived particles and displaced vertices. In our search, we investigate the FIMP dark matter model at the LHC using boosted fatjets and significant missing transverse momentum. To improve precision, we include one-loop QCD corrections for LHC production processes and employ a boosted decision tree multivariate analysis, leveraging jet substructure variables to explore a vast parameter space for this minimally extended FIMP dark matter model at the 14 TeV LHC.</p>

<p>2024-11-14, <strong>A study on late time UV-emission in core collapse supernovae and the implications for the peculiar transient AT2018cow</strong>, Anne Inkenhaag et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09690v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.09690v1</a></p>

<p>Over time, core-collapse supernova (CCSN) spectra become redder due to dust formation and cooling of the SN ejecta. A UV detection of a CCSN at late times thus indicates an additional physical process such as interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar material, or viewing down to the central engine of the explosion. Both these models have been proposed to explain the peculiar transient AT2018cow, a luminous fast blue optical transient that has been detected in the UV 2-4 years after the event with only marginal fading over this time period. To identify if the late-time UV detection of AT2018cow could indicate that it is a CCSN, we investigate if CCSNe are detected in the UV between 2-5 years after the explosion. We use a sample of 51 nearby (z&lt;0.065) CCSNe observed with the Hubble Space Telescope within 2-5 years of discovery. We measure their brightness, or determine an upper limit on the emission through an artificial star experiment if there is no detection. For two CCSNe we detect a point source within the uncertainty region of the SN position. Both have a low chance alignment probability with bright objects within their host galaxies and are thus likely related to the SNe. Comparing the absolute UV magnitude of AT2018cow to the absolute UV magnitudes of the two potential SN detections, there is no evidence that a late-time UV detection of AT2018cow is atypical for interacting SNe. However, when limiting to CCSNe closer than AT2018cow, we see that it is brighter than the upper limits on most non-detections. Combined with a very small late time photospheric radius of AT2018cow, this leads us to conclude that AT2018cow’s late-time UV detection was not driven by interaction. It suggests instead that we are possibly viewing the inner region of the explosion. Such properties are naturally expected in tidal disruption models and are less straightforward in supernova scenarios.</p>

<p>Strongly lensed type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide a unique cosmological probe to address the Hubble tension problem in cosmology. In addition to the sensitivity of the time delays to the value of the Hubble constant, the transient and standard candle nature of SNe Ia also enable valuable joint constraints on the model of the lens and the cosmological parameters. The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to increase the number of observed SNe Ia by an order of magnitude in ten years of its lifetime. However, finding such systems in the LSST data is a challenge. In this work, we revisit the color-magnitude (CM) diagram used previously as a means to identify lensed SNe Ia and extend the work further as follows. We simulate LSST-like photometric data ($rizy$~bands) of lensed SNe Ia and analyze it in the CM parameter space. We find that a subset of lensed SNe Ia are redder compared to unlensed SNe Ia at a given magnitude, both in the rising and falling phases of their light curves and for SNe up to $z=3$. We propose a modified selection criterion based on these new results. We show that the contamination coming from the unlensed core-collapse (CC) SNe is negligible, whereas a small fraction of lensed CC SNe types Ib and Ic may get selected by this criterion as potential lensed SNe. Finally, we demonstrate that our criterion works well on a wide sample of observed unlensed SNe Ia, a handful of known multiply-imaged lensed SNe systems, and a representative sample of observed super-luminous supernovae.</p>

<p>Supernova remnants (SNRs) can exert strong influence on molecular clouds (MCs) through interaction by shock wave and cosmic rays. In this paper, we present our mapping observation of HCO+ and HCN 1-0 lines towards 13 SNRs interacting with MCs, together with archival data of CO isotopes. Strong HCO+ emission is found in the fields of view (FOVs) of SNRs W30, G9.7-0.0, Kes 69, 3C 391, 3C 396, W51C, HC 40, and CTB109 in the local-standard-of-rest (LSR) velocity intervals in which they are suggested to show evidence of SNR-MC interaction. We find an incomplete 12CO shell surrounding G9.7-0.0 with an expanding motion. This shell may be driven by the stellar wind of the SNR progenitor. We also find an arc of 12CO gas spatially coincident with the northwestern radio shell of Kes 69. As for the HCO+ line emission, SNRs 3C 391 and W51C exhibit significant line profile broadening indicative of shock perturbation, and CTB109 exhibits a possible blue-shifted line wing brought by shock interaction. We do not find significant variation of the I(HCO+)/I(HCN) line ratio between broad-line and narrow-line regions, among different SNRs, and between MCs associated with SNRs and typical Galactic MCs. Therefore, we caution on using the I(HCO+)/I(HCN) line ratio as a diagnostic of SNR feedback and CR ionization. We also estimate the N(HCO+)/N(CO) abundance ratio in 11 regions towards the observed SNRs, but they show little difference from the typical values in quiescent MCs, possibly because N(HCO+)/N(CO) is not an effective tracer of CR ionization.</p>
