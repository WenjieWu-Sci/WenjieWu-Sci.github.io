<p>2025-05-15, <strong>First Results on the Search for Lepton Number Violating Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay with the LEGEND-200 Experiment</strong>, H. Acharya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10440v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.10440v1</a></p>

<p>The LEGEND collaboration is searching for neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay by operating high-purity germanium detectors enriched in $^{76}$Ge in a low-background liquid argon environment. Building on key technological innovations from GERDA and the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR, LEGEND-200 has performed a first $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay search based on 61 kg yr of data. Over half of this exposure comes from our highest performing detectors, including newly developed inverted-coaxial detectors, and is characterized by an estimated background level of $0.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ cts/(keV kg yr) in the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay signal region. A combined analysis of data from GERDA, the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR, and LEGEND-200, characterized by a 90% confidence level exclusion sensitivity of $2.8 \times 10^{26}$ yr on the half-life of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, reveals no evidence for a signal and sets a new observed lower limit at $T^{0\nu}_{1/2} &gt; 1.9 \times 10^{26}$ yr (90% confidence level). Assuming the decay is mediated by Majorana neutrinos, this corresponds to an upper limit on the effective Majorana mass in the range $m_{\beta\beta} &lt; 70-200$ meV, depending on the adopted nuclear matrix element.</p>

<p>2025-05-15, <strong>Quest for a phenomenologically consistent low cutoff theory</strong>, Sudhakantha Girmohanta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10233v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.10233v1</a></p>

<p>The Randall-Sundrum model with the Higgs localized on the IR brane solves the gauge hierarchy problem. However, the associated low cutoff ($\Lambda \sim 10$ TeV) generically leads to unacceptably rapid nucleon decay and excessively large Majorana neutrino masses. Achieving consistency while simultaneously explaining the Yukawa hierarchy requires either a horizontal symmetry or a discrete gauged symmetry. We demonstrate that eliminating all dangerous operators within a horizontal symmetry framework must come with large and unattractive charge assignments, if possible at all. Hence, we consider an exact discrete gauged $\mathbf{Z}_N$ symmetry, with fermion mass hierarchies generated via wavefunction overlap. We employ this to reproduce the current CKM and PMNS structures. Under minimal assumptions, it predicts Dirac neutrinos with a total mass $\sim 66$ meV. Since the $\mathbf{Z}_N$ charges must be generation-blind, flavor observables serve as key probes.</p>

<p>2025-05-15, <strong>Constraints on dark matter self-interaction from velocity distribution function in isolated halos</strong>, Tirtha Sankar Ray et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10451v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.10451v1</a></p>

<p>Self-interactions facilitate inter-particle redistribution of energy within the dense regions of galactic halos, implying modifications in the density and velocity distribution of dark matter. Simulating dark-matter only isolated halos for a wide range of mass and specific self-scattering cross-sections, we make a systematic study of the impact of self-scattering on the velocity distribution profiles. We report a conservative bound on $\sigma/m$ $\leq 2.7 \rm cm^2/gm$ at $95\%$ C.L. from observations of rotation curves in Milky-Way size galaxies. Sub-leading bounds from LSB galaxy and clusters are also presented.</p>

<p>2025-05-15, <strong>Photomultiplier Requirements and Pre-Calibration for the SABRE South Liquid Scintillator Veto</strong>, L. J. Milligan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10353v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.10353v1</a></p>

<p>We present a study of the oil-proof base Hamamatsu R5912 photomultiplier tubes that will be used in the SABRE South linear-alkylbenzene liquid scintillator veto. SABRE South is a dark matter direct detection experiment at the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory, aiming to test the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter annual modulation signal. We discuss the requirements of the liquid scintillator system and its photomultipliers, outline the methods and analysis used for the characterisation measurements, and results from initial tests. We discuss the impact of these measurements on the performance of the active veto system and explore analysis methods to allow for low threshold operation. Finally, we include results from a small scale liquid scintillator detector prototype used to assess the future performance of pulse shape discrimination in the liquid scintillator veto, and how well accommodated it is by the R5912 PMTs.</p>

<p>2025-05-15, <strong>Resonant DM scattering in the galactic center under the influence of EMRI</strong>, Takafumi Kakehi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10036v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.10036v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter (DM) search is one of the greatest challenges in physics. If DM consists of particles, it may form a spike around supermassive black holes (BH) prevalent in galaxy centers. This spike could be potentially observed by altering the orbits of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs), one of LISAâs main targets. Meanwhile, the effects of EMRI on the DM spike have also been explored. In this study, we focus on the tidal resonances between DM particles and EMRI secondary. As the EMRI orbit evolves via gravitational wave backreaction, each DM particle experiences a significant number of resonances. Although the effect of each individual resonance is small, their cumulative impact might significantly alter the DM particleâs orbit. To examine this possibility, we explicitly derive the interaction Hamiltonian for tidal resonances and conducted numerical calculations.</p>

<p>2025-05-15, <strong>Constraining Fermionic Dark Matter with Galactic Neutron Stars</strong>, Jianyuan Luo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10026v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.10026v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter (DM) remains one of the most significant open questions in modern physics, with its nature and interactions largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the behavior of massive fermionic DM particles in the context of neutron stars (NSs), extending prior studies which focused on the bosonic DM. By incorporating the motion of NSs in the Galaxy and considering scenarios with and without DM self-annihilation, we demonstrate their impact on the DM capture rate and the accumulation process inside NSs. Observational data from pulsars in the Milky Way are used to place constraints on DM properties, including the mass and the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section, offering a more comprehensive picture in probing DM interactions in astrophysical environments.</p>

<p>2025-05-15, <strong>Multi-component Dark Matter from an $SU(2)<em>{D}\to Z</em>{3}^{D}\times Z_{2}^{\text{acc}}$ scenario</strong>, Carlos Alvarado et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10025v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.10025v1</a></p>

<p>A multi-component weakly-interacting dark matter scenario is analyzed, where the candidate dark matter states arise from the $SU(2)_{D}\to Z_{3}^{D}\times Z_{2}^{\text{acc}}$ symmetry breaking triggered by a VEV-developing scalar in the $J=3/2$ representation. While the discrete symmetries guarantee at least two stable states, a closer look at the mass orderings of the contrived dark sector reveals the existence of a third dark matter candidate, whose stability effectively results from the tight phase space in the dark boson sector. Regions of masses and couplings where the three dark states furnish a comparable contribution to the observed relic abundance are determined numerically.</p>

<p>2025-05-15, <strong>New cosmological constraints on the evolution of dark matter energy density</strong>, Yupeng Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09879v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.09879v1</a></p>

<p>We constrain the evolution of dark matter energy density over time, specifically focusing on deviation from the standard model represented by the equation $\rho_{m}\propto(1+z)^{3-\varepsilon}$, where $\varepsilon$ is a constant parameter. Utilizing a diverse array of observational datasets, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data from the first release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), distance priors derived from cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations by the Planck satellite, Hubble rate data obtained through the cosmic chronometers (CC) method, type Ia supernova (SNIa) data from the Panthon sample, and the data from the redshift space distortion (RSD) measurements ($f\sigma_8$), we derive stringent constraints on the deviation parameter. We find that for the model under consideration, the deviation parameter is constrained to be $\varepsilon = -0.0073^{+0.0029}_{-0.0033}$, indicating a deviation of approximately $2.4\sigma$ from the scenario where dark matter and vacuum dark energy do not interact. When compared with previous studies and alternative analyses, our findings provide corroborative evidence for an interaction between dark matter and vacuum dark energy, particularly in light of the release of BAO data from DESI.</p>

<p>2025-05-15, <strong>Genetic algorithm demystified for cosmological parameter estimation</strong>, Reginald Christian Bernardo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10450v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.10450v1</a></p>

<p>Genetic algorithm (GA) belongs to a class of nature-inspired evolutionary algorithms that leverage concepts from natural selection to perform optimization tasks. In cosmology, the standard method for estimating parameters is the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, renowned for its reliability in determining cosmological parameters. This paper presents a pedagogical examination of GA as a potential corroborative tool to MCMC for cosmological parameter estimation. Utilizing data sets from cosmic chronometers and supernovae with a curved $\Lambda$CDM model, we explore the impact of GAâs key hyperparameters â such as the fitness function, crossover rate, and mutation rate â on the population of cosmological parameters determined by the evolutionary process. We compare the results obtained with GA to those by MCMC, analyzing their effectiveness and viability for cosmological application.</p>

<p>2025-05-15, <strong>A hybrid SLAM-Payne framework for atmospheric parameter and abundance determination of early-type Stars from LAMOST DR9 low-resolution Spectra</strong>, Weijia Sun et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10310v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.10310v1</a></p>

<p>Early-type stars are key drivers of Galactic chemical evolution, enriching the interstellar medium with alpha elements through powerful stellar winds and core-collapse supernovae, fueled by their short lifetimes and high masses. However, their spectra remain challenging to analyse due to rapid rotation, weak metal lines, and non-LTE effects. While large spectroscopic surveys provide extensive low-resolution data, extracting reliable parameters remains difficult due to methodological limitations for hot stars. Our goal is to develop a unified framework combining data-driven and synthetic spectral approaches to determine atmospheric parameters and abundances for hot stars using low-resolution spectra, addressing limitations in current methodologies while retaining critical spectral information. We present a hybrid approach integrating the Stellar LAbel Machine (SLAM) and the Payne frameworks, for low-resolution ($R\sim 1800$) spectra from LAMOST DR9. Our method preserves full spectral information including Balmer series and metal-line blends, employing neural-network interpolation for efficient parameter estimation ($T_\mathrm{eff}$, $\log g$, and $v\sin i$) and abundance determination for O, Mg, Si, and Fe, across 8000 - 20000 K. We derive stellar parameters and abundances for 315,822 stars with $\mathrm{SNR} \geqslant 10$ in the $r$-band. Additionally, we detect abundance trends ([$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H]) that exhibit temperature-dependent systematics and a distinct $\alpha$-poor stellar population within $0.0 \leqslant \mathrm{[Fe/H]} \leqslant 0.5$ dex. The radial abundance gradients are negative and consistent with that derived from Cepheids, with a slope of $-0.070\pm0.007$ in \feh in the region $6 \leqslant R_\mathrm{GC}\leqslant 15$ kpc.</p>

<p>2025-05-15, <strong>Enhanced Mass Loss of Very Massive Stars: Impact on the Evolution, Binary Processes, and Remnant Mass Spectrum</strong>, Kendall G. Shepherd et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10206v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.10206v1</a></p>

<p>Very massive stars (VMS) play a fundamental role in astrophysics due to their winds and supernovae (SN), and their role as massive black hole (BH) progenitors. However, their origin and evolution remain a significant challenge. Recent theoretical work and observations suggest that VMS approaching the Eddington limit may experience mass loss above the standard wind predictions. This study investigates how enhanced winds influence single and binary VMS evolution, observable properties, and resulting BH populations. New stellar wind prescriptions, sensitive to the Eddington parameter ($\Gamma_e$) and the luminosity-to-mass ratio, were implemented into the stellar evolution code PARSEC v2.0. These updated single-star tracks (100 - 600 M$_{\odot}$ at Z=0.006) were used to model the VMS population in the Tarantula Nebula and integrated into the SEVN binary evolution code. The $\Gamma_e$-enhanced single-star tracks match observed VMS properties better than standard models. Explaining the most massive star, R136a1, through a single-star origin suggests a zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass limit of $&lt;$ 400 M$_{\odot}$ regardless of the wind recipe used. However, binary stellar mergers also offer a suitable origin for R136a1 and other observed VMS, potentially lowering the upper ZAMS mass limit by ~100 M$_{\odot}$. In binaries, enhanced winds inhibit main-sequence stellar mergers and limit BH production above the pair-instability mass gapâs lower edge (~50 M$_{\odot}$). Binary BHs merging in a Hubble time with enhanced winds yield more primary BHs above 30 M$_{\odot}$ and enable secondary BHs between 30-40 solar masses, a range not found with standard stellar winds at LMC metallicity. This study highlights the crucial role that stellar winds and binary interactions play in VMS evolution and offers predictions relevant for interpreting VMS observations and gravitational wave source origins.</p>

<p>2025-05-15, <strong>Probing the Dynamics of Gaussian Dark Energy Equation of State Using DESI BAO</strong>, Saddam Hussain et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09913v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2505.09913v1</a></p>

<p>We present an updated reconstruction of the various dark energy equation of state (EoS), $w(a)$, employing the newly released DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data. This analysis constrains the cosmological scenarios influenced by these equations through the joint examination of a range of recently available cosmological probes, specifically the Pantheon+ sample and the DESY5 sample of Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, Hubble parameter measurements derived from cosmic chronometers, and cosmic microwave background distance priors based on the Planck 2018 data. Furthermore, we provide a concise perspective on the dynamical evolution of all models and the interrelations among them. A Bayesian inference procedure is adopted to estimate the model parameters that yield the best fit to the data. The EoS remains within the phantom regime at higher redshifts, while favoring the quintessence regime in the current epoch. In this context, we propose a new Gaussian form EoS, termed BellDE, which avoids phantom behavior ((w \geq -1)) at higher redshifts while remaining precisely calibrated at lower redshifts. Interestingly, BellDE exhibits a transient phantom nature ((w &lt; -1)) only around the transition redshift (z \sim 0.5), subsequently evolving into a quintessential regime ((w &gt; -1)), as indicated by comparisons with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) and other parameterized EoS forms.</p>
