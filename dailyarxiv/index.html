<p>2024-05-06, <strong>One-dimensional power spectrum from first DESI Lyman-α forest</strong>, Corentin Ravoux et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03447v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03447v1</a></p>

<p>The Lyman-alpha forest is a unique probe of large-scale matter density fluctuations at high redshift z &gt; 2. We measure the one-dimensional Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum using the first data provided by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), with a fast Fourier transform estimator. The data sample contains quasar spectra included in the DESI Early Data Release and the first two months of the main survey. This first set of data already provides an improvement in terms of spectroscopic resolution with respect to the previous measurements. We investigated methodological and instrumental contaminants associated with DESI and used synthetic data to validate and correct our measurement. Coupling our measurement with theoretical predictions from hydrodynamical simulations will yield strong constraints on the primordial matter power spectrum, neutrino masses, and dark matter properties. A quadratic maximum likelihood estimator was applied to the same data set on a companion paper and agrees with our measurement.</p>

<p>2024-05-06, <strong>Updating neutrino mass constraints with Background measurements</strong>, Deng Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03368v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03368v1</a></p>

<p>Low-redshift probes, such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Supernovae Ia luminosity distances, have been shown to be crucial for improving the bounds on the total neutrino mass from cosmological observations, due to their ability to break degeneracies among the different parameters. Here, we expand background observations to include $H(z)$ measurements from cosmic chronometers, distance moduli from Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), and angular diameter distances from galaxy clusters. For the very first time, we find neutrino mass limits below the minimal expectations from neutrino oscillation probes, suggesting non-standard neutrino and/or cosmological scenarios. The tightening of the neutrino mass bound is due to the slightly higher value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ preferred by the former three background probes, and also due to the improved errors on $H_0$ and the matter mass-energy density $\Omega_{\rm m}$. All values of $H_0$ are however in agreement at the $1-2\sigma$ level. Interestingly, it is not only the combination of the three background probes that is responsible for the $\sum m_\nu &lt;0.06$~eV limits, but also each of them independently. The tightest bound we find here is $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.043$~eV at $2\sigma$ after combining Cosmic Microwave Background Planck data with DESI BAO, Supernovae Ia, GRBs, cosmic chronometers, and galaxy clusters, showing a clear tension between neutrino oscillation results and cosmological analyses. In general, removing either one of the two background probes still provides a limit $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06$~eV, reassuring the enormous potential of these low-redshift observations in constraining the neutrino mass.</p>

<p>2024-05-06, <strong>Study of quantum decoherence at Protvino to ORCA experiment</strong>, Chinmay Bera et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03286v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03286v1</a></p>

<p>Protvino to ORCA (Oscillation Research with Cosmics in the Abyss) (P2O) is an upcoming neutrino oscillation experiment with a very long baseline of 2595 km. Due to the substantial baseline, this experiment provides a unique opportunity to study the earth matter effects over very large distances. This makes it a suitable experiment to investigate the environmental decoherence in neutrino oscillations, where the neutrino system could interact with a stochastic environment and lead to a loss in the coherence of neutrino states. In this work, we consider an open quantum system framework to simulate the neutrino oscillations in P2O experiment and obtain bounds on the decoherence parameters in different phenomenological models. We assume that the decoherence parameter $\Gamma$ depends on neutrino energy $E_\nu$ as $\Gamma_{ij}(E_\nu) = \Gamma_{0} (\frac{E_\nu}{E_0})^n$. Further, we use these bounds to study the effect on the neutrino mass ordering sensitivity and CP violation sensitivity of P2O experiment.</p>

<p>2024-05-06, <strong>Choked precessing jets in tidal disruption events and high-energy neutrinos</strong>, Qi-Rui Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03139v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03139v1</a></p>

<p>It has been suggested that relativistic jets might have been commonly formed in tidal disruption events (TDEs), but those with relatively weak power could be choked by the surrounding envelope. The discovery of high-energy neutrinos possibly associated with some normal TDEs may support this picture in the hypothesis that the neutrinos are produced by choked jets. Recently, it was noted that disrupted stars generally have misaligned orbits with respect to the supermassive black hole spin axis and highly misaligned precessing jets are more likely to be choked. Here we revisit the jet break-out condition for misaligned precessing jets by considering the jet could be collimated by the cocoon pressure while propagating in the disk wind envelope. The jet head opening angle decreases as the jet propagates in the envelope, but the minimum power of a successful jet remains unchanged in terms of the physical jet power. We further calculate the neutrino flux from choked precessing jets, assuming that the cocoon energy does not exceed the kinetic energy of the disk wind. We find that neutrino flux from highly misaligned choked jets is sufficient to explain the neutrinos from AT2019aalc, while it is marginal to explain the neutrinos from AT2019dsg and AT2019fdr. The latter could be produced by weakly misaligned choked jets, since the duty cycle that the jet sweeps across increases as the misaligned angle decreases. We also show that the population of choked TDE jets could contribute to ~10% of the observed diffuse neutrino flux measured by IceCube.</p>

<p>2024-05-05, <strong>Authentic Majorana versus singlet Dirac neutrino contributions to $μ^-μ^-\to \ell^-\ell^-$ $(\ell=e,τ)$ transitions</strong>, Jorge Luis Gutiérrez Santiago et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02819v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.02819v1</a></p>

<p>We revisited the computation of the cross section for the $\mu^-\mu^-\to \ell^-\ell^{-}$ $(\ell^-=\tau^-,\, e^-)$ transitions in the presence of new heavy Majorana neutrinos. We focus on scenarios where the masses of the new states are around some few TeV, the so-called low-scale seesaw models. Our analysis is set in a simple model with only two new heavy Majorana neutrinos considering the current limits on the heavy-light mixings. Our results illustrate the difference between the genuine effects of two nondegenerate heavy Majorana states and the degenerate case where they form a Dirac singlet field.</p>

<p>2024-05-05, <strong>Consequences of the $μ$-$τ$ reflection symmetry for leptogenesis in a seesaw model with diagonal Dirac neutrino mass matrix</strong>, Zhen-hua Zhao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02804v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.02804v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we have studied the consequences of the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry for leptogenesis in the type-I seesaw model with diagonal Dirac neutrino mass matrix. We have first obtained the phenomenologically allowed values of the model parameters, which show that there may exist zero or equal entries in the Majorana mass matrix for the right-handed neutrinos, and then studied their predictions for three right-handed neutrino masses, which show that there may exist two nearly degenerate right-handed neutrinos. Then, we have studied the consequences of the model for leptogenesis. Due to the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry, leptogenesis can only work in the two-flavor regime. Furthermore, leptogenesis cannot work for the particular case of $r=1$. Accordingly, for some benchmark values of $r \neq 1$, we have given the constraints of leptogenesis for relevant parameters. Furthermore, we have investigated the possibilities of leptogenesis being induced by the renormalization group evolution effects for two particular scenarios. For the particular case of $r=1$, the renormalization group evolution effects will break the orthogonality relations among different columns of $M^{}_{\rm D}$ and consequently induce leptogenesis to work. For the low-scale resonant leptogenesis scenario which is realized for nearly degenerate right-handed neutrinos, the renormalization group evolution effects can break the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry and consequently induce leptogenesis to work.</p>

<p>2024-05-06, <strong>Opening a meV mass window for Axion-like particles with a microwave-laser-mixed stimulated resonant photon collider</strong>, Kensuke Homma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03577v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03577v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a microwave-laser-mixed three-beam stimulated resonant photon collider, which enables access to axion-like particles in the meV mass range. Collisions between a focused pulse laser beam and a focused microwave pulse beam directly produce axion-like particles (ALPs) and another focused pulse laser beam stimulates their decay. The expected sensitivity in the meV mass range has been evaluated. The result shows that the sensitivity can reach the ALP-photon coupling down to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-13})$~GeV${}^{-1}$ with $10^6$ shots if 10-100 TW class high-intensity lasers are properly combined with a conventional 100 MW class S-band klystron. This proposal paves the way for identifying the nature of ALPs as candidates for dark matter, independent of any cosmological and astrophysical models.</p>

<p>2024-05-06, <strong>Hierarchic Flows to Estimate and Sample High-dimensional Probabilities</strong>, Etienne Lempereur et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03468v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03468v1</a></p>

<p>Finding low-dimensional interpretable models of complex physical fields such as turbulence remains an open question, 80 years after the pioneer work of Kolmogorov. Estimating high-dimensional probability distributions from data samples suffers from an optimization and an approximation curse of dimensionality. It may be avoided by following a hierarchic probability flow from coarse to fine scales. This inverse renormalization group is defined by conditional probabilities across scales, renormalized in a wavelet basis. For a $\varphi^4$ scalar potential, sampling these hierarchic models avoids the critical slowing down at the phase transition. An outstanding issue is to also approximate non-Gaussian fields having long-range interactions in space and across scales. We introduce low-dimensional models with robust multiscale approximations of high order polynomial energies. They are calculated with a second wavelet transform, which defines interactions over two hierarchies of scales. We estimate and sample these wavelet scattering models to generate 2D vorticity fields of turbulence, and images of dark matter densities.</p>

<p>2024-05-06, <strong>Cosmology using Strong Gravitational Lensing</strong>, Angela L. H. Ng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03397v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03397v1</a></p>

<p>The light we observe from distant astrophysical objects including supernovae and quasars allows us to determine large distances in terms of a cosmological model. Despite the success of the standard cosmological model in fitting the data, there remains no underlying explanation for the accelerated expansion and dark matter. Furthermore, there is a current tension between early- and late-universe determinations of the Hubble constant. New techniques may offer the possibility of measuring out to larger distances, provide complementary information, or be able to side-step current limitations. After reviewing in detail the fundamentals of standard cosmology and gravitational lensing, including a derivation of the cosmological lens equation, this thesis investigates a novel method of cosmography based on combining the techniques of strong gravitational lensing time delay measurements and quasar reverberation mapping. The motivation for this method was the possibility of avoiding lens modelling challenges, such as the mass-sheet degeneracy, typically associated with time delay cosmography. It suggested that differential time delays originating from spatially separated signals in the Broad Line Region of a quasar could be distinguished and measured from the spectroscopy of the images, and utilised to provide a ratio of cosmological distances independent of the lensing potential. An analytic description of the effect of the differential lensing on the emission line spectral flux for axisymmetric Broad Line Region geometries is given, with the inclined ring or disk, spherical shell, and double cone as examples. This critical examination shows that the proposed method is unable to recover cosmological information, as the observed time delay and inferred line-of-sight velocity do not uniquely map to the three-dimensional position within the quasar.</p>

<p>2024-05-06, <strong>Dark matter models with suppressed dark matter nuclei elastic cross section</strong>, N. V. Krasnikov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03325v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03325v1</a></p>

<p>We propose two generalizations of the dark photon model which predict the suppressed elastic dark matter nuclei cross section in comparison with the corresponding prediction of the dark photon model. In the first model the main difference from dark photon model is that the mixing parameter $\epsilon$ is nonlocal formfactor $\epsilon(q^2)= \frac{q^2}{\Lambda^2}V(\frac{q^2}{\Lambda^2}) $ depending on the square of the momentum transfer $q^2$. Here $V(\frac{q^2}{\Lambda^2})$ is an entire function of the growth $\rho \geq \frac{1}{2}$ and $\Lambda$ is nonlocal scale. In this model our world and dark world are described by renormalizable field theories while the communication between them is performed by nonlocal interaction. The second model is renormalizable model where besides dark photon field $A’$ additional vector boson $Z’$ interacts with $B - L$ current. The communication between our world and dark world is performed due to nonzero kinetic mixing between $Z’$ and $A’$ fields. The predictions of the models for the search for dark matter at the accelerators don’t contain additional suppression factors.</p>

<p>2024-05-06, <strong>On bursty star formation during cosmological reionization - how does it influence the baryon mass content of dark matter halos?</strong>, Anand Menon et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03211v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03211v1</a></p>

<p>The baryon mass content of dark matter halos in the early Universe depends on global factors - e.g. ionising ultraviolet (UV) radiation background - and local factors - e.g. star formation efficiency and assembly history. We use a lightweight semi-analytical model to investigate how local and global factors impact halo baryon mass content at redshifts of $z\geq 5$. Our model incorporates a time delay between when stars form and when they produce feedback, which drive bursts of star formation, and a mass and redshift dependent UV background, which captures the influence of cosmological reionization on gas accretion onto halos. We use statistically representative halo assembly histories and assume that the cosmological gas accretion rate is proportional to the halo mass accretion rate. Delayed feedback leads to oscillations in gas mass with cosmic time, behaviour that cannot be captured with instantaneous feedback. Highly efficient star formation drives stronger oscillations, while strong feedback impacts when oscillations occur; in contrast, inefficient star formation and weak feedback produce similar long-term behaviour to that observed in instantaneous feedback models. If the delayed feedback timescale is too long, a halo retains its gas reservoir but the feedback suppresses star formation. Our model predicts that lower mass systems ($\leq 10^7 \text{M}_\odot$) at $z \leq 10$ should be strongly gas deficient, whereas higher mass systems retain their gas reservoirs because they are sufficiently massive to continue accreting gas through cosmological reionization. Interestingly, in higher mass halos, the median $m_\star/(m_\star+m_\text{g}) \simeq 0.01-0.05$, but is a factor of 3-5 smaller when feedback is delayed. Our model does not include seed supermassive black hole feedback, which is necessary to explain massive quenched galaxies in the early Universe.</p>

<p>2024-05-06, <strong>CURLING - I. The Influence of Point-like Image Approximation on the Outcomes of Cluster Strong Lens Modeling</strong>, Yushan Xie et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03135v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03135v1</a></p>

<p>Cluster-scale strong lensing is a powerful tool for exploring the properties of dark matter and constraining cosmological models. However, due to the complex parameter space, pixelized strong lens modeling in galaxy clusters is computationally expensive, leading to the point-source approximation of strongly lensed extended images, potentially introducing systematic biases. Herein, as the first paper of the ClUsteR strong Lens modelIng for the Next-Generation observations (CURLING) program, we use lensing ray-tracing simulations to quantify the biases and uncertainties arising from the point-like image approximation for JWST-like observations. Our results indicate that the approximation works well for reconstructing the total cluster mass distribution, but can bias the magnification measurements near critical curves and the constraints on the cosmological parameters, the total matter density of the Universe $\Omega_{\rm m}$, and dark energy equation of state parameter $w$. To mitigate the biases, we propose incorporating the extended surface brightness distribution of lensed sources into the modeling. This approach reduces the bias in magnification from 46.2 per cent to 0.09 per cent for $\mu \sim 1000$. Furthermore, the median values of cosmological parameters align more closely with the fiducial model. In addition to the improved accuracy, we also demonstrate that the constraining power can be substantially enhanced. In conclusion, it is necessary to model cluster-scale strong lenses with pixelized multiple images, especially for estimating the intrinsic luminosity of highly magnified sources and accurate cosmography in the era of high-precision observations.</p>

<p>2024-05-06, <strong>Investigation of Galactic supernova remnants and their environment in 26.6° &lt; l &lt; 30.6°, $\vert b \vert \leq$ 1.25° using radio surveys</strong>, Tian-Xian Luo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03324v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2405.03324v1</a></p>

<p>The problem of missing Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) refers to the issue that the currently known Galactic SNRs are significantly incomplete compared to the theoretical prediction. To expand the sample of Galactic SNRs, we use GLEAM and THOR+VGPS data across four wavebands ranging from 118 to 1420 MHz to drive a spectral index map covering the region within 26.6{\deg} &lt; l &lt; 30.6{\deg}, $\vert b \vert \leq$ 1.25{\deg}, where numerous SNR candidates were recently found. By using the spectral index map of the sky region and detailed analysis of the spectral indices of individual sources, we confirmed four SNR candidates, namely G26.75+0.73, G27.06+0.04, G28.36+0.21, and G28.78$-$0.44, as SNRs. Additionally, we discovered an expanding molecular superbubble located in this region, discussed pulsars associated with SNR candidates, and discovered a long H$\alpha$ filament that spatially overlaps with the candidate G29.38+0.10. We suggest that the problem of missing Galactic SNRs not only arises from observation limitations, but also could be due to the low-density environments of some SNRs, and the different SN explosion properties.</p>
