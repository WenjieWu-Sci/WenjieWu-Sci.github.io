<p>2024-11-11, <strong>wilson: A package for renormalization group running in the SMEFT with Sterile Neutrinos</strong>, Jason Aebischer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07220v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07220v1</a></p>

<p>Sterile neutrinos are well-motivated beyond the Standard Model (BSM) particles. The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) augmented with these new fields is known as the $\nu$SMEFT. We present the first code for solving the renormalization group equations (RGEs) of the $\nu$SMEFT in an automated way. For this purpose, we have implemented the $\nu$SMEFT as a new effective field theory (EFT) in the Wilson coefficient exchange format WCxf. Furthermore, we included anomalous dimensions depending on the gauge couplings and Yukawas in the python package wilson. This novel version of wilson allows a consistent inclusion of $\nu$SMEFT renormalization group (RG) running effects above the electroweak (EW) scale in phenomenological studies involving sterile neutrinos. Moreover, this new release allows us to study EW, strong, and Yukawa running effects separately within the SMEFT.</p>

<p>We reexamine a dynamical dark matter model with Kaluza-Klein (KK) towers of gravitons and neutrinos fitting together in the dark dimension. We show that even though gravitational decays of neutrino KK towers have little impact in cosmology the weak decay channel could have significant cosmological effects. Taking conservative upper bounds on the dark matter decay rate into two photons before recombination and on the number of effective extra neutrino species $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ we derive constraints on the conversion rate from active to sterile species despite the dependence of the mixing angle on the KK mode mass. We also provide counterarguments to a recent claim suggesting that the bounds on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ rule out micron-sized extra dimensions.</p>

<p>2024-11-11, <strong>Gravitational production of massive vectors non-minimally coupled to gravity</strong>, Bohdan Grzadkowski et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07222v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07222v1</a></p>

<p>A quantum theory of massive Abelian vector bosons with non-minimal couplings to gravity has been studied within an evolving, isotropic, and homogeneous gravitational background. The vectors may play a role of dark matter if stabilizing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is imposed. In order to construct a gauge invariant theory of massive vectors that couple to the Ricci scalar and Ricci tensor, a generalization of the Stuckelberg mechanism has been invoked. Constraints that ensure consistency of the model had been formulated and corresponding restrictions upon the space of non-minimal couplings have been found. Canonical quantization of the theory in evolving gravitational background was adopted. Mode equations for longitudinally and transversally-polarized vector bosons were derived and solved numerically. Regions of exponential growth in the solutions of the mode equations have been determined and discussed in detail. The spectral energy density for the three polarizations has been calculated, and the UV divergence of the integrated total energy density has been addressed. Finally, assuming their stability, the present abundance of the vector bosons has also been calculated.</p>

<p>2024-11-11, <strong>Receiver Noise in Axion Haloscopes</strong>, M. Guzzetti et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07172v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07172v1</a></p>

<p>Axions are a well-motivated candidate for dark matter. The preeminent method to search for axion dark matter is known as the axion haloscope, which makes use of the conversion of axions to photons in a large magnetic field. Due to the weak coupling of axions to photons however, the expected signal strength is exceptionally small. To increase signal strength, many haloscopes make use of resonant enhancement and high gain amplifiers, while also taking measures to keep receiver noise as low as possible such as the use of dilution refrigerators and ultra low-noise electronics. In this paper we derive the theoretical noise model based on the sources of noise found within a typical axion haloscope receiver chain, using the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) as a case study. We present examples of different noise calibration measurements at 1280~MHz using a variable temperature stage with ADMX during its most recent data taking run. The consistency between the measurements and the detailed model provide suggestions for future improvements within ADMX and other axion haloscopes to reach a lower noise temperature and to simplify the receiver chain design.</p>

<p>2024-11-11, <strong>Running Hubble constant: evolutionary Dark Energy</strong>, Giovanni Montani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07060v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07060v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss an evolutionary dark energy model, based on the presence of non-equilibrium effects on the dark energy constituents, which are described via a bulk viscosity contribution. We implement the proposed dynamics by the analysis of the 40-bins Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) Pantheon sample data, in order to outline the existence of a running Hubble constant with the redshift. Via a fitting procedure, we determine the value of the additional parameter that our model possesses with respect a standard $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario. As important result, the evolutionary dark energy proposal seems more appropriate to describe the binned SN analysis with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM Hubble parameter, i.e. a non running value for the Hubble constant over the bins.</p>

<p>2024-11-11, <strong>Conversion-Driven Dark Matter in $U(1)_{B-L}$</strong>, Jing-Jing Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06744v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.06744v1</a></p>

<p>The new gauge boson $Zâ$ in $U(1)_{B-L}$ is widely considered as the mediator of dark matter. In this paper, we propose the conversion-driven dark matter in $U(1)_{B-L}$. The dark sector contains two Dirac fermions $\tilde{\chi}_1$ and $\tilde{\chi}_2$ with $U(1)_{B-L}$ charge 0 and $-1$, respectively. A $Z_2$ symmetry is also introduced to ensure the stability of dark matter. The mass term $\delta m \bar{\tilde{\chi}}_1\tilde{\chi}_2$ induces the mixing of dark fermion. Then the lightest dark fermion $\chi_1$ becomes the dark matter candidate, whose coupling to $Zâ$ is suppressed by the mixing angle $\theta$. Instead of freezing-out via pair annihilation, we show that the observed relic abundance can be obtained through the conversion processes. We then explore the feasible parameter space of conversion-driven dark matter in $U(1)_{B-L}$. Under various experimental constraints, the conversion-driven dark matter prefers the region with $3\times10^{-6}\lesssim gâ\lesssim2\times10^{-4}$ and $0.02~\text{GeV}\lesssim m_{Zâ}\lesssim10$~GeV, which is within the reach of future Belle II, FASER and SHiP.</p>

<p>2024-11-11, <strong>Time-dependent metal ionization and the persistence of collisionally excited emission lines in the diffuse ionized gas of star forming galaxies</strong>, Lewis McCallum et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07108v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07108v1</a></p>

<p>We extend our time-dependent hydrogen ionization simulations of diffuse ionized gas to include metals important for collisional cooling and diagnostic emission lines. The combination of heating from supernovae and time-dependent collisional and photoionization from midplane OB stars produces emission line intensities (and emission line ratios) that follow the trends observed in the Milky Way and other edge-on galaxies. The long recombination times in low density gas result in persistent large volumes of ions with high ionization potentials, such as O III and Ne III. In particular, the vertically extended layers of Ne III in our time-dependent simulations result in [Ne III] 15$\mu$m/[Ne II] 12$\mu$m emission line ratios in agreement with observations of the edge-on galaxy NGC 891. Simulations adopting ionization equilibrium do not allow for the persistence of ions with high ionization states and therefore cannot reproduce the observed emission lines from low density gas at high altitudes.</p>

<p>2024-11-11, <strong>Running Hubble constant: evolutionary Dark Energy</strong>, Giovanni Montani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07060v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.07060v1</a></p>

<p>2024-11-11, <strong>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive stars at low metallicity VI. Atmosphere and mass-loss properties of O-type giants in the Small Magellanic Cloud</strong>, Frank Backs et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06884v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.06884v1</a></p>

<p>Mass loss through a stellar wind is an important physical process that steers the evolution of massive stars and controls the properties of their end-of-life products, such as the supernova type and the mass of compact remnants. For an accurate mass loss determination, the inhomogeneities in the wind, known as clumping, needs to be taking into account. We aim to improve empirical estimates of mass loss and wind clumping for hot main-sequence massive stars, study the dependence of both properties on the metallicity, and compare the theoretical predictions to our findings. We analyzed the optical and UV spectra of 13 O-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy, which has a metallicity of $\sim 0.2\,Z_\odot$. We quantified the stellar atmosphere, outflow, and wind-clumping properties. To probe the role of metallicity, we compared our findings to studies of Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud samples that were analyzed with similar methods. We find significant variations in the wind-clumping properties of the target stars, with clumping starting at flow velocities $0.01 - 0.23$ of the terminal wind velocity and reaching clumping factors $f_{\rm cl} = 2 - 30$. In the luminosity ($\log L / L_{\odot} = 5.0 - 6.0$) and metallicity ($Z/Z_{\odot} = 0.2 - 1$) range we considered, we find that the scaling of the mass loss $\dot{M}$ with metallicity $Z$ varies with luminosity. At $\log L/L_{\odot} = 5.75$, we find $\dot{M} \propto Z^m$ with $m = 1.02 \pm 0.30$, in agreement with pioneering work in the field. For lower luminosities, however, we obtain a significantly steeper scaling of $m &gt; 2$. The monotonically decreasing $m(L)$ behavior adds a complexity to the functional description of the mass-loss rate of hot massive stars. Although the trend is present in the predictions, it is much weaker than we found here.</p>

<p>2024-11-11, <strong>Post-common-envelope planetary nebulae</strong>, David Jones et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06831v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.06831v1</a></p>

<p>Close-binary central stars of planetary nebulae offer a unique tool with which to study the critical and yet poorly understood common-envelope phase of binary stellar evolution. Furthermore, as the nebula itself is thought to comprise the ionised remnant of the ejected common envelope, such planetary nebulae can be used to directly probe the mass, morphology and dynamics of the ejecta. In this review, I summarise our current understanding of the importance of binarity in the formation of planetary nebulae as well as what they may be able to tell us about the common-envelope phase - including the possible relationships with other post-common-envelope phenomena like stellar mergers, novae and type Ia supernovae.</p>

<p>2024-11-11, <strong>Proof of Shock-cloud interaction within parts of $Î³$-Cygni region</strong>, Yuan Li et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06730v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2411.06730v1</a></p>

<p>We reanalyze 15 yr data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope in a region around supernova remnant (SNR) $\gamma$-Cygni from 100 MeV to 1 TeV, and find that the spectra of two extended sources associated with the southeast radio SNR arc and the TeV VERITAS source can be described well by single power-laws with photon indices of $2.149\pm0.005$ and $2.01\pm0.06$, respectively. Combining with high resolution gas observation results, we model the emission in the hadronic scenario, where the $\gamma$-ray emission could be interpreted as escaped CRs illuminating a surrounding Molecular Cloud (MC) plus an ongoing shock-cloud interaction component. In this scenario, the difference between these two GeV spectral indices is due to the different ratios of the MC mass between the escaped component and the trapped component in the two regions. We further analyze, in a potential pulsar halo region, the relationship between energy density $\varepsilon_{\rm{e}}$, spin-down power $\dot{E}$, and the $\gamma$-ray luminosity $L_{\gamma}$ of PSR J2021+4026. Our results indicate that the existence of a pulsar halo is unlikely. On the other hand, considering the uncertainty on the SNR distance, the derived energy density $\varepsilon_{\rm{e}}$ might be overestimated, thus the scenario of a SNR and a pulsar halo overlapping in the direction of the line of sight (LOS) cannot be ruled out.</p>
