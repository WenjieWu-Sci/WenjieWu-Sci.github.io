<p>2025-03-31, <strong>Input from the SND@LHC collaboration to the 2026 Update to the European Strategy for Particle Physics</strong>, SND@LHC collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24233v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.24233v1</a></p>

<p>By observing collider neutrino interactions of different flavours, the SND@LHC and Faser experiments have shown that the LHC can make interesting contributions to neutrino physics. This document summarizes why the SND@LHC Collaboration intends to continue taking data at the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The upgraded detector will instrument the regions of both the neutrino vertex and the magnetized calorimeter with silicon microstrips. The use of this technology will allow us to continue the physics program of the current SND@LHC detector with higher statistics. It will also offer new possibilities. For instance, the magnetization of the hadron calorimeter will enable the separation between neutrinos and antineutrinos. This could lead to the first direct observation of tau antineutrinos. The use of ultrafast timing layers will enable triggers to be sent to ATLAS, potentially allowing the identification of the charm quark pair that produced the neutrino interacting in the detector. Such tagging of the neutrino source would fulfill Pontecorvo original proposal of a tagged neutrino beam. The experiment will perform unique measurements with high energy neutrinos and will also provide a means to measure gluon parton distribution functions in a previously unexplored domain (Bjorkenx &lt;10^-5). Furthermore, the technological advancements of the upgrade and the experience that will be gained in the areas of operation and data analysis will play a crucial role in the design of the neutrino detector for the SHiP experiment.</p>

<p>2025-03-31, <strong>Explodability criteria for the neutrino-driven supernova mechanism</strong>, K. Maltsev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23856v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.23856v1</a></p>

<p>Massive stars undergoing iron core collapse at the end of their evolution terminate their lives either in successful or failed supernovae (SNe). The physics of core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is complex, and their understanding requires computationally expensive simulations. The sampling of large, densely sampled parameter spaces of SN progenitors, as is needed e.g. for population synthesis studies, is thus not feasible. To remedy this situation, we present criteria that allow us to predict the final fates of stars by evaluating multiple explodability proxies derived from the stellar structure at the onset of core collapse. These are formulated based on the outcomes of a semi-analytic supernova model, evaluated over a set of ~3,900 heterogeneous stellar progenitors (single stars, binary-stripped and accretor stars). Over these, the explodabiliy criteria achieve an accuracy of &gt;99% agreement with the semi-analytic model. The criteria are tested on 29 state-of-the-art 3D CCSN simulation outcomes from two different groups. Furthermore, we find that all explodability proxies needed for our pre-SN criteria have two distinct peaks and intervening valleys as a function of the carbon-oxygen (CO) core mass $M_\mathrm{CO}$, which coincide with failed and successful SNe, respectively. The CO core masses of explodability peaks shift systematically with metallicity, $Z$, and with the timing of hydrogen-rich envelope removal in binary-stripped stars. With these, we identify critical values in $M_\mathrm{CO}$ that define windows over which black holes form by direct collapse. The outcome is a CCSN recipe based on $M_\mathrm{CO}$ and $Z$, applicable for rapid binary population synthesis and other studies. Our explodability formalism is consistent with SN observations that constrain the progenitor $M_\mathrm{CO}$ and partially addresses the missing red supergiant problem by direct black hole formation.</p>

<p>2025-03-31, <strong>European Contributions to Fermilab Accelerator Upgrades and Facilities for the DUNE Experiment</strong>, DUNE Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23744v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.23744v1</a></p>

<p>The Proton Improvement Plan (PIP-II) to the FNAL accelerator chain and the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) will provide the world’s most intense neutrino beam to the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) enabling a wide-ranging physics program. This document outlines the significant contributions made by European national laboratories and institutes towards realizing the first phase of the project with a 1.2 MW neutrino beam. Construction of this first phase is well underway. For DUNE Phase II, this will be closely followed by an upgrade of the beam power to &gt; 2 MW, for which the European groups again have a key role and which will require the continued support of the European community for machine aspects of neutrino physics. Beyond the neutrino beam aspects, LBNF is also responsible for providing unique infrastructure to install and operate the DUNE neutrino detectors at FNAL and at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF). The cryostats for the first two Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber detector modules at SURF, a contribution of CERN to LBNF, are central to the success of the ongoing execution of DUNE Phase I. Likewise, successful and timely procurement of cryostats for two additional detector modules at SURF will be critical to the success of DUNE Phase II and the overall physics program. The DUNE Collaboration is submitting four main contributions to the 2026 Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics process. This paper is being submitted to the ‘Accelerator technologies’ and ‘Projects and Large Experiments’ streams. Additional inputs related to the DUNE science program, DUNE detector technologies and R&amp;D, and DUNE software and computing, are also being submitted to other streams.</p>

<p>2025-03-31, <strong>DUNE Software and Computing Research and Development</strong>, DUNE Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23743v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.23743v1</a></p>

<p>The international collaboration designing and constructing the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) has developed a two-phase strategy toward the implementation of this leading-edge, large-scale science project. The ambitious physics program of Phase I and Phase II of DUNE is dependent upon deployment and utilization of significant computing resources, and successful research and development of software (both infrastructure and algorithmic) in order to achieve these scientific goals. This submission discusses the computing resources projections, infrastructure support, and software development needed for DUNE during the coming decades as an input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update for 2026. The DUNE collaboration is submitting four main contributions to the 2026 Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics process. This submission to the ‘Computing’ stream focuses on DUNE software and computing. Additional inputs related to the DUNE science program, DUNE detector technologies and R&amp;D, and European contributions to Fermilab accelerator upgrades and facilities for the DUNE experiment, are also being submitted to other streams.</p>

<p>2025-03-31, <strong>Angle-dependent in-situ fast flavor transformations in post-neutron star merger disks</strong>, Kelsey A. Lund et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23727v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.23727v1</a></p>

<p>The remnant black hole-accretion disk system resulting from binary neutron star mergers has proven to be a promising site for synthesizing the heaviest elements via rapid neutron capture (r-process). A critical factor in determining the full r-process pattern in these environments is the neutron richness of the ejecta, which is strongly influenced by neutrino interactions. One key ingredient shaping these interactions is fast neutrino flavor conversions (FFCs), which arise due to angular crossings in neutrino distributions and occur on nanosecond timescales. We present the first three-dimensional, in-situ, angle-dependent modeling of FFCs in post-merger disks, implemented within general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with Monte Carlo neutrino transport. Our results reveal that, by suppressing electron neutrinos, FFCs more efficiently cool the disk and weaken the early thermally driven wind. Less re-leptonization due to electron neutrino absorption makes this cooler wind more neutron-rich, producing a more robust r-process at higher latitudes of the outflow. This study underscores the necessity of incorporating FFCs in realistic simulations.</p>

<p>2025-03-31, <strong>Modelling Gaia photometry signals of dark halos</strong>, George Pappas et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23868v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.23868v1</a></p>

<p>We use the framework of microlensing to show that observations of binary systems, such as those made by {\it Gaia}, combined with follow-up weak lensing measurements, can provide a means to probe halos of exotic matter, possibly clumped around compact objects such as black holes. This could potentially cover a broad range of physical scenarios - from dark matter mini-halos to black holes with bosonic configurations around them, known as hair. Assuming that light can freely propagate through the halo of the exotic matter, the companion star will produce characteristic, sizable lensing signatures due to the deviation from a central gravitational potential. The signature of the multiple images, the magnification and the light-curve could be the smoking gun of such structures. We discuss how the precise observations of the {\it Gaia} survey offer an opportunity to search for new, yet undiscovered fundamental fields interacting gravitationally with baryons.</p>

<p>2025-03-31, <strong>Formation of the Little Red Dots from the Core-collapse of Self-interacting Dark Matter Halos</strong>, Fangzhou Jiang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23710v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.23710v2</a></p>

<p>We present a statistical study on the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) seeded by gravothermal core-collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos at high redshifts, using a semi-analytical framework based on Monte-Carlo merger trees. We demonstrate that BH formation via gravothermal collapse naturally occurs in high-concentration halos at a characteristic mass scale determined by the SIDM cross section, and only during the early Universe. This mechanism is particularly promising for explaining the abundance of little red dots (LRDs) – a population of early, apparently galaxy-less active galactic nuclei hosting supermassive BHs. By incorporating this seeding process with simplified models of BH growth and mergers, we successfully reproduce the observed LRD mass function for moderately large cross sections of $\sigma_{0m} \sim 30 \mathrm{cm^2\,g^{-1}}$ and $\omega \sim 80\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, intriguingly consistent with independent local constraints derived from galaxy rotation curves. Our results highlight the potential of high-redshift BH statistics as a complementary probe for constraining SIDM models.</p>

<p>2025-03-31, <strong>Modified cosmology though spacetime thermodynamics and generalized mass-to-horizon entropy</strong>, Spyros Basilakos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24355v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.24355v1</a></p>

<p>In this work we apply the gravity-thermodynamics approach for the case of generalized mass-to-horizon entropy, which is a two-parameter extension of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy that arises from the extended mass-to-horizon relation, that is in turn required in order to have consistency with the Clausius relation. We extract the modified Friedmann equations and we obtain an effective dark energy sector arising from the novel terms. We derive analytical solutions for the dark energy density parameter, the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, and the deceleration parameter, and we show that the Universe exhibits the usual thermal history with the succession of matter and dark energy epochs. Additionally, depending on the value of the entropy parameters, the dark energy equation-of-state parameter can either lie in the phantom regime at high redshifts entering into the quintessence regime at small redshifts, or it can lie in the quintessence regime at high redshifts and experience the phantom-divide crossing at small redshifts, while in the far future in all cases it asymptotically obtains the cosmological constant value $-1$. Finally, we perform observational confrontation with Supernova Type Ia (SNIa), Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) datasets, showing that the scenario is in agreement with observations.</p>

<p>2025-03-31, <strong>EP240414a: Off-axis View of a Jet-Cocoon System from an Expanded Progenitor Star</strong>, Jian-He Zheng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24266v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.24266v1</a></p>

<p>When a relativistic jet is launched following the core-collapse of a star, its interaction with the stellar envelope leads to the formation of a hot cocoon, which produces various viewing-angle-dependent observational phenomena following the breakout from the surface. We study the observational signatures of fast X-ray transient (FXT) EP240414a, which may originate from a jet-cocoon system viewed slightly off-axis. In our model, (1) the prompt X-ray emission lasting $\sim! 100\,{\rm{s}}$ is attributed to the cooling emission from the inner cocoon (shocked jet material); (2) the $\sim! 0.1\,{\rm{d}}$ X-ray emission comes from the inner cocoon’s afterglow; (3) the $\sim! 0.4\,{\rm{d}}$ thermal-dominated optical emission arises from the cooling of the outer cocoon (shocked stellar material); (4) the $\sim! 3\,{\rm{d}}$ non-thermal optical component and subsequent radio emission can be explained by the afterglow from a jet with a viewing angle of $10^{\circ}\lesssim \theta_{\rm{v}}\lesssim15^\circ$; and (5) the associated broad-lined Type Ic supernova only dominates the optical emission after $\sim! 7\rm\, d$. Both the jet inferred from the off-axis afterglow and the inner cocoon constrained by the cooling emission are found to have similar kinetic energies, on the order of $10^{51}\,{\rm{erg}}$. We find that the progenitor’s radius is $\sim3\,R_\odot$ as constrained by the { inner cocoon’s} cooling emissions, indicating that the pre-explosion star may be a massive helium star that is slightly inflated. More FXTs associated with off-axis jets and supernovae will be further examined by the Einstein Probe, leading to a deeper understanding of jet-cocoon systems.</p>

<p>2025-03-31, <strong>Data-Driven Forecasting of High-Dimensional Transient and Stationary Processes via Space-Time Projection</strong>, Oliver T. Schmidt et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23686v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.23686v1</a></p>

<p>Space-Time Projection (STP) is introduced as a data-driven forecasting approach for high-dimensional and time-resolved data. The method computes extended space-time proper orthogonal modes from training data spanning a prediction horizon comprising both hindcast and forecast intervals. Forecasts are then generated by projecting the hindcast portion of these modes onto new data, simultaneously leveraging their orthogonality and optimal correlation with the forecast extension. Rooted in Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) theory, dimensionality reduction and time-delay embedding are intrinsic to the approach. For a given ensemble and fixed prediction horizon, the only tunable parameter is the truncation rank–no additional hyperparameters are required. The hindcast accuracy serves as a reliable indicator for short-term forecast accuracy and establishes a lower bound on forecast errors. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated using two datasets: transient, highly anisotropic simulations of supernova explosions in a turbulent interstellar medium, and experimental velocity fields of a turbulent high-subsonic engineering flow. In a comparative study with standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks–acknowledging that alternative architectures or training strategies may yield different outcomes–the method consistently provided more accurate forecasts. Considering its simplicity and robust performance, STP offers an interpretable and competitive benchmark for forecasting high-dimensional transient and chaotic processes, relying purely on spatiotemporal correlation information.</p>

<p>2025-03-31, <strong>Dynamics of the intermediate-mass-element ejecta in the Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A studied with XRISM</strong>, Shunsuke Suzuki et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23640v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.23640v1</a></p>

<p>Supernova remnants (SNRs) provide crucial information of yet poorly understood mechanism of supernova explosion. Here we present XRISM high-resolution spectroscopy of the intermediate-mass-element (IME) ejecta in the SNR Cas A to determine their velocity distribution and thermal properties. The XRISM/Resolve spectrum in the 1.75-2.95 keV band extracted from each $1’ \times 1’$ region in the southeast and northwest rims is fitted with a model consisting of two-component plasmas in non-equilibrium ionization with different radial velocities and ionization timescales. It is found that the more highly ionized component has a larger radial velocity, suggesting that this component is distributed in the outer layer and thus has been heated by the SNR reverse shock earlier. We also perform proper motion measurement of the highly ionized component (represented by the Si XIV Ly$\alpha$ emission), using archival Chandra data, to reconstruct the three-dimensional velocity of the outermost IME ejecta. The pre-shock (free expansion) velocity of these ejecta is estimated to range from 2400 to 7100 km s$^{-1}$, based on the thermal properties and the bulk velocity of the shocked ejecta. These velocities are consistent with theoretical predictions for a Type IIb supernova, in which the progenitor’s hydrogen envelope is largely stripped before the explosion. Furthermore, we find a substantial asymmetry in the distribution of the free expansion velocities, with the highest value toward the direction opposite to the proper motion of the neutron star (NS). This indicates the physical association between the asymmetric supernova explosion and NS kick.</p>
