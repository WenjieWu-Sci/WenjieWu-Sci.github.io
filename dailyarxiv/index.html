<p>2025-03-27, <strong>Transitioning to Memory Burden: Detectable Small Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter</strong>, Gia Dvali et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21740v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.21740v1</a></p>

<p>Mounting theoretical evidence suggests that black holes are subjected to the memory burden effect, implying that after certain time the information stored in them suppresses the decay rate. This effect opens up a new window for small primordial black holes (PBHs) below $10^{15}\,{\rm g}$ as dark matter. We show that the smooth transition from semi-classical evaporation to the memory-burdened phase strongly impacts observational bounds on the abundance of small PBHs. The most stringent constraints come from present-day fluxes of astrophysical particles. Remarkably, currently-transitioning small PBHs are detectable through high-energetic neutrino events.</p>

<p>2025-03-27, <strong>SBN@CERN: A short-baseline neutrino beam at CERN for high-precision cross-section measurements</strong>, F. Acerbi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21589v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.21589v1</a></p>

<p>A new generation of neutrino cross-section experiments at the GeV scale is crucial in the precision era of oscillation physics and lepton flavor studies. In this document, we present a novel neutrino beam design that leverages the experience and R&amp;D achievements of the NP06/ENUBET and NuTag Collaborations and explore its potential implementation at CERN. This beam enables flux monitoring at the percent level and provides a neutrino energy measurement independent of final state particle reconstruction at the neutrino detector. As a result, it eliminates the two primary sources of systematic uncertainty in cross-section measurements: flux normalization and energy bias caused by nuclear effects. We provide a detailed description of the beam technology and instrumentation, along with an overview of its physics potential, with particular emphasis on cross-sections relevant to DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande.</p>

<p>2025-03-27, <strong>Exploring the flavor structure of leptons via diffusion models</strong>, Satsuki Nishimura et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21432v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.21432v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a method to explore the flavor structure of leptons using diffusion models, which are known as one of generative artificial intelligence (generative AI). We consider a simple extension of the Standard Model with the type I seesaw mechanism and train a neural network to generate the neutrino mass matrix. By utilizing transfer learning, the diffusion model generates 104 solutions that are consistent with the neutrino mass squared differences and the leptonic mixing angles. The distributions of the CP phases and the sums of neutrino masses, which are not included in the conditional labels but are calculated from the solutions, exhibit non-trivial tendencies. In addition, the effective mass in neutrinoless double beta decay is concentrated near the boundaries of the existing confidence intervals, allowing us to verify the obtained solutions through future experiments. An inverse approach using the diffusion model is expected to facilitate the experimental verification of flavor models from a perspective distinct from conventional analytical methods.</p>

<p>2025-03-27, <strong>The Jiutian simulations for the CSST extra-galactic surveys</strong>, Jiaxin Han et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21368v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.21368v1</a></p>

<p>We provide an overview of the Jiutian simulations, a hybrid simulation suite for the China Space Survey Telescope (CSST) extragalactic surveys. It consists of four complementary modules: the primary runs with high resolutions under the fiducial concordance cosmology, the emulator runs exploring the parameter uncertainties around the fiducial cosmology, the reconstruction runs intended for recovering the observed Universe site by site, and the extension runs employing extended cosmologies beyond the standard model. For the primary runs, two independent pipelines are adopted to construct subhaloes and merger trees. On top of them, four sets of mock galaxy light-cone catalogs are produced from semi-analytical models and subhalo abundance matching, providing a variety of observational properties including galaxy SED, emission lines, lensing distortions, and mock images. The 129 emulator runs are used to train the CSST emulator, achieving one percent accuracy in predicting a variety of cosmological statistics over $k\leq 10 h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $z\leq 2$. The reconstruction runs employ a number of subgrid baryonic models to predict the evolution and galaxy population of certain regions in the real Universe with constrained initial conditions, enabling controlled investigation of galaxy formation on top of structure formation. The extension runs cover models with warm dark matter, $f(R)$ gravity, interacting dark energy, and nonzero neutrino masses, revealing differences in the cosmic structure under alternative cosmological models. We introduce the specifications for each run, the data products derived from them, the corresponding pipeline developments, and present some main tests. Using the primary runs, we also show that the subhalo peak mass functions of different levels are approximately universal. These simulations form a comprehensive and open library for the CSST surveys.</p>

<p>2025-03-27, <strong>Beautiful Majorana Higgses at Colliders</strong>, Benjamin Fuks et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21354v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.21354v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate a novel collider signature within the minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model, featuring a Higgs sector composed of a bi-doublet and two triplets. Our study focuses on a region of the parameter space where the $SU(2)_R$ charged gauge boson $W_R$ lies in the multi-TeV regime (3-100 TeV) and the additional Higgs states play a significant role. In this scenario, a heavy neutral Higgs boson $\Delta$ with a dominant $SU(2)_R$ triplet component can be produced in association with either a Standard Model Higgs boson or a massive weak boson. The subsequent decay of the heavy Higgs into Majorana neutrinos $N$ results in displaced lepton signatures, providing a striking manifestation of lepton number violation. Additionally, we explore how the production of $b$-jets in these processes can enhance hadron-collider sensitivity to such signals. A particularly compelling channel, $pp \to b \bar b NN$, offers the exciting possibility of simultaneously probing the spontaneous mass origin of both Dirac fermions and Majorana states. Based on an optimised event selection strategy and state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations, we outline the expected reach at the HL-LHC and future colliders. Our findings demonstrate that this channel probes a region of parameter space where the neutral Higgs triplet and heavy neutrino masses are relatively light ($m_\Delta \lesssim 250$ GeV, $m_N \lesssim 80$ GeV), indirectly constraining the $W_R$ boson to the deep multi-TeV domain, with sensitivity extending up to 70-80 TeV, effectively turning the LHC into a precision machine.</p>

<p>2025-03-27, <strong>Neutrino type identification for atmospheric neutrinos in a large homogeneous liquid scintillation detector</strong>, Jiaxi Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21353v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.21353v1</a></p>

<p>Atmospheric neutrino oscillations are important to the study of neutrino properties, including the neutrino mass ordering problem. A good capability to identify neutrinosâ flavor and neutrinos against antineutrinos is crucial in such measurements. In this paper, we present a machine-learning-based approach for identifying atmospheric neutrino events in a large homogeneous liquid scintillator detector. This method extracts features that reflect event topologies from PMT waveforms and uses them as input to machine learning models. In addition, neutron-capture information is utilized to achieve neutrino versus antineutrino discrimination. Preliminary performances based on Monte Carlo simulations are presented, which demonstrate such detectorâs potential in the future measurements of atmospheric neutrinos.</p>

<p>The neutrino sector is the least known in the Standard Model. We briefly review the open questions in neutrino physics and the future experimental prospects of answering them. We argue that a synergistic approach at multiple frontiers is needed.</p>

<p>2025-03-27, <strong>Large Scale Structure and the Cosmic Web</strong>, Rita Tojeiro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21759v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.21759v1</a></p>

<p>The formation and evolution of galaxies cannot be separated from large scale structure growth. Dark matter halos (and, therefore, galaxies) form and grow within the cosmic web - the classification of large-scale structure as distinct environments, namely voids, walls, filaments and nodes. Thanks to the rapid development of extragalactic spectroscopic redshift surveys and cosmological simulations over the last two decades, we are now able to measure the impact of the cosmic web on galaxies and halos in observations and in simulations. In this chapter we summarise the state of play in our understanding of the link between dark matter halos, galaxies, and the cosmic web.</p>

<p>2025-03-27, <strong>Three-Dimensional Stacking as a Line Intensity Mapping Statistic</strong>, D. A. Dunne et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21743v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.21743v1</a></p>

<p>Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is a growing technique that measures the integrated spectral-line emission from unresolved galaxies over a three-dimensional region of the Universe. Although LIM experiments ultimately aim to provide powerful cosmological constraints via auto-correlation, many LIM experiments are also designed to take advantage of overlapping galaxy surveys, enabling joint analyses of the two datasets. We introduce a flexible simulation pipeline that can generate mock galaxy surveys and mock LIM data simultaneously for the same population of simulated galaxies. Using this pipeline, we explore a simple joint analysis technique: three-dimensional co-addition (stacking) of LIM data on the positions of galaxies from a traditional galaxy catalogue. We test how the output of this technique reacts to changes in experimental design of both the LIM experiment and the galaxy survey, its sensitivity to various astrophysical parameters, and its susceptibility to common systematic errors. We find that an ideal catalogue for a stacking analysis targets as many high-mass dark matter halos as possible. We also find that the signal in a LIM stacking analysis originates almost entirely from the large-scale clustering of halos around the catalogue objects, rather than the catalogue objects themselves. While stacking is a sensitive and conceptually simple way to achieve a LIM detection, thus providing a valuable way to validate a LIM auto-correlation detection, it will likely require a full cross-correlation to achieve further characterization of the galaxy tracers involved, as the cosmological and astrophysical parameters we explore here have degenerate effects on the stack.</p>

<p>2025-03-27, <strong>Interacting dark sectors in light of DESI DR2</strong>, Rahul Shah et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21652v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.21652v1</a></p>

<p>Possible interaction between dark energy and dark matter has previously shown promise in alleviating the clustering tension, without exacerbating the Hubble tension, when BAO data from SDSS DR16 is combined with CMB and SNIa datasets. With the recent DESI BAO DR2, there is now a compelling need to re-evaluate this scenario. We combine DESI DR2 with Planck 2018 and Pantheon+ SNIa datasets to constrain interacting dark matter dark energy models, accounting for interaction effects in both the background and perturbation sectors. Our results exhibit similar trends to those observed with SDSS, albeit with improved precision, reinforcing the consistency between the two BAO datasets. In addition to offering a resolution to the $S_8$ tension, in the phantom-limit, the dark energy equation of state exhibits an early-phantom behaviour, aligning with DESI DR2 findings, before transitioning to $w\sim-1$ at lower redshifts, regardless of the DE parametrization. However, the statistical significance of excluding $w=-1$ is reduced compared to their non-interacting counterparts.</p>

<p>2025-03-27, <strong>Polarized equatorial emission and hot spots around black holes with a dark matter halo</strong>, Tsanimir Angelov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21395v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.21395v1</a></p>

<p>We study the linear polarization of the accretion disk around black holes with a dark matter halo. The interaction of the black hole with the dark matter is modelled by considering an exact solution to the Einstein equations which describes a superposition of the Schwarzschild black hole with a Hernquist-type matter distribution. We simulate the observable polarization of a magnetized fluid ring orbiting around the black hole and evaluate the influence of the dark matter halo on its properties for physical parameters compatible with the dark matter distribution in galaxies. The polarization intensity and direction of the direct images deviate with less than $1\%$ from the isolated Schwarzschild black hole for a range of magnetic field configurations. For the indirect images the deviation increases with an order of magnitude but still remains under $10\%$ for small inclination angles corresponding to the galactic targets M87* and Sgr A*. This makes the detection of the dark matter impact on the polarized emission from the accretion disk extremely challenging in the near future.</p>

<p>2025-03-27, <strong>Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry</strong>, Antun Balaz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21366v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.21366v1</a></p>

<p>Long-baseline atom interferometry is a promising technique for probing various aspects of fundamental physics, astrophysics and cosmology, including searches for ultralight dark matter (ULDM) and for gravitational waves (GWs) in the frequency range around 1~Hz that is not covered by present and planned detectors using laser interferometry. The MAGIS detector is under construction at Fermilab, as is the MIGA detector in France. The PX46 access shaft to the LHC has been identified as a very suitable site for an atom interferometer of height $\sim 100$m, sites at the Boulby mine in the UK and the Canfranc Laboratory are also under investigation, and possible sites for km-class detectors have been suggested. The Terrestrial Very-Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration proposes a coordinated programme of interferometers of increasing baselines.</p>

<p>2025-03-27, <strong>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). The Euclid view on Planck galaxy protocluster candidates: towards a probe of the highest sites of star formation at cosmic noon</strong>, Euclid Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21304v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.21304v1</a></p>

<p>We search for galaxy protoclusters at redshifts $z &gt; 1.5$ in the first data release (Q1) of the $\textit{Euclid}$ survey. We make use of the catalogues delivered by the $\textit{Euclid}$ Science Ground Segment (SGS). After a galaxy selection on the $H_\textrm{E}$ magnitude and on the photometric redshift quality, we undertake the search using the $\texttt{DETECTIFz}$ algorithm, an overdensity finder based on Delaunay tessellation that uses photometric redshift probability distributions through Monte Carlo simulations. In this pilot study, we conduct a search in the 11 $\textit{Euclid}$ tiles that contain previously known $\textit{Planck}$ high star-forming galaxy protocluster candidates and focus on the two detections that coincide with these regions. These counterparts lie at photometric redshifts $z_\textrm{ph}=1.63^{+0.19}_{-0.23}$ and $z_\textrm{ph}=1.56^{+0.18}_{-0.21}$ and have both been confirmed by two other independent protocluster detection algorithms. We study their colours, their derived stellar masses and star-formation rates, and we estimate their halo mass lower limits. We investigate whether we are intercepting these galaxy overdensities in their `dyingâ phase, such that the high star-formation rates would be due to their last unsustainable starburst before transitioning to groups or clusters of galaxies. Indeed, some galaxy members are found to lie above the main sequence of galaxies (star-formation rate versus stellar mass). These overdense regions occupy a specific position in the dark matter halo mass / redshift plane where forming galaxy clusters are expected to have experienced a transition between cold flows to shock heating in the halo. Finally, we empirically update the potential for galaxy protocluster discoveries at redshift up to $z \simeq3$ (wide survey) and $z \simeq5.5$ (deep survey) with $\textit{Euclid}$ for the next data release (DR1).</p>

<p>2025-03-27, <strong>Simultaneous Formation of the Andromeda Giant Southern Stream and the Substructures in the Andromeda Halo</strong>, Misa Yamaguchi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21217v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.21217v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate a minor merger event in M31 that simultaneously forms the Andromeda Giant Southern Stream (AGSS), Eastern Extent (EE), North-Eastern Shelf (NES), and Western Shel (WS), offering a unified model for these substructures. By varying the scale radius and mass of the progenitorâs dark matter halo (DMH), around the range predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM model, we successfully reproduce the spatial features of these substructures. Across the limited range of parameters considered in this study, our analysis shows that the spatial evolution of NES and WS is independent of the gravitational potential of the DMH associated with the progenitor, while a shallower potential shifts EE further north. The simulations clearly demonstrate that the progenitor with a DMH mass of $9\times10^9M_\odot$ colliding with M31 850 Myr ago could simultaneously form al thes esubstructures. The simulation results indicate that EE lies several 10kpc closer to us than the aligned Stream Cp, which is actually a metal-poor component of Stream C, whose farther distance suggests overlapping debris from distinct collision events, while both remain closely aligned in celestial coordinates. Furthermore, we predict the existence of a positive stream along the AGSS, characterized by positive line-of-sight velocities relative to M31, which complements an already observed negative stream exhibiting negative line-of-sight velocities. Finally, we propose that three objects, namely Stream B, a metal-rich component of Stream C known as Stream Cr, and EE, are components of the Andromeda Giant Southern Arc (AGSA) connected to the AGSS. Although the existence of the positive stream and a complete picture of AGSA have yet to be confirmed observationally, we anticipate that future spectroscopic observations and further advances in theoretical studies will verify their existence.</p>

<p>2025-03-27, <strong>Lepton collider imprints of Inelastic dark matter model</strong>, Wei Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21083v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.21083v1</a></p>

<p>We explore the potential for detecting the inelastic dark model (DM) with an additional $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry at various types of lepton colliders. The new gauge boson $Zâ$ resulting from the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_D$ can act as a portal connecting the Standard Model fermions and DM fermions $\chi$, thereby facilitating the production of $Zâ$ and its decay into DM fermions. The mass difference between the excited DM fermion $\chi_2$ and the ground DM fermion $\chi_1$ induces the subsequent decays $\chi_2\to \chi_1 +\text{vis}$, where $\chi_2$ and $\chi_1$ serve as long lived particles and DM candidate, respectively. For the inelastic DM with a mass $m_{\chi_1}$ in the range of (1-100) GeV, we find that the future lepton colliders can probe many regions not accessible by current experiments and provide greater projected sensitivity than the LHC and Belle in previous studies. This suggests that future colliders can provide complementary exploration of the inelastic dark matter model.</p>

<p>Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) are predicted thermonuclear explosions of massive stars with helium core masses exceeding $\sim 65M_\odot$ and synthesize substantial amounts of radioactive $\mathrm{^{56}Ni}$ ($M(\mathrm{^{56}Ni})\sim60M_\odot$ in extreme cases). To investigate their observational signatures, we developed a 1D Monte Carlo radiation transport code and performed simulations of gamma-ray and hard X-ray emissions from the decay chain $\mathrm{^{56}Ni}\to\mathrm{^{56}Co}\to\mathrm{^{56}Fe}$. We find that key gamma-ray lines (847 and 1238 keV) from $\mathrm{^{56}Co}$ decay in the $130M_\odot$ helium core model can be detected up to 300-400 Mpc by next-generation MeV gamma-ray telescopes. In contrast, the signals from the $100M_\odot$ model remain below the detection limits. Our results provide the template for gamma-ray follow-up observations of PISNe. Considering theoretical predictions and observational constraints, we estimate PISN event rates within 300 Mpc to be approximately 0.1 events per year, highlighting their rarity but also emphasizing their feasibility as targets for future gamma-ray observations over the decade.</p>

<p>Pulsars are one of the possible final stages in the evolution of massive stars. If a supernova explosion is anisotropic, it can give the pulsar a powerful kick, propelling it to supersonic speeds. The resulting pulsar wind nebula is significantly reshaped by its interaction with the surrounding medium as the pulsar moves through it. First, the pulsar crosses the supernova remnant, followed by the different layers of circumstellar medium formed during different stages of the progenitor star s evolution. We aim to investigate how the evolutionary history of massive stars shapes the bow shock nebulae of runaway kicked pulsars, and how these influences in turn affect the dynamics and non-thermal radio emission of the entire pulsar remnant. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the PLUTO code to model the pulsar wind nebula generated by a runaway pulsar in the supernova remnant of a red supergiant progenitor, and derive its non-thermal radio emission. The supernova remnant and the pre-supernova circumstellar medium of the progenitor strongly confine and reshape the pulsar wind nebula of the runaway pulsar, bending its two side jets inwards and giving the nebula an arched shape for an observer perpendicular to the jets and the propagation direction, as observed around PSR J1509 5850 and Gemina. We perform the first classical 3D model of a pulsar moving inward through its supernova ejecta and circumstellar medium, inducing a bending of its polar jet that turns into characteristic radio synchrotron signature. The circumstellar medium of young runaway pulsars has a significant influence on the morphology and emission of pulsar wind nebulae, whose comprehension requires a detailed understanding of the evolutionary history of the progenitor star.</p>

<p>2025-03-27, <strong>Constraints on AvERA Cosmologies from Cosmic Chronometers and Type Ia Supernovae</strong>, Adrienn Pataki et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21369v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.21369v1</a></p>

<p>We constrain AvERA cosmologies in comparison with the flat $\Lambda$CDM model using cosmic chronometer (CC) data and the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The analysis includes CC fits performed with the \texttt{emcee} sampler and supernova fits based on a custom Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation. For model comparison, we apply Anderson-Darling tests on normalized residuals to assess consistency with a standard normal distribution. Best-fit parameters are derived within the redshift ranges $z \leq 2$ for CCs and $z \leq 2.3$ for SNe. The best-fit values of the Hubble constant are ${H_0=68.28_{-3.24}^{+3.23}~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ from the CC analysis and ${H_0=71.99_{-1.03}^{+1.05}~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ from the SN analysis, for the AvERA cosmology. These results are consistent within $1\sigma$ with the corresponding AvERA simulation value of $H(z=0)$. Both the CC and SN datasets substantially favor AvERA cosmologies over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We have identified signs of overfitting in both models, which suggests the possibility of overestimating the uncertainties in the Pantheon+ covariance matrix.</p>

<p>2025-03-27, <strong>Study of the origin of the azimuthal variation of synchrotron X-ray spectrum from SNR RX J0852.0-4622</strong>, Dai Tateishi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21331v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.21331v1</a></p>

<p>We report the azimuthal distribution of the X-ray energy spectrum of non-thermal dominant supernova remnant RX J0852.0$-$4622. The X-rays from the shock region observed by the X-ray astronomy satellite Suzaku/XIS in the energy range of 2-8 keV are well described by the absorbed power-law model and can be parameterized with flux and photon index. The X-ray flux and photon index are bimodally distributed in relation to the azimuthal angle. To understand its origin, we examined three possible causes: azimuthal variation by (1) the galactic magnetic field, (2) cloud density, and (3) shock velocity. From the polarization observations of stars near the SNR, we find that the Galactic magnetic field around the SNR is not aligned. This result leads us to conclude that the azimuthal variation of the X-ray spectrum is most likely not caused by the Galactic magnetic field. The X-ray fluxes are positively correlated with the cloud density with a significance of $\sim 5\sigma$, and the azimuthal distributions of these physical quantities are particularly pronounced in the northern part of the SNR. In addition, the X-ray fluxes on the southern part of the SNR are positively correlated with the shock velocity. This phenomenon can be qualitatively explained by the increase in roll-off energy due to the amplification of the magnetic field by (A) the interaction between the shock and dense clouds in the north and (B) the fast shock velocity in the south of the SNR. Since the shock velocity is likely related to the cloud density interacting with the shock, we conclude that the azimuthal variation of cloud density most likely causes the azimuthal variations of the X-ray flux and photon index.</p>

<p>2025-03-27, <strong>Proper Motion and Natal Kick in the Galactic Black Hole X-ray Binary AT2019wey</strong>, Lang Cui et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21119v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2503.21119v1</a></p>

<p>Understanding the formation mechanisms of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries (BHXBs) remains a fundamental challenge in astrophysics. The natal kick velocities imparted during black hole formation provide crucial constraints on these formation channels. In this work, we present a new-epoch very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observation of the Galactic BHXB AT2019wey carried out in 2023. Combining with archival VLBI data from 2020, we successfully measure the proper motion of AT2019wey over a 3-year timescale, namely $0.78\pm0.12$~\masyr\ in right ascension and $-0.42\pm0.07$~\masyr\ in declination. Employing the measured proper motion, we estimate its peculiar velocity and the potential kick velocity (PKV), through Monte Carlo simulations incorporating uncertainties of its distance and radial velocity. The estimated PKV distributions and height above the Galactic plane suggest that AT2019weyâs black hole likely formed through a supernova explosion rather than direct collapse.</p>
