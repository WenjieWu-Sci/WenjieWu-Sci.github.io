<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Towards the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND): the GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger prototypes</strong>, GRAND Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21306v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.21306v1</a></p>

<p>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a proposed multi-messenger observatory of ultra-high-energy (UHE) particles of cosmic origin. Its main goal is to find the long-sought origin of UHE cosmic rays by detecting large numbers of them and the secondary particles created by their interaction – gamma rays, and, especially, neutrinos. GRAND will do so using large arrays of radio antennas that look for the radio signals emitted by the air showers initiated by the interactions of the UHE particles in the atmosphere. Since 2023, three small-scale prototype GRAND arrays have been in operation: GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay in France, GRAND@Auger in Argentina, and GRANDProto300 in China. Together, their goal is to validate the detection principle of GRAND under prolonged field conditions, achieving efficient, autonomous radio-detection of air showers. We describe the hardware, software, layout, and operation of the GRAND prototypes and show the first radio spectra measured by them. Despite challenges, the successful operation of the prototypes confirms that the GRAND instrumentation is apt to address the goals of the experiment and lays the groundwork for its ensuing stages.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>First results from LEGEND-200 on the search for neutrinoless double beta decay</strong>, Giovanna Saleh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21166v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.21166v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) is a rare process which could take place if neutrinos are Majorana fermions: the observation of this decay would provide unambiguous evidence for the existence of new Physics beyond the Standard Model, as it entails a two-units lepton number violation. The LEGEND experiment (Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ Decay) searches for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ of $^{76}$Ge using High Purity Germanium detectors enriched in $^{76}$Ge beyond the 86%. The LEGEND project foresees two phases, LEGEND-200, aiming at a final 3$\sigma$ discovery sensitivity beyond 10$^{27}$ yr, and LEGEND-1000, aiming at a final sensitivity beyond 10$^{28}$ yr. LEGEND-200 started taking data in 2023 at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS): in about one year it collected a total physics exposure of 61 kg yr, with a background index of $0.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2} \cdot 10^{-3}$ counts/(keV kg yr) in the so-called “golden dataset” and of $1.3^{+0.8}_{-0.5} \cdot 10^{-3}$ counts/(keV kg yr) in the so-called “silver dataset”. The performed statistical analysis finds no evidence for a $0\nu\beta\beta$ signal and sets a lower limit on its half life to $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} &gt; 0.5 \cdot 10^{26}$ yr at 90% CL. A combined analysis of the three germanium-based $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments GERDA, MAJORANA Demonstrator and LEGEND-200 provides a lower limit of $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} &gt; 1.9 \cdot 10^{26}$ yr at 90% CL.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>High energy gammas and neutrinos from the Sun, Jupiter and Earth</strong>, Pablo de la Torre et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20970v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20970v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmic rays reaching the atmosphere of an astrophysical object produce showers of secondary particles that may then scape into space. Here we obtain the flux of gammas and neutrinos of energy $E&gt;10$ GeV emited by the Sun, Jupiter and Earth. We show that, while the solar magnetic field induces an albedo flux of gammas from all the points in the Sun’s surface, the dipolar magnetic field in the planets implies gammas only from the very peripheral region. Neutrinos, in contrast, can cross these objects and emerge from any point in their surface. The emission from these astrophysical objects is above the diffuse flux from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium and has a distinct spectrum and gamma to neutrino ratio.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Techniques for Continuous Wave Identification and Filtering in the Askaryan Radio Array</strong>, Mohammad Ful Hossain Seikh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20735v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20735v1</a></p>

<p>The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), located near the South Pole, is among the first experiments there designed to detect ultra-high energy neutrinos through the Askaryan effect. When such neutrinos interact in dense media like ice, they initiate particle cascades that generate coherent radio pulses. Operating in the 150-850 MHz band, ARA is deployed 80-200 meters deep in Antarctic ice, where the radio background is exceptionally low. Despite this, experiments such as ARA must still account for continuous wave (CW) signals, which can originate from anthropogenic sources, instrumental noise, and other environmental factors. These CW signals can obscure faint neutrino-induced pulses, complicating data analysis and event identification. Over the years, ARA has developed and refined techniques for CW filtering and identification, including spectral analysis, notch filtering, and phase-variance methods. These approaches exploit CW characteristics such as their narrowband nature and persistence to separate contamination from genuine impulsive events. We review the main CW identification and filtering techniques developed within the ARA collaboration and present recent improvements in adaptive, multi-stage filtering pipelines. These advances have led to faster processing, simpler operation, and more accurate CW suppression, improving data analysis quality. Their efficacy is demonstrated across all ARA stations, underscoring their role in reducing event misclassification and enhancing performance. By refining these techniques, this work not only improves the sensitivity of ARA but also highlights the importance of robust CW filtering for current and future neutrino radio detection experiments.</p>

<p>We summarize the motivation for (as well as the presentations from) the April, 2024 workshop held in India and focused on radiowave techniques for cosmic ray and neutrino detection.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Reconciling the Tension Between Light Curve Modeling of Type II Supernovae and Neutrino-Driven Core-Collapse Supernovae Models with Late-Phase Spectroscopy</strong>, Qiliang Fang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20675v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20675v1</a></p>

<p>Type II supernovae (SNe II) are the most frequently observed outcome of core-collapse explosions and provide a valuable window into the physical mechanisms governing the deaths of massive stars. However, estimates of explosion properties based on optical light curve modeling often show tension with the predictions of modern neutrino-driven explosion models. In particular, when based on light curves from the explosions of red supergiant (RSG) tied to specific stellar wind models, many SNe II are found to originate from low-mass progenitors yet exhibit unusually high explosion energies ($E_{\rm K}$), far exceeding theoretical predictions. In this study, we incorporate late-phase (nebular) spectroscopy to estimate the helium core mass of the progenitor ($M_{\rm He\,core}$), which serves as an additional constraint to break degeneracies in light curve modeling. This approach is applied to a sample of 32 well-observed SNe II, using a light curve model grid constructed from RSGs with arbitrarily stripped hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than assuming a fixed wind model. Examining the resulting correlations among the physical parameters, we find that the tension between the observed $M_{\rm He\,core}$-$E_{\rm K}$ and $E_{\rm K}$-$M_{\rm Ni}$ relations and those predicted by neutrino-driven explosion models has significantly lessened by incorporating nebular spectroscopy in light curve modeling. This study highlights the crucial role of nebular spectroscopy in interpreting SNe II observations and provides support to the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism as the dominant engine powering these events.</p>

<p>2025-09-24, <strong>Searching for sub-eV Sterile Neutrinos in Neutrino Telescopes</strong>, Emilse Cabrera et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20442v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20442v1</a></p>

<p>With the forthcoming deployment of IceCube-Upgrade, unprecedented statistics of atmospheric neutrinos in the energy range (1-100) GeV will become available, providing a valuable opportunity to probe physics beyond the Standard Model in the neutrino sector. In this study, we calculate the sensitivity of the IceCube-Upgrade to sterile neutrinos with mass-squared splittings $\lesssim 1~{\rm eV}^2$. We demonstrate that, particularly due to the (1-10) GeV energy window, $\nu_\mu-\nu_s$ mixing angles as small as $\sim5^\circ$ can be probed by IceCube-Upgrade for all mass-squared splittings below $1~{\rm eV}^2$. Furthermore, we investigate the potential impact of a sterile neutrino state on the precision determination of standard atmospheric neutrino mixing parameters in the IceCube-Upgrade.</p>

<p>2025-09-24, <strong>Directly Probing Neutrino Interactions through CMB Phase Shift Measurements</strong>, Gabriele Montefalcone et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20363v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20363v1</a></p>

<p>Perturbations in the cosmic neutrino background produce a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic oscillations imprinted in the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), providing a unique observational probe of neutrino physics. In this work, we explore how this phase shift signature is altered in the presence of neutrino interactions with temperature-dependent scattering rates, motivated by physical constructions for neutrino self-interactions and neutrino-dark matter couplings. A key finding is that the phase shift in these realistic models – characterized by gradual rather than instantaneous decoupling – maintains the same functional form as the free-streaming template, with only the asymptotic amplitude decreasing for stronger interactions that delay decoupling. This simple parametrization enables us to directly constrain neutrino interactions through phase shift measurements in the temperature and polarization power spectra from CMB observations. Analyzing the latest data from \textit{Planck}, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and the South Pole Telescope, we derive strong constraints on the neutrino decoupling redshift. Our global analysis indicates that neutrinos have been freely streaming since deep within the radiation-dominated epoch. We also explore flavor-dependent scenarios in which only one neutrino species interacts. Overall, our work establishes a signature-driven framework that exploits the clean phase shift signal in the acoustic oscillations of the CMB as a precise and robust probe of non-standard neutrino interactions in the early universe.</p>

<p>2025-09-24, <strong>Probing Beyond the Standard Model Scenarios in Long-baseline and Astrophysical Neutrino Experiments</strong>, Sudipta Das et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20348v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20348v1</a></p>

<p>Over the past few decades, outstanding progress in the neutrino experiment frontier has greatly advanced our understanding of the flavor oscillations of active neutrinos. The remaining key questions such as the neutrino mass ordering, the presence of CP violation in the lepton sector, and the octant of $\theta_{23}$ are expected to be resolved in the coming years. The current precise knowledge of neutrino mass and mixing parameters, together with the promising prospects of next-generation neutrino experiments, provides a unique opportunity to test scenarios beyond the Standard Model (BSM) through neutrino oscillation phenomena. This thesis investigates several such BSM scenarios and examines the capability of the next-generation neutrino experiments to probe them.</p>

<p>2025-09-24, <strong>Effect of Cosmic Neutrino Background on the Dark Matter Self-interaction via Neutrino force</strong>, Pawin Ittisamai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20170v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20170v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrino-pair exchange induces a neutrino force that can drive dark matter (DM) self-interactions and impact small-scale structure formation. In the presence of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B), this force can be modified, with important consequences for DM phenomenology. We study the effect of the C$\nu$B on neutrino forces, generated by the scalar and pseudoscalar interactions. We explore the significance of the background neutrino force on the scalar DM-neutrino portal model, including DM self-scattering and annihilation. Our results show that the interplay between attractive vacuum potential and repulsive background potential leads to a screening effect that varies across DM mass ($m_\chi$) regimes, strongly affecting DM self-scattering in the DM mass $m_\nu \lesssim m_\chi \lesssim T_{C \nu B}$. By contrast, the impact on DM annihilation is negligible. Overall, the C$\nu$B substantially reshapes the viable coupling range for DM self-interactions while remaining compatible with current constraints, offering a pathway to small-scale structure problems.</p>

<p>2025-09-24, <strong>Studies on Response Uniformity of RPC and Exploring Oscillation Dip and Valley, Non-Standard Interactions, and Earth’s Core using Atmospheric Neutrinos at ICAL-INO detector</strong>, Anil Kumar et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20094v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20094v1</a></p>

<p>In this thesis, experimental and physics simulation studies are performed in the context of the proposed 50 kt Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). ICAL would detect atmospheric muon neutrinos and antineutrinos separately in the multi-GeV range of energies over a wide range of baselines. In the experimental part of the thesis, the effect of the non-uniformity of the graphite layer on the detector response of the resistive plate chamber is studied. In the physics simulation part, it is demonstrated for the first time that the neutrino oscillation dip and valley can be observed at ICAL using the up/down ratio of reconstructed muons and antimuons separately. A method is formulated such that the location of the dip and the alignment of the valley can be used to measure an atmospheric oscillation parameter called the mass-squared difference. Further, a new approach is proposed to probe the neutral-current non-standard interactions (NSIs) using the oscillation dip and valley. The opposite shifts in the oscillation dips and the contrast in the curvatures of oscillation valleys for reconstructed muons and antimuons are used to constrain the NSI parameter in two separate ways. While passing through the Earth, the upward-going atmospheric neutrinos experience the matter effects, which modify the neutrino oscillation patterns. These matter effects depend upon the density of electrons inside Earth and can be used to perform the neutrino oscillation tomography of Earth, complementary to gravitational measurements and seismic studies. This work demonstrates that the presence of Earth’s core can be validated using the atmospheric neutrinos at ICAL.</p>

<p>2025-09-24, <strong>Jet-driven explosion of an accretion-induced white-dwarf collapse via a magnetorotational dynamo</strong>, Luciano Combi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19799v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.19799v1</a></p>

<p>The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a rotating white dwarf (WD) offers a potential site of millisecond pulsars/magnetars, gamma-ray bursts, and r-process nucleosynthesis. We present three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations including neutrinos of magnetorotational AIC, assuming the WD is rapidly spinning with a weak magnetic field confined below its surface (likely a prerequisite for rapid rotation). Within milliseconds after core bounce, the magnetic field is exponentially amplified near the surface of the proto-neutron star (PNS). We witness the emergence of a small-scale turbulent and mean-field, large-scale MRI-driven dynamo in the neutrino-cooled centrifugally supported disk formed around the PNS, which generates bundles of large-scale toroidal field with alternating polarity. The amplified field becomes buoyant and is advected above the PNS, generating a magnetic tower that drives a mildly relativistic striped jet. The jet breaks out of the WD, clearing the way for a powerful magnetized neutron-rich wind from the disk. Although our simulation cannot follow the long-term Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling phase of the PNS, the conditions are ripe for the formation of a GRB powered by magnetar spin-down. A similar dynamo may operate in magnetorotational core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Primordial black holes formation in inflationary $F(R)$ models with scalar fields</strong>, E. O. Pozdeeva et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21220v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.21220v1</a></p>

<p>We construct $F(R)$ gravity models with scalar fields to describe cosmological inflation and formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By adding the induced gravity term and the fourth-order polynomial potential for the scalar field to the known $F(R)$ gravity model, and using a conformal transformation of the metric, we obtain a two-field chiral cosmological model. For some values of the model parameters, we get that the inflationary parameters of this model are in good agreement with the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation obtained by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The estimation of PBH masses suggests that PBHs could be dark matter candidates.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Probing Light Dark Matter with Cosmic Gravitational Focusing</strong>, Shao-Feng Ge et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21213v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.21213v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the possibility of using the cosmic gravitational focusing (CGF) to probe the minor light dark matter (DM) component whose mass is in the range of $(0.1 \sim 100)$\,eV. Being a purely gravitational effect, the CGF offers a mode-independent probe that is complementary to the existing ways such as Lyman-$\alpha$ and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Such effect finally leads to a dipole density distribution that would affect the galaxy formation and hence can be reconstructed with galaxy surveys such as DESI. Both the free-streaming and clustering limits have been studied with analytical formulas while the region in between is bridged with interpolation. We show the projected sensitivity at DESI with the typical phase space distribution of a freeze-in DM scenario as illustration.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Gravitational waves from two scalar fields unifying the dark sector with inflation</strong>, Orlando Luongo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21200v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.21200v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the gravitational-wave background predicted by a two-scalar-field cosmological model that aims to unify primordial inflation with the dark sector, namely late-time dark energy and dark matter, in a single and self-consistent theoretical framework. The model is constructed from an action inspired by several extensions of general relativity and string-inspired scenarios and features a non-minimal interaction between the two scalar fields, while both remain minimally coupled to gravity. In this context, we derive the gravitational-wave energy spectrum over wavelengths ranging from today’s Hubble horizon to those at the end of inflation. We employ the continuous Bogoliubov coefficient formalism, originally introduced to describe particle creation in an expanding Universe, in analogy to the well-established mechanism of gravitational particle production and, in particular, generalized to gravitons. Using this method, which enables an accurate description of graviton creation across all cosmological epochs, we find that inflation provides the dominant gravitational-wave contribution, while subdominant features arise at the inflation-radiation, radiation-matter, and matter-dark energy transitions, i.e., epochs naturally encoded inside our scalar field picture. The resulting energy density spectrum is thus compared with the sensitivity curves of the planned next-generation ground- and space-based gravitational-wave observatories.

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Scalaron dark matter dynamics: effects of Higgs non-minimal coupling to gravity</strong>, Shibendu Gupta Choudhury et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21148v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.21148v1</a></p>

<p>One of the key features of the $R^2$-gravity is the embedding of a scalar field, scalaron, into the gravity sector. The scalaron interacts with the Standard Model (SM) matter fields through Planck-suppressed couplings. If the scalaron serves as a viable dark matter (DM) candidate, it can account for the lack of evidence of DM interactions beyond gravity in experimental and observational probes to date. The realization of the scalaron, as a cold DM candidate, depends on an induced trilinear interaction with the SM Higgs, despite its suppressed coupling strength. Here, we introduce a Higgs non-minimal coupling to gravity that additionally contributes to the induced trilinear interaction with its existing competing part, originated from the $R^2$-gravity. We study the interplay between these two contributions in the early universe, which determines both the initial conditions and evolution of the scalaron, leading to cold DM behavior at a later epoch. The trilinear interaction vanish identically for certain combinations of the Higgs non-minimal coupling and the scalaron mass, thereby setting the scalaron density through misalignment mechanism, similar to axions. Consequently, we find that the observed DM relic density is obtained for a scalaron mass between $1.38$ keV and $0.7$ MeV. The lower limit on the mass stems from the LHC constraints on the Higgs non-minimal coupling, whereas the upper bound arises from INTEGRAL/SPI limits on the excess gamma-ray flux from possible scalaron decays to two photons.</p>

<p>High intensity muon beams open new avenues for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we propose a muonium-based experiment to search for ultralight axions dark matter through resonant quantum transitions between hyperfine states. Combining theoretical calculation with simulation results, we show that a muon beam with a realistic intensity of $10^5 \rm /s$ in the $\mathcal{O}(10~\text{keV})$ energy range could improve constraints on the axion-muon coupling by {up to seven orders of magnitude compared with existing muon $g-2$ limit, over the axion mass range $10^{-15}$ eV$-10^{-5}$ eV}. These results establish muonium spectroscopy currently under construction in Huizhou, as a powerful new probe of physics beyond the Standard Model.</p>

<p>A new method was recently proposed for axion dark matter searches which employs scalable, permanently magnetized, flat conversion surface (or magnetized converter) generating an electromagnetic signal from dark matter particles passing through them. BRASS-p is an experimental setup which applies this method to direct searches of axion/ALP dark matter in the frequency range from 12 to 18 GHz (corresponding to the range of particle mass from 50 to 74 $\mu$eV. The conversion surface of BRASS-p will consist of 24 individual panels, each containing a 483mm $\times$ 483mm array of high-grade permanent magnets organized in a pattern capable of generating a magnetic field with an average strength of $\approx$ 0.9 T, for the field component parallel to the surface of the panel. This paper describes the development and optimization of a design for these panels and discusses the resulting sensitivity of BRASS-p measurements to the axion/ALP dark matter.</p>

<p>Quantum Gravity models suggest that singularities in gravitational collapse can be replaced by bounces, leading to the formation of Planck star remnants (PSR) that survive as stable relics once the black holes evaporate to the Planck mass. Recently, we proposed that such relics can be a viable candidate for dark matter. Here we show that LIGO’s upper limit on the gravitational wave background rules out a formation pathway of Planck mass relics as dark matter from Gaussian initial conditions. This leaves non-Gaussian primordial fluctuations as the only viable channel for making Planck mass relics as dark matter.</p>

<p>2025-09-24, <strong>Could regular primordial black holes be dark matter?</strong>, Mohsen Khodadi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20483v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20483v1</a></p>

<p>The recent proposal proposed by Paul Davies and colleagues [Phys. Rev. D \textbf{111} (2025) no.10, 103512] that regular primordial black holes (RPBHs) form stable, zero-temperature remnants and could thereby constitute dark matter is critically examined. While the introduction of a fundamental length scale indeed regulates the Hawking temperature, preventing its divergence, we show that the evaporation timescale for such RPBHs is infinite. This result holds generically for analytic regular black hole spacetimes under standard adiabatic and quasi-static evolution. Consequently, RPBHs never actually reach a true remnant state within any finite time, but instead persist as slowly evaporating objects with a non-zero luminosity. When the combined emission from a cosmological population of these near-remnants is considered, the resulting radiation is found to violate stringent observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background and extragalactic gamma-ray backgrounds. Therefore, low-mass RPBHs are not viable dark matter candidates.</p>

<p>We propose a novel collider probe of baryogenesis at TeV scale by measuring decay asymmetries into particle and anti-particle final states. Motivated by the idea of Dirac leptogenesis, we consider an extension of the standard model with new colored and $SU(2)_L$ singlet particles in such a way that the out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy colored fermions creates equal and opposite CP asymmetries in two sectors, prevented from equilibrating with each other. While the TeV scale viability of this mechanism requires a resonantly enhanced CP asymmetry, the latter also plays a crucial role leading to observable decay asymmetries in colliders. In addition to discussing conventional signatures of such heavy colored particles, namely, mono-jet plus missing transverse energy, displaced vertex, colored track at hadron colliders, we also show the unique possibility of measuring decay asymmetries via forward-backward and charge asymmetries at future muon colliders. In addition to being a verifiable TeV-scale baryogenesis scenario, the model also predicts a singlet scalar dark matter candidate consistent with the required thermal dark matter properties near the Higgs resonance.</p>

<p>2025-09-24, <strong>Dwarf galaxy halo masses from spectroscopic and photometric lensing in DESI and DES</strong>, Helena Treiber et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20434v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20434v1</a></p>

<p>We present the most precise and lowest-mass weak lensing measurements of dwarf galaxies to date, enabled by spectroscopic lenses from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and photometric lenses from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) calibrated with DESI redshifts. Using DESI spectroscopy from the first data release, we construct clean samples of galaxies with median stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_<em>/M_{\odot})=8.3-10.1$ and measure their weak lensing signals with sources from DES, KiDS, and SDSS, achieving detections with $S/N$ up to 14 for dwarf galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_</em>/M_{\odot})&lt;$9.25) – opening up a new regime for lensing measurements of low-mass systems. Leveraging DES photometry calibrated with DESI, we extend to a photometric dwarf sample of over 700,000 galaxies, enabling robust lensing detections of dwarf galaxies with combined $S/N=38$ and a significant measurement down to $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.0$. We show that the one-halo regime (scales $\lesssim 0.15h^{-1}\rm Mpc$) is insensitive to various systematic and sample selection effects, providing robust halo mass estimates, while the signal in the two-halo regime depends on galaxy color and environment. These results demonstrate that DESI already enables precise dwarf lensing measurements, and that calibrated photometric samples extend this capability. Together, they pave the way for novel constraints on dwarf galaxy formation and dark matter physics with upcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s LSST.</p>

<p>2025-09-24, <strong>Optical signatures of wormholes immersed in realistic dark matter halos</strong>, Abdullah Guvendi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20425v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20425v1</a></p>

<p>We develop an exact analytic framework for massless scalar-wave propagation in static, spherically symmetric wormholes embedded in realistic dark matter halos. Starting from a general line element with arbitrary redshift and shape functions, we derive the radial Klein-Gordon equation in Schr"odinger form, disentangling the effects of gravitational redshift, spatial curvature, and angular momentum. The dynamics reduce to a generalized Helmholtz equation with a space- and frequency-dependent effective refractive index that encodes throat geometry, halo curvature, and centrifugal contributions. In the asymptotic limit $r \to \infty$, the refractive index approaches unity, consistently recovering free-space propagation. Application to representative halo profiles, including the Navarro-Frenk-White model, the Thomas-Fermi Bose-Einstein condensate, and the Pseudo-Isothermal distribution, combined with zero, Teo-type, and cored redshift functions, reveals evanescent domains, quasi-bound states, and suppression of high-angular-momentum modes near the throat. High-frequency waves converge to the geometric-optics regime, whereas low-frequency modes undergo strong curvature-induced localization. This formalism establishes a non-perturbative link between wormhole geometry, halo structure, and redshift effects, providing a robust framework for scalar-wave phenomenology in astrophysical contexts.</p>

<p>We report the first calculation of light scattering on heavy dark matter (DM) particles. We show that despite the fact that DM has no direct coupling to photons, the light-DM($\gamma\chi$) ($m_\chi \sim 1$ TeV) cross-section is non-vanishing, albeit small. The cross section, calculated within the Standard Model (SM) framework, is particularly large in the case of heavy Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP). Combined with astrophysical observation, these results can constrain existing WIMP DM models in favor of lighter DM, $M_\chi«M_{\mathrm{Planck}}$, (axions, composite DM, etc..) or non-weakly interacting pure gravitational DM. We also show that the energy dependence of light scattering on dark matter should make the DM colored - red in the case of weak-DM and blue for the gravitational-DM, when a white background light is passing through. Gravitational scattering of light on DM particles also leads to non-trivial polarization effects, which might be easier to detect than the deflection of light from the scattering on DM particles, $\gamma\chi\rightarrow\gamma\chi$.</p>

<p>Dark matter (DM) and the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) are among the most compelling indications of physics beyond the Standard Model. We revisit the inelastic Higgs-portal complex singlet, a minimal framework in which a complex scalar splits into two nearly degenerate real states, with an off-diagonal Higgs-portal interaction that drives coannihilation to set the relic density, while the elastic DM-Higgs coupling can be tuned small enough to evade direct-detection limits. This setup naturally supports a strong first-order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT) and can account for the long-standing Galactic Center gamma-ray excess (GCE) via present-day DM annihilation into Higgs pairs. In this work, we show that the same framework, extended by a $Z_2$-symmetric dimension-6 $CP$-violating top Yukawa operator, can also generate the BAU via the electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) mechanism. The cosmological history involves a two-step electroweak phase transition: first, the singlet fields acquire nonzero vacuum expectation values (vevs); then a strongly first-order transition occurs in which the Higgs develops its nonzero vev while the singlet vevs vanish. During this second step, both fields remain nonzero only within the advancing bubble wall, generating wall-localized $CP$ violation that biases sphaleron transitions and enables EWBG. After the phase transition, $CP$ and $Z_2$ symmetries are restored: the lightest singlet state becomes a stable DM candidate, while the vanishing singlet vevs allow the model to naturally satisfy the stringent constraints on $CP$ violation. We delineate the SFOEWPT-favored parameter space, identifying the criteria for the two-step phase transition region that simultaneously yields the observed BAU and relic density, explains the GCE, and predicts gravitational wave spectra accessible to next-generation space-based detectors.</p>

<p>Researchers have long been interested in exotic states of matter. In the early 1970s, Migdal proposed the existence of metastable or stable nuclei containing a pion condensate, and Bodmer posited the existence of collapsed nuclei with a quark core. Lee and Wick proposed that compressed nuclear matter could undergo a phase transition into a scalar condensate state with effectively very light baryons. In the mid-1980s, Witten pointed out that strange quark matter may be an absolutely stable form of matter that can exist in the form of quark strangelets. These hypotheses stimulated large experimental efforts to detect these states in heavy-ion collisions and in terrestrial samples. Additionally, the cosmos is the arena for a broad search for traces of exotic matter in compact objects and other energetic phenomena. We review various approaches and arguments for the possibility of abnormal states of matter, including metastable and stable dense objects with condensates, as well as dilute nuclear objects. Among these, we discuss scalar condensate and p-wave and s-wave pion condensations in dense nuclear systems and the formation of a $\Delta$ resonance matter. Then we consider a scalar mode condensation triggered by the Pomeranchuk instability in dilute nuclear matter, and clustering. We also mention recent ideas that a relativistic rotation and a dark-matter component may stabilize abnormal nuclear systems. Finally, we list some observational anomalies that cannot yet be appropriately explained by conventional physics.</p>

<p>We present the “DARKSKIES” suite of one hundred, zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of massive ($M_{200}&gt;5\times10^{14}{\rm M}_\odot)$ galaxy clusters with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We super-sample the simulations such that $m_{\rm DM}/m_{\rm gas}\sim0.1$, enabling us to simulate a dark matter particle mass of $m=0.68\times10^{8}M_\odot$ an order of magnitude faster, whilst exploring SIDM in the core of clusters at extremely high resolution. We calibrate the baryonic feedback to produce observationally consistent and realistic galaxy clusters across all simulations and simulate five models of velocity-independent SIDM targeting the expected sensitivity of future telescopes - $\sigma_{\rm DM}/m=0.,0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2$ cm$^2$/g. We find the density profiles exhibit the characteristic core even in the smallest of cross-sections, with cores developing only at late times ($z&lt;0.5$). We investigate the dynamics of the brightest cluster galaxy inside the dark matter halo and find in SIDM cosmologies there exists a so-called wobbling not observed in collisionless dark matter. We find this wobble is driven by accreting mass on to a cored density profile with the signal peaking at $z=0.25$ and dropping thereafter. This finding is further supported by the existence of an anti-correlation between the offset between the BCG and the dark matter halo and its relative velocity in SIDM only, a hallmark of harmonic oscillation.</p>

<p>Microquasars are increasingly recognized as efficient particle accelerators, potentially contributing to the cosmic-ray flux up to the “knee”. Among them, SS 433 stands out as a unique system with precessing relativistic jets embedded within the W50 supernova remnant. Recent detections of very- and ultra-high-energy gamma rays from SS 433 have solidified its role as a key laboratory for studying particle acceleration in jet-powered astrophysical sources. We present results from over 100 hours of observations of SS 433 with VERITAS, spanning more than a decade. These high-resolution measurements allow for a detailed morphological study of the eastern and western jet lobes with an angular resolution of &lt;0.1{\deg}. By analyzing the spatial and spectral characteristics of the gamma-ray emission, we investigate the particle acceleration mechanisms within the jets and at the jet-medium interaction in W50.</p>

Truemam et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20956v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20956v1</a></p>

<p>Several short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) are know to have existed in the early Solar System (ESS). These species, which typically decay with half-lives of the order of a few million years, can be used to probe the timescale of events preceding the birth of the Sun. We investigate the ESS origin of $^{53}$Mn, produced by core-collapse (CCSNe) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and $^{60}$Fe, produced exclusively by CCSNe. We model the evolution of the radioactive-to-stable abundance ratios of these SLRs with a galactic chemical evolution (GCE) framework accounting for different supernova yields, SN Ia delay times, and other galactic features $(K)$. A further set of models are calculated assuming that SN Ia did not contribute any $^{53}$Mn to the ESS. The predicted ratios are compared to meteoritic ratios to derive a distribution of solar isolation times that includes uncertainties due to stochastic chemical enrichment and precision of the ESS values. The isolation times are then compared to those of $^{107}$Pd and $^{182}$Hf calculated in previous work. A self-consistent solution can be found within the current uncertainties, especially when using the GCE setups with $K = 1.6$ and 2.3, although the maximum likelihood for the \iso{60}Fe distribution is typically $\sim 4-5$ Myr shorter than for \iso{53}Mn. The predicted \iso{60}Fe/\iso{53}Mn ratio, instead, is completely inconsistent with the ESS value; this could be resolved using a larger fraction of faint CCSNe than usually considered in GCE models.</p>

<p>We discover an extended distribution of main-sequence (MS) stars along the minor axis of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). This study is enabled by deep, wide Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam data, reaching photometric uncertainties below 0.1 mag at $g,i \sim 26$ mag. Color-magnitude diagrams along the major and minor axes reveal a clear excess of MS stars beyond the nominal tidal radius along the minor axis. To characterize this structure, we derive radial number density profiles in seven azimuthal directions and fit them with an exponential+power-law function to assess the symmetry of the extended component. The power-law slopes tend to be shallower toward the minor axis, though the symmetry remains inconclusive within 1$\sigma$ uncertainties. This may indicate that the extended component is preferentially distributed along the minor axis, and could be different from the previously suggested tidal features along the major axis. Comparing with simulations, we find that the fraction of stars beyond five effective radii is consistent with expectations from an intermediate mass ratio merger scenario with a stellar mass ratio around 6:1. While these findings provide new insights into the structural complexity and dynamical history of the UMi dSph, alternative mechanisms such as stellar or supernova feedback have also been proposed for extended stellar halos in dwarfs and cannot be ruled out.</p>

<p>2025-09-25, <strong>Probing redshift-dependent systematics in the Hubble tension: Model-independent $H_0$ constraints from DESI R2</strong>, Tonghua Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20898v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20898v1</a></p>

<p>We present a model-independent determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) using the latest observational data from multiple cosmological probes. By combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the second data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR2), cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and the Pantheon Plus Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample, we reconstruct the cosmic expansion history through Gaussian process regression without assuming a specific cosmological model or relying on sound horizon calibration. Our analysis incorporates the complete covariance structure of the measurements and yields $H_0$ constraints at five distinct redshifts: $65.72 \pm 1.99$ (z=0.51), $67.78 \pm 1.75$ (z=0.706), $70.74 \pm 1.39$ (z=0.934), $71.04 \pm 1.93$ (z=1.321), and $68.37 \pm 3.95~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ (z=1.484). The optimal combination of these measurements gives $\hat{H}_0 = 69.0 \pm 1.0~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ with 1.4\% precision, which occupies an intermediate position between the Planck CMB result and the SH0ES local measurement and is consistent with the TRGB result. Rather than providing a single integrated $H_0$ value, our approach delivers independent constraints at multiple redshifts, thereby enabling a detailed investigation of potential redshift-dependent systematic effects that could contribute to the Hubble tension. We identify significant correlations between adjacent redshift bins ($\rho = -0.033$ to $0.26$), primarily arising from the BAO covariance and reconstruction effects. These results demonstrate a clear redshift evolution in Hubble constant measurements and suggest that the Hubble tension may involve more complex redshift-dependent effects than a simple dichotomy between early and late universe probes.</p>

<p>The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is largely limited by the vastness of the signaling parameter space. The concurrent signaling scheme offers a framework in which civilizations can coordinate their transmission and reception by referring to a common astrophysical event. Building on this idea, I propose a hybrid strategy that combines the Galactic Center as a spatial reference with an extragalactic burst as a temporal marker. If such a scheme is indeed employed, the sky area to be surveyed in SETI could be reduced by more than two orders of magnitude, based solely on existing astronomical data. I examine records of three types of extragalactic bursts (supernovae, neutron star mergers, and gamma-ray bursts [GRBs]) to identify suitable temporal markers. Among them, GRB 221009A is particularly notable due to its high fluence and favorable sky location.</p>

<p>SN 1993J is the best-studied radio supernova, with observations using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) spanning from within weeks of explosion through nearly three decades of ejecta evolution. Imaging and modeling techniques have revealed an expanding shell-like ejecta structure, with a width well-constrained after ~1000 days. In this work, we present a re-analysis of the first ~1700 days of SN 1993J evolution, using a new VLBI analysis technique with somewhat intrinsically higher angular resolution and compare our results with those from previous conventional techniques. We adopt the m-ring model, with potentially somewhat higher angular resolution, but only as a phenomenological alternative to the physically-motivated spherical shell model used in past analyses and shape the profile to approximately match that of the shell. We use closure quantities only, providing calibration insensitive constraints on ejecta geometry and largely independent comparisons with previous results from the same data sets. Using this approach we find the ejecta expanding with a power-law exponent $\omega=0.80\pm0.01$ averaged for the time from 175 to 1693 days, consistent with shell-fitting analyses. For the first time, we report estimates of the ejecta width at t &lt; 1000 days – as early as 264 days post-explosion – finding a mean fractional width with standard deviation of $0.24 \pm 0.04$ (of the radius) with no significant evolution. We present a fit of the azimuthal brightness modulation over time with the maximum of a horseshoe pattern rotating from east to south-southwest from 175 to 1000 d and then evolving to a more complex behavior, quantifying previous results from images only. The constraints on the angular brightness modulation and width over time and ~700 days earlier than existing analyses provide an avenue to test more advanced simulations of the explosion and interaction mechanisms.</p>

<p>Galactic PeVatrons are astrophysical sources accelerating particles up to a few PeV (~10$^{15}$ eV). The primary method to identify both electron and proton PeVatrons is the observation of $\gamma$-ray radiation at ultra-high energies (UHE; E$&gt;$100 TeV). In 2021, LHAASO detected 14 steady $\gamma$-ray sources with photon energies above 100 TeV and up to 1.4 PeV. Most of these sources can be plausibly associated with objects such as supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, and stellar clusters. However, LHAASO J0341$+$5258 is detected as an unidentified PeVatron, emitting $\gamma$ rays at energies above hundreds of TeV. It is extended in nature and notably bright, with a flux $&gt;$ 20% of the Crab Nebula’s flux above 25 TeV. Multiwavelength observations are required to identify the PeVatron responsible for the UHE $\gamma$ rays, understand the source morphology and association, and shed light on the emission processes. Here, we will present the results from the VERITAS and HAWC observations of this PeVatron, along with a discussion on potential emission scenarios through multiwavelength modeling.</p>

<p>Most visual programming languages (VPLs) are domain-specific, with few general-purpose VPLs like Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT). These general-purpose VPLs are developed using textual programming languages and improving them requires textual programming. In this thesis, we designed and developed PWCT2, a dual-language (Arabic/English), general-purpose, self-hosting visual programming language. Before doing so, we specifically designed a textual programming language called Ring for its development. Ring is a dynamically typed language with a lightweight implementation, offering syntax customization features. It permits the creation of domain-specific languages through new features that extend object-oriented programming, allowing for specialized languages resembling Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) or Supernova language. The Ring Compiler and Virtual Machine are designed using the PWCT visual programming language where the visual implementation is composed of 18,945 components that generate 24,743 lines of C code, which increases the abstraction level and hides unnecessary details. Using PWCT to develop Ring allowed us to realize several issues in PWCT, which led to the development of the PWCT2 visual programming language using the Ring textual programming language. PWCT2 provides approximately 36 times faster code generation and requires 20 times less storage for visual source files. It also allows for the conversion of Ring code into visual code, enabling the creation of a self-hosting VPL that can be developed using itself. PWCT2 consists of approximately 92,000 lines of Ring code and comes with 394 visual components.

<p>We report the discovery of 164 compact (radius &lt; 1 arcmin) radio rings using MeerKAT 1.3 GHz data from the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (l=2-60deg, 252-358deg, |b|&lt;1.5deg) and the Galactic Centre mosaic, from a search aimed at identifying previously uncatalogued radio sources. Within this sample, approximately 19 per cent of the rings contain a central point radio source. A multiwavelength analysis reveals a striking diversity: about 40 per cent of the rings enclose an isolated infrared point source, 50 per cent exhibit an extended counterpart in the mid- or far-infrared, and several are only detected in the radio band. We found that 17 per cent of the rings in the sample are positionally coincident (within 5 arcsec) with known entries in SIMBAD, including unclassified infrared sources, spiral galaxies, young stellar objects and long-period variable candidates. Based on these matches and exploiting ancillary multiwavelength data and catalogues, we explore several formation scenarios for the rings, such as HII regions, planetary nebulae, mass-loss relics from evolved massive stars, supernova remnants, nova shells, galaxies, galaxy cluster lenses and odd radio circles. Tentative classifications are proposed for nearly 60 per cent of the sample. These results highlight the potential of MeerKAT to uncover previously undetected compact radio structures and, particularly, recover missing Galactic radio-emitting objects.</p>

<p>2025-09-24, <strong>$S_8$ from Tully-Fisher, fundamental plane, and supernova distances agree with Planck</strong>, Richard Stiskalek et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20235v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20235v1</a></p>

<p>Peculiar velocity measurements constrain the parameter combination $f\sigma_8$, the product of the linear growth rate $f$ and the fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8$. Under the approximation that $f$ is a monotonic function of $\Omega_{\rm m}$, this can be related to $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$, enabling direct comparison with weak lensing and cosmic microwave background results. We exploit this by using three classes of direct-distance tracers – the Tully-Fisher relation, the fundamental plane, and Type~Ia supernovae – to infer peculiar velocities. A unified hierarchical forward model jointly calibrates each distance indicator and a linear theory reconstruction of the local Universe. This is the first consistent Bayesian analysis to combine all three major classes of distance indicators within a common framework, enabling cross-checks of systematics across diverse galaxy populations. All three tracers yield consistent values of $S_8$ that are also in agreement with Planck. Our joint constraint is $S_8 = 0.819 \pm 0.030$, with the uncertainty dominated by the 2M++ galaxy field. These results demonstrate that peculiar velocity surveys provide a robust, consistent measurement of $S_8$, and support concordance with the cosmic microwave background.</p>

<p>While Supernova Remnants (SNRs) are widely considered the primary accelerators of cosmic rays (CRs) up to hundreds of TeV, they struggle to account for the CR flux at PeV energies, suggesting the existence of additional PeVatrons. Observations from LHAASO (Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory) have identified several PeVatron candidates, including some SNRs, pulsar wind nebulae, TeV halos and young massive star clusters (YMSCs). These objects accelerate particles that interact with the surrounding interstellar medium and radiation fields, producing very-high-energy gamma rays (&gt;100 TeV), a key signature of both leptonic and hadronic PeVatrons. We simulate and model the emission of TeV halos and YMSCs, adopting radial emission profiles derived from observational data. Given the current angular resolution of gamma-ray instruments, these profiles often appear similar, making it challenging to distinguish between source classes. We explore how next-generation Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), namely the CTAO (Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory) and the ASTRI Mini-Array (Astrofisica con Specchi a Tecnologia Replicante Italiana), can classify these sources based on their morphology. We test our classification methods, derived from the profile features of known sources, on simulated CTAO and ASTRI Mini-Array observations of unidentified extended sources from the first LHAASO catalog. We present the results of our analysis to highlight the potential of future IACT observations in identifying the nature of extended gamma-ray sources, refining PeVatron candidate classifications, and improving our understanding of cosmic-ray accelerators.</p>

<p>2025-09-24, <strong>A Search for High-Energy Emission from the Remnant of Supernova 1181</strong>, J. Holder et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20131v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20131v1</a></p>

<p>Over the previous millennium, only five Galactic supernovae were observed and recorded by contemporary astronomers, and their current-day counterparts subsequently identified. The remnants of four of these have all been very deeply studied, and ultimately detected, by TeV instruments after exposures of typically hundreds of hours. The measured TeV fluxes range from 1 Crab (by definition) down to 0.3% Crab. The location of the fifth supernova remnant tied to a historical record of its supernova (SN 1181) has never been studied at TeV energies. The reason for this is simple - the associated remnant was only identified as such in 2021. The remnant, Pa 30, is an unusual object whose properties are best explained as resulting from a Type Iax supernova explosion. These are a rare sub-type of Type Ia supernovae in which the merging white dwarfs are not fully destroyed by the supernova explosion, leading to a double-degenerate merger product colorfully described as a ‘zombie star’. We will present the results of a search for TeV gamma-ray emission from Pa 30 with VERITAS.</p>

<p>2025-09-24, <strong>Supergiant GCIRS 22 in the Milky Way Nuclear Star Cluster: Revised alpha abundances</strong>, B. Thorsbro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20075v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.20075v1</a></p>

<p>Context: The chemical abundances of alpha-elements in Galactic Centre (GC) supergiants provide key insights into the chemical enrichment and star formation history of the Milky Way’s Nuclear Star Cluster. Previous studies have reported enhanced alpha-element abundances, raising questions about the chemical evolution of this unique region.   Aims: We aim to reassess the alpha-element abundances in the GC supergiant GCIRS 22 using updated spectral modelling and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) corrections to resolve discrepancies from earlier abundance analyses.   Methods: High-resolution near-infrared spectra of GCIRS 22 were analysed using contemporary line lists and precise stellar parameters derived from scandium line diagnostics. We applied comprehensive NLTE corrections to accurately determine the abundances of silicon and calcium.   Results: Our analysis reveals solar-scale alpha abundances ([Ca/Fe] = 0.06 $\pm$ 0.07; [Si/Fe] = $-$0.08 $\pm$ 0.20) for GCIRS 22, significantly lower than previous LTE-based findings. NLTE corrections reduce the calcium abundance by approximately 0.3,dex compared to LTE estimates, aligning our results with recent studies and highlighting the importance of accurate NLTE modelling.   Conclusions: The solar-scale alpha-element abundances observed in GCIRS 22 suggest that recent star formation in the region has not been dominated by Type II supernovae, such as those expected from a recent starburst. Our findings support a scenario of episodic star formation, characterized by intermittent bursts separated by extended quiescent phases, or potentially driven by gas inflows from the inner disk, funnelled by the Galactic bar. Future comprehensive NLTE studies of additional GC stars will be essential for refining our understanding of the region’s chemical evolution and star formation history.</p>

<p>2025-09-24, <strong>Analytical modeling of polarization signals arising from confined circumstellar material in Type II supernovae</strong>, T. Nagao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19874v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.19874v1</a></p>

<p>Recent observations of Type II supernovae (SNe) have brought a challenge in our understanding on the final evolutionary stage of massive stars. The early-time spectra and light curves of Type II SNe suggest that a majority of them have dense circumstellar material (CSM) in their vicinity, the so-called confined CSM. However, the mechanism of these extensive mass loss has not yet been understood. For addressing this problem, we aim to study the spatial distribution of the confined CSM, which has important information on the mechanism. We analytically calculate the polarization signals created by electron scatterings within disk-like confined CSM, and apply the results to the case of SN 2023ixf. The calculated polarization angle remains fixed at the angle aligned with the CSM disk axis, and is insensitive to the disk parameters. The calculated polarization degree evolves over a timescale of &lt; 10 days, depending on the disk parameters: it stays constant or increases slightly while the unshocked CSM is optically thick, peaks as it becomes optically thin, and drops to zero when the shock reaches the disk’s outer edge. We also find that the time evolution of the polarization in Type II SNe with confined CSM can be used for estimating the CSM parameters. In particular, the maximum degree and the rise time are strongly connected to the values of the viewing angle and the opening angle of the CSM disk, while the duration and the decline time are sensitive to the values of the mass and extension of the CSM disk. We demonstrate that the time evolution of the polarization of SN 2023ixf can be explained with a disk-like CSM. This information of the CSM is a strong constraint on the mechanism to create the confined CSM.</p>

<p>2025-09-24, <strong>Effects of multidimensional treatment of gravity in simulations on supernova gravitational waves</strong>, Hajime Sotani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19724v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2509.19724v1</a></p>

<p>Supernova explosions are expected as one of the promising candidates for gravitational wave sources. In this study, we examine the supernova gravitational waves, focusing on the multidimensional treatment of gravity in the simulation. For this purpose, we newly performed two-dimensional relativistic simulations with a nonmonopole (two-dimensional) potential and compared the resultant gravitational wave signals in the simulations with the frequencies of the proto-neutron stars with and without the Cowling approximation. Then, we find that the proto-neutron star frequencies with the Cowling approximation overestimate the gravitational wave frequencies. On the other hand, the frequencies of the proto-neutron star oscillations with metric perturbations agree well with the gravitational wave signals in the simulations. Employing the new data, we derive a new fitting formula for the supernova gravitational wave frequencies with the two-dimensional gravitational potential, independently of the progenitor mass. Combining this new formula with the previous one derived from the Cowling approximation, we also derive the formula to predict the gravitational wave frequencies with a two-dimensional potential, using those with a monopole potential.</p>
