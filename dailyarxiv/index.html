<p>2024-04-29, <strong>Torsion-induced axions in string theory, quantum gravity and the cosmological tensions</strong>, Nick E. Mavromatos et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18741v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18741v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the role of torsion in string theory on inducing pseudoscalar degrees of freedom (axions), which in turn couple to (gravitational) Chern-Simons (CS) anomalous terms. Such interactions can induce inflation, of running vacuum type, not requiring external inflaton fields, through condensation of the anomalous terms as a consequence of primordial chiral gravitational-wave (GW) tensor perturbations in a weak-quantum gravity setting. The presence of an UV cutoff for the GW quantum graviton modes opens up the system, leading to a dissipative behaviour realised via the presence of non trivial imaginary parts of the gravitational CS terms. The naive estimate of the life time of inflation based on such imaginary parts, which afflict the pertinent GW Hamiltonian, is quite consistent with the estimates of the duration of inflation based on an analysis of the condensate-induced linear-axion-potential by means of dynamical systems. Such quantum-gravity effects can also contribute positively to the alleviation of cosmological tensions if they survive today. In the talk we discuss the conditions under which such a result may be achieved. We also discuss the potential role of other axions in string theory, coming from compactification, in inducing enhanced densities of primordial black holes during RVM inflation, thereby contributing to significantly increased percentages of these black holes that can play the role of dark matter components. Moreover, under certain circumstances, that we shall discuss in some detail, it is also possible that the initially massless torsion-induced axions can acquire a non-trivial mass during the radiation era, thereby providing additional dark matter components in the Universe. With regards to this aspect, we also emphasise the role of massive right-handed neutrinos, provided that such excitations exist in the relevant spectra.</p>

<p>2024-04-29, <strong>Dynamical ejecta from binary neutron star mergers: Impact of residual eccentricity and equation of state implementation</strong>, Francois Foucart et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18674v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18674v1</a></p>

<p>Predicting the properties of the matter ejected during and after a neutron star merger is crucial to our ability to use electromagnetic observations of these mergers to constrain the masses of the neutron stars, the equation of state of dense matter, and the role of neutron star mergers in the enrichment of the Universe in heavy elements. Our ability to reliably provide such predictions is however limited by a broad range of factors, including the finite resolution of numerical simulations, their treatment of magnetic fields, neutrinos, and neutrino-matter interactions, and the approximate modeling of the equation of state of dense matter. In this manuscript, we study specifically the role that a small residual eccentricity and different implementations of the same equation of state have on the matter ejected during the merger of a $1.3M_\odot-1.4M_\odot$ binary neutron star system. We find that a residual eccentricity $e\sim 0.01$, as measured $\sim 4-6$ orbits before merger, causes $O(25\%-30\%)$ changes in the amount of ejected mass, mainly due to changes in the amount of matter ejected as a result of core bounces during merger. We note that $O(1\%)$ residual eccentricities have regularly been used in binary neutron star merger simulations as proxy for circular binaries, potentially creating an additional source of error in predictions for the mass of the dynamical ejecta.</p>

<p>2024-04-28, <strong>Electrophilic scalar hair from rotating magnetized stars and effects of cosmic neutrino background</strong>, Gaetano Lambiase et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18309v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18309v1</a></p>

<p>Ultralight electrophilic scalar field can mediate a long-range force or radiate from a pulsar or a magnetar if the scalar field has a coupling with the Goldreich-Julian charge density or the net electron charge density of the star. The interaction of the electron with the long-range scalar profile results in a spatial variation of the electron mass. A scalar induced magnetic field is created due to such interaction. The mass of the scalar in such cases is constrained by the radius of the star. The scalar field can also radiate from a binary system or an isolated star if the mass of the scalar is less than the orbital frequency and the spin frequency respectively. The electrophilic scalar radiation can contribute to the orbital period loss of binary systems and pulsar spin-down. Comparing with existing and projected experimental sensitivities, we obtain constraints on scalar coupling with ultralight mass. Some of these bounds are stronger than the existing fifth force constraints. The constraints on the scalar coupling can be significantly screened if the scalar has a coupling with the ubiquitous cosmic neutrino background. Improvements in experimental sensitivity and observations of compact objects with stronger magnetic fields and higher angular velocities could further refine these bounds.</p>

<p>2024-04-28, <strong>Observing Supernova Neutrino Light Curves with Super-Kamiokande. V. Distance Estimation with Neutrinos Alone</strong>, Yudai Suwa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18248v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18248v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinos are pivotal signals in multi-messenger observations of supernovae. Recent advancements in the analysis method of supernova neutrinos, especially in quantitative analysis, have significantly broadened scientific possibilities. This study demonstrates the feasibility of estimating distances to supernovae using quantitative analysis techniques for supernova neutrinos. This estimation utilizes the direct relationship between the radius of a neutron star and the distance to the supernova. The radius of a neutron star is determined with an approximate uncertainty of 10% through observations such as X-rays and gravitational waves. By integrating this information, the distance to the supernova can be estimated with an uncertainty of within 15% at a 95% confidence level. It has been established that neutrinos can pinpoint the direction of supernovae, and when combined with distance estimates, three-dimensional localization becomes achievable. This capability is vital for follow-up observations using multi-messenger approaches. Moreover, more precise distance determinations to supernovae through follow-up observations, such as optical observations, allow for accurate measurements of neutron star radii. This data, via the neutron star mass-radius relationship, could provide various insights into nuclear physics.</p>

<p>2024-04-29, <strong>Phantom matter: a challenging solution to the cosmological tensions</strong>, Adria Gomez-Valent et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18845v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18845v1</a></p>

<p>The idea of composite dark energy (DE) is quite natural since on general grounds we expect that the vacuum energy (associated to the cosmological term $\Lambda$) may appear in combination with other effective forms of DE, collectively denoted $X$. This was indeed the old proposal from 2006, (cf. Ref.[41]) called the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$\Lambda$XCDM model', which was primordially designed to explain the cosmic coincidence problem. We now find that it can also have far reaching consequences on the current cosmological tensions on $H\_0$ and the growth of large scale structure (LSS). The $\Lambda$XCDM may involve both a phantom-like component $X$ and a constant cosmological term $\Lambda$ (positive or negative) or even a running one, $\Lambda=\Lambda(H)$. In the current work, we deal with a simplified version of the model and exploit the possibility that $X$ behaves as </code>phantom matter’ (PM). The latter appears in stringy versions of the running vacuum model (RVM). Unlike phantom DE, it satisfies the strong energy condition like usual matter, hence bringing to bear positive pressure at the expense of negative energy. Bubbles of PM may appear in the manner of a transitory `phantom vacuum’ tunneled into the late universe before it heads towards a new de Sitter era, thereby offering a crop field for the growing of structures earlier than expected. Using SNIa, cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that the tensions virtually disappear in this stringy RVM scenario characterized by axionic dark matter. The value of $H_0$ emerging from our analysis proves compatible with SH0ES to within less than $0.25\sigma$ and the LSS growth tension is nonexistent. The statistical information criteria point to very strong evidence in favor of the PM solution.</p>

<p>2024-04-29, <strong>Classical Casimir pressure in the presence of axion dark matter</strong>, Philippe Brax et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18710v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18710v1</a></p>

<p>We study the effects of an oscillating axion field on the pressure between two metallic plates. We consider the situation where a magnetic field parallel to the plates is present and show that the electric field induced by the coupling of the axion to photons leads to resonances. When the boundary plates are perfect conductors, the resonances are infinitely thin whilst they are broadened when the conductivity of the boundary plates is taken into account. The resonances take place at the tower of distances close to dn = (2n+1){\pi}/m where m is the axion mass and have a finite width and height depending on the conductivity. The resulting resonant pressure on the plate depends on the induced polarisation at the surface of the plates. We investigate the reach of future Casimir experiments in terms of the axion mass and the conductivity of the boundary plates. We find that for large enough conductivities, the axion-induced pressure could be larger than the quantum Casimir effect between the plates.</p>

<p>2024-04-29, <strong>Gravitational wave detection of DFSZ axion models</strong>, Aidi Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18703v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18703v1</a></p>

<p>As a promising dark matter candidate, the axion particle can naturally solve the strong CP problem of the standard model through the U(1) Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking process. However, detecting this high-energy process poses a significant challenge for colliders. We precisely calculate the phase transition gravitational wave signals of this symmetry-breaking process in the popular DFSZ axion model. By comparing the signals with the expected sensitivity of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, we demonstrate that Cosmic Explorer could detect this process with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 8 for the benchmark points. Furthermore, by performing Fisher analysis, we find that if signals are observed, the bubble wall velocity will be the first phase transition parameter to be determined. The future gravitational wave detectors are expected to provide a new approach to exploring concrete axion models.</p>

<p>2024-04-29, <strong>Exploring the evolution of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy with SPH simulations: I. Stellar feedback</strong>, Roberto Hazenfratz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18701v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18701v1</a></p>

<p>A fundamental question regarding the evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies is the identification of the key physical mechanisms responsible for gas depletion. Here, we focus on the study of stellar feedback in isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies, by performing numerical simulations using a modified version of the SPH code GADGET-3. The Milky Way satellite Leo II (PGC 34176) in the Local Group was considered as our default model dwarf galaxy. The parameter space for the stellar feedback models was explored to match observational constraints of Leo II, such as residual gas mass, total mass within the tidal radius, star formation history, final stellar mass, stellar ages and metallicity. Additionally, we examined the impact of the binary fraction of stars, initial mass function, dark matter halo mass and initial gas reservoir. Many simulations revealed recent star formation quenching due to stellar feedback. In general, the gas depletion, expected star formation history, total mass of stars and total mass within the tidal radius were adequately reproduced in the simulations when compared to observational estimates. However, there were discrepancies in the distribution of stellar ages and metallicities, which suggested that the cosmic gas infall would play a more complex role in our dwarf spheroidal galaxy than captured by a monolithic infall scenario. Our results suggest that currently quenched dwarf galaxies may not necessarily need to evolve within clusters or groups, and that stellar feedback alone could be a sufficient factor in shaping at least some of these galaxies as we observe them today.</p>

<p>2024-04-29, <strong>Absolute light yield measurement of NaI:Tl crystals for dark matter search</strong>, Nguyen Thanh Luan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18551v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18551v1</a></p>

<p>The NaI:Tl crystals were early investigated and used for wide application fields due to high light yield and crystal growth advantages. So far, the absolute light yields of NaI:Tl crystal have typically been known to be 40 ph/keV. However, it varies widely, far from the theoretical estimation. Since the high light yield and better sensitivity of NaI:Tl crystal is important for low mass dark matter search. Therefore, it is necessary to use high light NaI:Tl crystal, and absolute light yield should be measured with accuracy. In this work, we use the single photoelectron technique for measuring the absolute light yield of 35 NaI:Tl crystals with various sizes from different vendors. There are several high-quality crystals from the COSINE-100 experiment and commercial companies in these crystals. The theoretical estimation and GEANT4 optical simulation have been studied to investigate the PMT optics. Results show the essential role of this correction in avoiding overrated light yield values. The SPE technique using different PMT was compared to the photodiode and avalanche photodiode methods. A 10% systematic error was obtained. Our results show the excellent absolute light yield of NaI:Tl, at 59.4 +- 5.9 ph/keV, while the theoretical predicted light yield is around 70 ph/keV. The evaluation with NaI:Tl crystals in the COSINE-100 experiment has been performed. The six crystals in the COSINE-100 experiment have a high light yield. Based on our results, the light loss of encapsulation needs to be improved, especially for the big-size crystals.</p>

<p>2024-04-29, <strong>A new hybrid gadolinium nanoparticles-loaded polymeric material for neutron detection in rare event searches</strong>, DarkSide-20k Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18492v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18492v1</a></p>

<p>Experiments aimed at direct searches for WIMP dark matter require highly effective reduction of backgrounds and control of any residual radioactive contamination. In particular, neutrons interacting with atomic nuclei represent an important class of backgrounds due to the expected similarity of a WIMP-nucleon interaction, so that such experiments often feature a dedicated neutron detector surrounding the active target volume. In the context of the development of DarkSide-20k detector at INFN Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS), several R&amp;D projects were conceived and developed for the creation of a new hybrid material rich in both hydrogen and gadolinium nuclei to be employed as an essential element of the neutron detector. Thanks to its very high cross-section for neutron capture, gadolinium is one of the most widely used elements in neutron detectors, while the hydrogen-rich material is instrumental in efficiently moderating the neutrons. In this paper results from one of the R&amp;Ds are presented. In this effort the new hybrid material was obtained as a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix, loaded with gadolinium oxide in the form of nanoparticles. We describe its realization, including all phases of design, purification, construction, characterization, and determination of mechanical properties of the new material.</p>

<p>2024-04-29, <strong>Parameter optimization of Josephson parametric amplifiers using a heuristic search algorithm for axion haloscope search</strong>, Younggeun Kim et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18345v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18345v1</a></p>

<p>The cavity haloscope is among the most widely adopted experimental platforms designed to detect dark matter axions with its principle relying on the conversion of axions into microwave photons in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA), known for its quantum-limited noise characteristics, has been incorporated in the detection system to capture the weakly interacting axion signals. However, the performance of the JPA can be influenced by its environment, leading to potential unreliability of a predefined parameter set obtained in a specific laboratory setting. Furthermore, conducting a broadband search requires consecutive characterization of the amplifier across different tuning frequencies. To ensure more reliable measurements, we utilize the Nelder-Mead technique as a numerical search method to dynamically determine the optimal operating conditions. This heuristic search algorithm explores the multidimensional parameter space of the JPA, optimizing critical characteristics such as gain and noise temperature to maximize signal-to-noise ratios for a given experimental setup. Our study presents a comprehensive analysis of the properties of a flux-driven JPA to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. This approach contributes to ongoing efforts in axion dark matter research by offering an efficient method to enhance axion detection sensitivity through the optimized utilization of JPAs.</p>

<p>2024-04-28, <strong>Quantum-enhanced learning with a controllable bosonic variational sensor network</strong>, Pengcheng Liao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18293v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18293v1</a></p>

<p>The emergence of quantum sensor networks has presented opportunities for enhancing complex sensing tasks, while simultaneously introducing significant challenges in designing and analyzing quantum sensing protocols due to the intricate nature of entanglement and physical processes. Supervised learning assisted by an entangled sensor network (SLAEN) [Phys. Rev. X 9, 041023 (2019)] represents a promising paradigm for automating sensor-network design through variational quantum machine learning. However, the original SLAEN, constrained by the Gaussian nature of quantum circuits, is limited to learning linearly separable data. Leveraging the universal quantum control available in cavity-QED experiments, we propose a generalized SLAEN capable of handling nonlinear data classification tasks. We establish a theoretical framework for physical-layer data classification to underpin our approach. Through training quantum probes and measurements, we uncover a threshold phenomenon in classification error across various tasks – when the energy of probes exceeds a certain threshold, the error drastically diminishes to zero, providing a significant improvement over the Gaussian SLAEN. Despite the non-Gaussian nature of the problem, we offer analytical insights into determining the threshold and residual error in the presence of noise. Our findings carry implications for radio-frequency photonic sensors and microwave dark matter haloscopes.</p>

<p>2024-04-28, <strong>Wide Binary Evaporation by Dark Solitons: Implications from the GAIA Catalog</strong>, Qiming Qiu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18099v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18099v1</a></p>

<p>An analytic calculation is given for binary star evaporation under the tidal perturbation from randomly distributed, spatially extended dark objects. In particular, the Milky Way’s wide binary star population are susceptible to such disruption from dark matter solitons of comparable and larger sizes. We identify high-probability `halo-like’ wide binaries in GAIA EDR3 with separations larger than 0.1 parsec. Survival of the farthest-separated candidates will provide a novel gravitational probe to dark matter in the form of solitons. In case of dilute axion-like solitons, the observational sensitivity is shown to extend into the axion mass range $m_a \sim 10^{-17}-10^{-15}$ eV.</p>

<p>2024-04-28, <strong>Superbubbles as the source of dynamical friction: gas migration, stellar and dark matter contributions</strong>, Rain Kipper et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18086v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18086v1</a></p>

<p>The gas distribution in galaxies is smooth on large scales but is usually inhomogeneous as well as time-dependent on smaller scales. The time-dependence originates from processes such as cloud formation, their collisions and supernovae (SNe) explosions. The inhomogeneities in the matter distribution give rise to variations in the local galactic gravitational potential, which can contribute towards dynamically coupling the gas disk to the stellar and the dark matter (DM) components of the galaxy. Specifically, multiple supernovae occurring in young stellar clusters give rise to superbubbles (SB), which modify the local acceleration field and alter the energy and momentum of stars of DM particles traversing them, in broad analogy to the dynamical friction caused by a massive object. We aim to quantify how the acceleration field from SBs causes dynamical friction and contributes to the secular evolution of galaxies. In order to assess this, we construct the density modifications to the gas distribution that mimics a SB. By evaluating the acceleration field from these density modifications, we see how the momentum or angular momentum of the gas hosting the SBs changes when stars pass through the SB. Combining the effects of all the stars and SBs we, construct an empirical approximation formula for the momentum loss in homogeneous and isotropic cases. We find that the rate at which the gas disc loses its specific angular momentum via the above process is up to 4% per Gyr, which translates to under half of its original value over the lifetime of the disc. Finally, we studied how the dynamical coupling of the gas disk with the DM halo depends on assumptions on the halo kinematics (e.g. rotation) and found a ~0.3% variation in the gas disc secular evolution between different DM kinematic models.</p>

<p>2024-04-29, <strong>The population of Galactic supernova remnants in the TeV range</strong>, Rowan Batzofin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18595v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18595v1</a></p>

<p>Supernova remnants (SNRs) are likely to be significant sources of cosmic rays up to the knee of the local cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum. They produce gamma-rays in the very-high-energy (VHE) ($E&gt;0.1$ TeV) range via: hadronic interactions with the interstellar medium and leptonic interactions with soft photons. Current observations have lead to the detection of about a dozen of VHE SNRs and future instruments should increase this number. The details of particle acceleration at SNRs, and of the mechanisms producing VHE gamma-rays at SNRs are poorly understood. We aim to study the population of SNRs detected in the TeV range and its properties, and to address fundamental questions of particle acceleration at SNR shocks: What is the spectrum of accelerated particles? What is the efficiency of acceleration? Is the VHE emission dominated by hadronic or leptonic interactions? By means of Monte Carlo methods, we simulate the population of SNRs in the VHE domain and confront our simulations to H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey (HGPS). We explore the parameter space: the slope of accelerated particles $\alpha$, the electron-to-proton ratio $K_{\rm ep}$, and the efficiency of particle acceleration $\xi $. We found sets of parameters for which $\gtrsim 90$\% of realisations are found in agreements with the HGPS data. These parameters are found $ 4.2 \gtrsim \alpha \gtrsim 4.1 $, $10^{-5} \lesssim K_{\rm ep} \lesssim 10^{-4.5}$, and $0.03 \lesssim \xi\lesssim 0.1 $ . We were able to strongly argue against some regions of the parameter space: $\alpha \lesssim 4.05$, $\alpha \gtrsim 4.35$, or $K_{\rm ep} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$. Our model is so far able to explain the SNR population of the HGPS. Our approach, confronted to the results of future systematic surveys, will help remove degeneracy in the solutions, and to better understand particle acceleration at SNR shocks.</p>

<p>2024-04-29, <strong>Constraints on Tsallis cosmology using recent low redshift measurements</strong>, M. L. Mendoza-Martínez et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18346v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18346v1</a></p>

<p>Recently Tsallis cosmology has been presented as a novel proposal for alleviating both $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions. Hence a universe filled with matter and radiation as perfect fluids and considering the Tsallis entropy is confronted using recent cosmological measurements coming from cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, hydrogen II galaxies, quasars, and baryon acoustic oscillations. Following a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis and combining the samples, we constrain the main characteristic parameters $\alpha = 1.031^{+0.054}_{-0.051}$ and $\delta = 1.005^{+0.001}_{-0.001}$ where the uncertainties are $1\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, we estimate the today deceleration parameter $q_0=-0.530^{+0.018}_{-0.017}$, the deceleration-acceleration transition redshift $z_T=0.632^{+0.028}_{-0.028}$ and the age of the universe $\tau_U = 12.637^{+0.067}_{-0.066}\,\rm{Gyrs}$ which are in agreement with the standard cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM) within $1.5\sigma$. Furthermore, we find that the dark energy equation of state is consistent with both phantom and quintessence behaviors within $1\sigma$ in the past and converging to $\Lambda$CDM in the future. Finally, Tsallis cosmology is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM by the combined data, suggesting further studies at the perturbation level.</p>

<p>2024-04-28, <strong>Inhibited destruction of dust by supernova in a clumpy medium</strong>, Svyatoslav Yu. Dedikov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18317v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18317v1</a></p>

<p>The decrease rate of dust mass due to strong shock waves ($v_s\geq 150$ km s$^{-1}$) from supernovae (SNe) estimated for the Milky Way interstellar medium significantly exceeds the overall production rate by both asymptotic giant branch stars and core collapse SNe. The interplay between the production and destruction rates is critically important for evaluation of the net dust outcome from SNe at different conditions. In light of this, we study the dynamics of initially polydisperse dust grains pre-existed in an ambient medium swept up the SN shock front depending on magnitude of inhomogeneity (clumpiness) in {the} medium. We find that dust destruction inside the bubble is inhibited in more inhomogeneous medium: the larger amount of dust survives for the higher dispersion of density. This trend is set by the interrelation between radiative gas cooling and dust sputtering in different environment. After several radiative times the mass fraction of the survived dust saturates at the level almost independent on the gas mean density. We note that for more clumpy medium the distributions of dust over thermal phases of a gas inside the bubble and over sizes are smoother and flatter in comparison with those in a nearly homogeneous medium.</p>

<p>2024-04-28, <strong>ELEPHANT: ExtragaLactic alErt Pipeline for Hostless AstroNomical Transients</strong>, P. J. Pessi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18165v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18165v1</a></p>

<p>Context. Transient astronomical events that exhibit no discernible association with a host galaxy are commonly referred to as hostless. These rare phenomena are associated with extremely energetic events, and they can offer unique insights into the properties and evolution of stars and galaxies. However, the sheer number of transients captured by contemporary high-cadence astronomical surveys renders the manual identification of all potential hostless transients impractical. Therefore, creating a systematic identification tool is crucial for studying these elusive events. Aims. We present the ExtragaLactic alErt Pipeline for Hostless AstroNomical Transients (ELEPHANT), a framework for filtering hostless transients in astronomical data streams. Methods. We used Fink to access all the ZTF alerts produced between January/2022 and December/2023, selecting only those associated with extragalactic transients. We then processed the associated stamps using a sequence of image analysis techniques to retrieve hostless candidates. Results. We find that less than 2% of all analyzed transients are potentially hostless. Among them, approximately 10% have a spectroscopic class reported on TNS, with Type Ia supernova being the most common class, followed by SLSN. Among the hostless candidates retrieved by our pipeline, there was SN 2018ibb, which has been proposed to be a PISN candidate; and SN 2022ann, one of only five known SNe Icn. When no class is reported on TNS, the dominant classes are QSO and SN candidates, the former obtained from SIMBAD and the latter inferred using the Fink ML classifier. Conclusions. ELEPHANT represents an effective strategy to filter extragalactic events within large and complex astronomical alert streams. There are many applications for which this pipeline will be useful, ranging from transient selection for follow-up to studies of transient environments.</p>

<p>2024-04-28, <strong>The Cosmological Impact of Brane-Chern-Simons Massive Gravity</strong>, Sobhan Kazempour et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18147v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18147v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we present a novel extension of massive gravity theory; the Brane-Chern-Simons massive gravity theory. We explore the cosmological implications of this theory by deriving the background equations and demonstrating the existence of self-accelerating solutions. Interestingly, our theory suggests the existence of self-accelerating mechanisms that originate from an effective cosmological constant, leading to intriguing possibilities for understanding the nature of cosmic acceleration. Furthermore, we perform a tensor perturbation analysis to investigate the propagation of gravitational waves in this framework. We derive the dispersion relation for gravitational waves and study their behavior in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Roberson-Waker cosmology within the context of Brane-Chen-Simons massive gravity. Utilizing the latest Union2 type Ia supernova dataset comprising $557$ SNIa events, we provide observational support for our theoretical framework, indicating that the Brane-Chern-Simons massive gravity theory is consistent with cosmological observations.</p>

<p>2024-04-28, <strong>Superbubbles as the source of dynamical friction: gas migration, stellar and dark matter contributions</strong>, Rain Kipper et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18086v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18086v1</a></p>

<p>The gas distribution in galaxies is smooth on large scales but is usually inhomogeneous as well as time-dependent on smaller scales. The time-dependence originates from processes such as cloud formation, their collisions and supernovae (SNe) explosions. The inhomogeneities in the matter distribution give rise to variations in the local galactic gravitational potential, which can contribute towards dynamically coupling the gas disk to the stellar and the dark matter (DM) components of the galaxy. Specifically, multiple supernovae occurring in young stellar clusters give rise to superbubbles (SB), which modify the local acceleration field and alter the energy and momentum of stars of DM particles traversing them, in broad analogy to the dynamical friction caused by a massive object. We aim to quantify how the acceleration field from SBs causes dynamical friction and contributes to the secular evolution of galaxies. In order to assess this, we construct the density modifications to the gas distribution that mimics a SB. By evaluating the acceleration field from these density modifications, we see how the momentum or angular momentum of the gas hosting the SBs changes when stars pass through the SB. Combining the effects of all the stars and SBs we, construct an empirical approximation formula for the momentum loss in homogeneous and isotropic cases. We find that the rate at which the gas disc loses its specific angular momentum via the above process is up to 4% per Gyr, which translates to under half of its original value over the lifetime of the disc. Finally, we studied how the dynamical coupling of the gas disk with the DM halo depends on assumptions on the halo kinematics (e.g. rotation) and found a ~0.3% variation in the gas disc secular evolution between different DM kinematic models.</p>

<p>2024-04-28, <strong>Gravitational wave radiation from magnetar-driven supernovae</strong>, Lang Xie et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18076v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2404.18076v1</a></p>

<p>Rapidly spinning magnetars are potential candidates for the energy source of supernovae (SNe) and gamma-ray bursts and the most promising sources for continuous gravitational waves (GWs) detected by ground-based GW detectors. Continuous GWs can be radiated from magnetars due to magnetic-induced deformation or fluid oscillations, compatible with magnetic dipole (MD) radiation for spin-down energy. In this paper, we investigate the diverse light curves of magnetar-driven SNe in the scenario that the spin-down is dominated by GW radiation and/or MD radiation. By simulating the light curves of SNe and employing the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, we constrain the parameters of the magnetars and SN explosions and show that the signature of GW radiation may be indicated by the bolometric luminosity curves of SNe Ic-BL 2007ru and 2009bb. We find that the ellipticity of magnetars in the order of $10^{-3}$ can be induced by the magnetic field of $\sim 10^{16} \mbox{ G}$. If such continuous GWs associated with SNe can be detected in the future by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, this would be a smoking gun for a magnetar engine powering SNe.</p>
