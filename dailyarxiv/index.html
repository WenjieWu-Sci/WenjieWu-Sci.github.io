<p>2025-04-08, <strong>Impact of MvdW Equation of State and Neutrino Mass on r and s Process Heavy Element Nucleosynthesis in Spiral, Elliptical and Dwarf Galactic Environments and Kilonovae Events</strong>, Keith Andrew et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06191v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.06191v1</a></p>

<p>We present an analysis of heavy element production with massive neutrinos in galaxies of varying types (spiral, elliptical, and dwarf) and kilonovae events by incorporating a Multicomponent van der Waals (MvdW) equation of state (EoS) for the opacity functions. This EoS is applied to derive opacities and calculate the yields of isotopes formed in r-process and s-process nucleosynthesis, with and without the influence of neutrino masses or oscillations. We look at both the lanthanide and actinide sequences using the MvdW parameters that involve the interaction strength and excluded volume effects. Our results reflect the characteristic differences found in r and s processes in the synthesis and long-term evolution of isotopes from the U, Th, and Sr chain across galactic environments. The inclusion of neutrino masses enhances the neutron-to-proton ratio, favoring heavier r-process isotopes and altering the overall galactic yields by cross section suppression. These findings offer insights into the interplay of nuclear physics and astrophysical environments, highlighting the sensitivity of nucleosynthetic pathways to EoS modifications and neutrino physics. We compare these results to metallicity profiles of similar models: the Galactic Leaky Box, the Galactic Inflow, and the Galactic Closed Box models and to the kilonova event GW170781.</p>

<p>2025-04-08, <strong>Impact of newly measured $β$\nobreakdash-delayed neutron emitters around \myisoSimp{78}{Ni} on light element nucleosynthesis in the neutrino-wind following a neutron star merger</strong>, A. Tolosa-Delgado et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06008v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.06008v1</a></p>

<p>Neutron emission probabilities and half-lives of 37 beta-delayed neutron emitters from 75Ni to 92Br were measured at the RIKEN Nishina Center in Japan, including 11 one-neutron and 13 two-neutron emission probabilities and 6 half-lives measured for the first time, which supersede theoretical estimates. These nuclei lie in the path of the weak r-process occurring in neutrino-driven winds from the accretion disk formed after the merger of two neutron stars, synthesizing elements in the A~80 abundance peak. The presence of such elements dominates the accompanying kilonova emission over the first few days and has been identified in the AT2017gfo event, associated with the gravitational wave detection GW170817.   Abundance calculations based on over 17000 simulated trajectories describing the evolution of matter properties in the merger outflows show that the new data lead to an increase of 50-70 percent in the abundance of Y, Zr, Nb, and Mo. This enhancement is large compared to the scatter of relative abundances observed in old very metal-poor stars and is therefore significant in the comparison with other possible astrophysical processes contributing to light-element production.   These results underline the importance of including experimental decay data for very neutron-rich beta-delayed neutron emitters into r-process models.</p>

<p>2025-04-08, <strong>Generalised Symmetries in Particle Physics</strong>, Joe Davighi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05960v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.05960v1</a></p>

<p>In this talk I review various notions of generalised global symmetry: higher-form, higher-group, and non-invertible symmetry. All these notions have had profound impact on quantum field theory research in the last decade. I highlight various applications of these new symmetries in particle physics, focussing on theories beyond the Standard Model. Areas touched upon include axions, gauge unification, dark matter, neutrino masses, and flavour hierarchies.</p>

<p>2025-04-08, <strong>The Impact of Neutrino Magnetic Moments on the Evolution of the Helium Flash and Lithium-Rich Red Clump Stars</strong>, Xizhen Lu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05671v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.05671v2</a></p>

<p>The detection of the neutrino magnetic moment (NMM,$\mu_v$) is one of the most significant challenges in physics. The additional energy loss due to NMM can significantly influence the He flash evolution in low-mass stars. Using the MESA code, we investigated the impact of NMM on the He flash evolution in low-mass stars. We found that NMM leads to an increase in both the critical He core mass required for the He flash and the luminosity of TRGB. For a typical $Z = 1 Z_{\odot}$ , $M$ = 1.0 $M_{\odot}$, and $\mu_v = 3 \times 10^{-12} \mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ model, the He core mass increases by $\sim 5\%$, and the TRGB luminosity increases by $\sim 35\%$ compared to the model without NMM. However, contrary to previous conclusions, our model indicates that the He flash occurs earlier, rather than delayed, with increasing NMM values. This is because the additional energy loss from NMM accelerates the contraction of the He core, releases more gravitational energy that heats the H shell and increases the hydrogen burning rate, thereby causing the He core to reach the critical mass faster and advancing the He flash. An increase in NMM results in a higher peak luminosity for the first He flash, a more off-center ignition position, and sub-flashes with higher luminosities, shorter intervals, and higher frequency. We found that the internal gravity wave (IGW) mixing generated by the He flash can induce sufficient mixing in the radiative zone, turning the overshoot region into a low-Dmix bottleneck within the stellar interior. The increase in NMM in the model narrows the overshoot bottleneck region, enabling Li to enter the surface convection zone more quickly, thereby enhancing the enrichment effect of IGW mixing on surface Li. For models incorporating both NMM and IGW mixing, the reduction in the overshoot bottleneck region allows them to effectively produce super Li-rich red clump star samples.</p>

<p>2025-04-08, <strong>NQG III – Two-Centre Problems, Whirlpool Galaxy and Toy Neutron Stars</strong>, Richard Durran et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06030v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.06030v1</a></p>

<p>In the hunt for WIMPish dark matter and testing our new theory, we extend the results obtained for the Kepler problem in NQG I and NQG II to the Euler two-centre problem and to other classical Hamiltonian systems with planar periodic orbits. In the first case our results lead to quantum elliptical spirals converging to elliptical orbits where stars and other celestial bodies can form as the corresponding WIMP/molecular clouds condense. The examples inevitably involve elliptic integrals as was the case in our earlier work on equatorial orbits of toy neutron stars (see Ref. [27]). Hence this is the example on which we focus in this work on quantisation. The main part of our analysis which leans heavily on Hamilton-Jacobi theory is applicable to any KLMN integrable planar periodic orbits for Hamiltonian systems. The most useful results on Weierstrass elliptic functions needed in these two works we have summarised with complete proofs in the appendix. This has been one of the most enjoyable parts of this research understanding in more detail the genius of Weierstrass and Jacobi. However we have to say that the beautiful simplicity of the Euler two-centre results herein transcend even this as far as we are concerned. At the end of the paper we see how the Burgers-Zeldovich fluid model relates to our set-up through Nelson’s stochastic mechanics.</p>

<p>2025-04-08, <strong>Scalar-assisted magnetogenesis during the radiation-dominated epoch</strong>, Alexandar Ganz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05835v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.05835v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a novel mechanism to generate primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) strong enough to explain the observed cosmic magnetic fields. We employ a scalar field charged under U(1) gauge symmetry with a non-trivial VEV to provide an effective mass term to the EM field and thus break its conformal invariance. The primordial magneto-genesis takes place in the radiation dominated (RD) epoch, after the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) phase. As a result, our mechanism is naturally free from the over-production of electric fields due to high conductivity in the RD epoch, and the baryon isocurvature problem which takes place only if magneto-genesis happens before the ESWB phase. In addition, we find that a significant amount of PMFs can be generated when the scalar field experiences a tachyonic phase. In this case, the scalar field is light and weakly coupled and has negligible energy density compared to the cold dark matter, hence the strong coupling problem and the back-reaction problem are also absent. Therefore, our model is free from the above-mentioned problems that frequently appear in other primordial magneto-genesis scenarios.</p>

<p>2025-04-08, <strong>On the evidence of a dark matter density spike around the primary black hole in OJ 287</strong>, Debabrata Deb et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05715v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.05715v1</a></p>

<p>The central engine of blazar OJ~287 is arguably the most notable supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary candidate that emits nano-Hertz (nHz) gravitational waves. This inference is mainly due to our ability to predict and successfully monitor certain quasi-periodic doubly peaked high brightness flares with a period of $\sim$12 years from this blazer. The use of post-Newtonian accurate SMBH binary orbital description that includes the effects of higher order GW emission turned out to be a crucial ingredient for accurately predicting the epochs of such Bremsstrahlung flares in our SMBH binary central engine description for OJ~287. It was very recently argued that one should include the effects of dynamical friction, induced by certain dark matter density spikes around the primary SMBH, to explain the {\it observed} decay of SMBH binary orbit in OJ~287. Invoking binary pulsar timing-based arguments, measurements, and OJ~287’s orbital description, we show that observationally relevant SMBH binary orbital dynamics in OJ~287 are insensitive to dark matter-induced dynamical friction effects. This implies that we could only provide an upper bound on the spike index parameter rather than obtaining an observationally derived value, as argued by \cite{Chan2024}.</p>

<p>2025-04-08, <strong>Testing black holes in a perfect fluid dark matter environment using quasinormal modes</strong>, Qun Tan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05641v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.05641v1</a></p>

<p>This research explores the quasinormal modes (QNMs) characteristics of charged black holes in a perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) environment. Based on the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the M87* black hole shadow, we implemented necessary constraints on the parameter space($a/M$,$\lambda/M$).We found that for lower values of the magnetic charge parameter, the effective range of the PFDM parameter is approximately between -0.2 and 0, while as the magnetic charge parameter increases, this effective range gradually extends toward more negative values. Then through sixth-order WKB method and time-domain method, we systematically analyzed the quasinormal oscillation spectra under scalar field and electromagnetic field perturbations. The results reveal that: the magnetic charge $a$ and PFDM parameters $\lambda$ modulate the effective potential barrier of black hole spacetime, profoundly influencing the response frequency and energy dissipation characteristics of external perturbations. The consistently negative imaginary part of QNMs across the entire physical parameter domain substantiates the dynamical stability of the investigated system. Moreover, we discovered differences in the parameter variation sensitivity between scalar field and electromagnetic field perturbations, providing a theoretical basis for distinguishing different field disturbances. These results not only unveil the modulation mechanisms of electromagnetic interactions and dark matter distribution on black hole spacetime structures but also offer potential observational evidence for future gravitational wave detection and black hole environment identification.</p>

<p>2025-04-08, <strong>A systematic method to identify runaways from star clusters produced from single-binary interactions: A case study of M67</strong>, A. Herrera-Urquieta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06252v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.06252v1</a></p>

<p>One hypothesis for runaway stars (RSs) is that they are ejected from star clusters with high velocities relative to the cluster center-of-mass motion. There are two competing mechanisms for their production: supernova-based ejections in binaries, where one companion explodes, leaves no remnant, and launches the other companion at the instantaneous orbital velocity, and the disintegration of triples (or higher-order multiples), which produces a recoiled runaway binary (RB) and an RS. We search for RS candidates using data from the Gaia DR3 survey with a focus on triple disintegration since in this case the product is always a binary and a single star that should be moving in opposite directions. We created a systematic methodology to look for candidate RS-RB runaway pairs produced from the disintegration of bound three-body systems formed from single-binary interactions based on momentum conservation and causality. The method we use is general and can be applied to any cluster with a 5D kinematic data set. We used our criteria to search for these pairs in a 150 pc circular field of view surrounding the open cluster M67, which we used as a benchmark cluster to test the robustness of our method. Our results reveal only one RS-RB pair that is consistent with all of our selection criteria out of an initial sample of $10^8$ pairs.</p>

<p>2025-04-08, <strong>SOFIA/upGREAT imaging spectroscopy of the [C II] 158 um fine structure line toward the Sgr A region in the Galactic center</strong>, A. I. Harris et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06228v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.06228v1</a></p>

<p>We present SOFIA/upGREAT velocity-resolved spectral imaging and analysis of the 158 um [C II] spectral line toward the central 80 by 43\,pc region of the Central Molecular Zone of the Galaxy. The field we imaged with 14” (0.6 pc) spatial and 1 km/s spectral resolution contains the Circum-Nuclear Disk (CND) around the central black hole Sgr A*, the neighboring thermal Arched Filaments, the nonthermal filaments of the Radio Arc, and the three luminous central star clusters. [C II] traces emission from the CND’s inner edge to material orbiting at a distance of approximately 6 pc. Its velocity field reveals no sign of inflowing material nor interaction with winds from the Sgr A East supernova remnant. Wide-field imaging of the Sgr A region shows multiple circular segments, including the thermal Arched Filaments, that are centered on a region that includes the Quintuplet cluster. We examine the possibility that the Arched Filaments and other large-scale arcs trace transient excitation events from supernova blast waves. Along the Arched Filaments, comparisons among far-IR fine structure lines show changes in ionization state over small scales and that high-excitation lines are systematically shifted in position from the other lines. These also point to transient fast winds that shocked on the surface of the Arches cloud to produce additional local UV radiation to excite the Arched Filaments on a cloud surface illuminated by UV from hot stars.</p>

<p>2025-04-08, <strong>Cosmic ray transport and acceleration with magnetic mirroring</strong>, A. R. Bell et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06140v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.06140v1</a></p>

<p>We analyse the transport of cosmic rays (CR) in magnetic fields that are structured on scales greater than the CR Larmor radius. We solve the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equation for various mixes of mirroring and small-angle scattering and show that relatively small deviations from a uniform magnetic field can induce mirroring and inhibit CR transport to levels that mimic Bohm diffusion in which the CR mean free path is comparable with the CR Larmor radius. Our calculations suggest that shocks may accelerate CR to the Hillas (1984) energy without the need for magnetic field amplification on the Larmor scale. This re-opens the possibility, subject to more comprehensive simulations, that young supernova remnants may be accelerating CR to PeV energies, and maybe even to higher energies beyond the knee in the energy spectrum. We limit our discussion of CR acceleration to shocks that are non-relativistic.</p>

<p>2025-04-08, <strong>Dynamical Dark Energy in light of the DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations Measurements</strong>, Gan Gu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06118v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.06118v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate whether dark energy deviates from the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM) by analyzing baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Data Release 1 (DR1) and Data Release 2 (DR2) of DESI observations, in combination with Type Ia supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance information. We find that with the larger statistical power and wider redshift coverage of the DR2 dataset the preference for dynamical dark energy does not decrease and remains at approximately the same statistical significance as for DESI~DR1. Employing both a shape-function reconstruction and non-parametric methods with a correlation prior derived from Horndeski theory, we consistently find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift. While DESI DR1 and DR2 BAO data alone provide modest constraints, combining them with independent SNe samples (PantheonPlus, Union3, and the DES 5-year survey) and a CMB distance prior strengthens the evidence for dynamical dark energy. Bayesian model-selection tests show moderate support for dark energy dynamics when multiple degrees of freedom in $w(z)$ are allowed, pointing to increasing tension with $\Lambda$CDM at a level of roughly $3\sigma$ (or more in certain data combinations). Although the methodology adopted in this work is different from those used in companion DESI papers, we find consistent results, demonstrating the complementarity of dark energy studies performed by the DESI collaboration. Although possible systematic effects must be carefully considered, it currently seems implausible that $\Lambda$CDM will be rescued by future high-precision surveys, such as the complete DESI, Euclid, and next-generation CMB experiments. These results therefore highlight the possibility of new physics driving cosmic acceleration and motivate further investigation into dynamical dark energy models.</p>

<p>2025-04-08, <strong>The Ultraviolet Spectra of 2003fg-like Type Ia Supernovae</strong>, Snehasish Bhattacharjee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05869v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.05869v1</a></p>

<p>2003fg-like Type Ia supernovae (03fg-like SNe Ia) are a rare subtype of SNe Ia, photometrically characterized by broader optical light curves and bluer ultraviolet (UV) colors compared to normal SNe Ia. In this work, we study four 03fg-like SNe Ia using Swift UltraViolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) grism observations to understand their unique UV properties and progenitor scenario(s). We report 03fg-like SNe Ia to have similar UV features and elemental compositions as normal SNe Ia, but with higher UV flux relative to optical. Previous studies have suggested that the UV flux levels of normal SNe Ia could be influenced by their progenitor properties, such as metallicity, with metal-poor progenitors producing higher UV flux levels. While 03fg-like SNe were previously reported to occur in low-mass and metal-poor host environments, our analysis indicates that their UV excess cannot be explained by their host-galaxy parameters. Instead, we demonstrate that the addition of a hot blackbody component, likely arising from the interaction with the circumstellar material (CSM), to the normal SN Ia spectrum, can reproduce their distinctive UV excess. This supports the hypothesis that 03fg-like SNe Ia could explode in a CSM-rich environment.</p>

<p>Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), the thermonuclear explosions of C/O white dwarf stars in binary systems, are phenomena that remain poorly understood. The complexity of their progenitor systems, explosion physics and intrinsic diversity poses not only challenges for their understanding as astrophysical objects, but also for their standardization and use as cosmological probes. Near-infrared (NIR) observations offer a promising avenue for studying the physics of SNeIa and for reducing systematic uncertainties in distance estimations, as they exhibit lower dust extinction and smaller dispersion in peak luminosity than optical bands. Here, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to a sample of SNeIa with well-sampled NIR (YJH-band) light curves to identify the dominant components of their variability and constrain physical underlying properties. The theoretical models of Kasen2006 are used for the physical interpretation of the PCA components, where we found the 56Ni mass to describe the dominant variability. Other factors, such as mixing and metallicity, were found to contribute significantly as well. However, some differences are found between the components of the NIR bands which may be attributed to differences in the explosion aspects they each trace. Additionally, the PCA components are compared to various light-curve parameters, identifying strong correlations between some components and peak brightness in both the NIR and optical bands, particularly in the Y band. When applying PCA to NIR color curves, we found interesting correlations with the host-galaxy mass, where SNeIa with redder NIR colors are predominantly found in less massive galaxies. We also investigate the potential for improved standardization in the Y band by incorporating PCA coefficients as correction parameters, leading to a reduction in the scatter of the intrinsic luminosity of SNeIa.</p>
