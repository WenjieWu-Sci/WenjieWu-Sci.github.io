<p>2023-10-26, <strong>Soft supersymmetry breaking as the sole origin of neutrino masses and lepton number violation</strong>, Anjan S. Joshipura et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17472v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.17472v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss a scenario in which the supergravity induced soft terms, conventionally used for breaking supersymmetry, also lead to non-zero Majorana neutrino masses. The soft terms lead to the spontaneous violation of the lepton number at the gravitino mass scale $m_{3/2}$ which in turn leads to (i) the Majorana masses of ${\cal O} (m_{3/2})$ for the right-handed neutrinos and (ii) the $R$-parity breaking at the same scale. The former contributes to light neutrino masses through the type I seesaw mechanism, while the latter adds to it through neutrino-neutralino mixing. Both contributions can scale inversely with respect to $m_{3/2}$ given that gaugino and Higgsino masses are also of order $m_{3/2}$. Together, these two contributions adequately explain observed neutrino masses and mixing. One realization of the scenario also naturally leads to a $\mu$ parameter of ${\cal O} (m_{3/2})$. Despite the lepton number symmetry breaking close to the weak scale, the Majoron in the model exhibits very weak coupling to leptons, satisfying existing constraints on Majoron-lepton interactions. The right-handed neutrinos in the model have a large coupling to Higgsinos. This coupling and the relatively large heavy-light neutrino mixing induced through the seesaw mechanism can lead to the observable signals at colliders in terms of displaced vertices.</p>

<p>2023-10-26, <strong>Long-lived HNLs at lepton colliders as a probe of left-right symmetric models</strong>, Kevin A. Urquía-Calderón et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17406v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.17406v1</a></p>

<p>Left-right symmetric models (LRSM) were proposed to reconcile the apparent parity violation in weak interactions with our intrinsic notion of fundamental parity symmetry. It was quickly realized that LRSM offers a viable framework for explaining neutrino masses by incorporating right-handed neutrinos, $N$, into its spectrum. In this study, we investigate for the first time the potential of future lepton colliders (including the FCC-ee, CEPC, ILC, CLIC, and a muon collider) to detect signals stemming from $N$’s, focusing primarily on displaced vertex signals, and on prompt signals to a lesser degree. Our results demonstrate that these signals can effectively probe the characteristic scales of LRSM, providing evidence that would be unobtainable through any other experimental means.</p>

<p>2023-10-26, <strong>Reconstructing the early-universe expansion and thermal history</strong>, Rui An et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17195v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.17195v1</a></p>

<p>We present a model-independent reconstruction of the early expansion and thermal histories of the universe, obtained from light element abundance measurements. The expansion history is tightly constrained around the onset of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). The temperature of photons is additionally constrained around the time of neutrino decoupling. Allowing for perturbations to the standard expansion rate, we find that the radiation energy density is constrained to within 15% of its $\Lambda$CDM value, and only 1% extra matter energy density is allowed around the epoch of BBN. We introduce a new and general analytic fitting formula for the temperature variation, which is flexible enough to reproduce the signal of large classes of beyond-CDM particle models that can alter the temperature through early-time energy injection. We present its constraints from BBN data and from the measurements of effective number of relativistic species and helium-4 abundance probed by the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation anisotropy. Our results provide clarity on the most fundamental properties of the early universe, reconstructed with minimal assumptions about the unknown physics that can occur at keV–MeV energy scales and can be mapped to broad classes of models of interest to cosmology.</p>

<p>2023-10-26, <strong>Novel moduli space in modular flavor models : a case study for modular $T’$ seesaw model with hidden $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry</strong>, Keiya Ishiguro et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17068v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.17068v1</a></p>

<p>We study flavor phenomenologies in a basis of a double covering of modular $A_4$ group with a hidden $SU(2)$ symmetry, in which we work on regions at nearby two fixed points and three special points. These special points of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ moduli space are statistically favored in flux compactifications of Type IIB string theory. Neutrino masses are approximately obtained by using the seesaw mechanism due to our two additional symmetries. We perform chi square numerical analysis for each of the fixed/special points in the normal and inverted hierarchies and demonstrate predictions for each case. Then, we briefly discuss the possible signature of hidden gauge bosons at collider experiments from the hidden $SU(2)$ symmetry.</p>

<p>2023-10-26, <strong>Fermion Proca Stars: Vector Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars</strong>, Cédric Jockel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17291v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.17291v1</a></p>

<p>Dark matter could accumulate around neutron stars in sufficient amounts to affect their global properties. In this work, we study the effect of a specific model for dark matter – a massive and self-interacting vector (spin-1) field – on neutron stars. We describe the combined systems of neutron stars and vector dark matter using Einstein-Proca theory coupled to a nuclear-matter term, and find scaling relations between the field and metric components in the equations of motion. We construct equilibrium solutions of the combined systems, compute their masses and radii and also analyse their stability and higher modes. The combined systems admit dark matter (DM) core and cloud solutions. Core solutions compactify the neutron star component and tend to decrease the total mass of the combined system. Cloud solutions have the inverse effect. Electromagnetic observations of certain cloud-like configurations would appear to violate the Buchdahl limit. This could make Buchdahl-limit violating objects smoking gun signals for dark matter in neutron stars. The self-interaction strength is found to significantly affect both mass and radius. We also compare fermion Proca stars to objects where the dark matter is modelled using a complex scalar field. We find that fermion Proca stars tend to be more massive and geometrically larger than their scalar field counterparts for equal boson masses and self-interaction strengths. Both systems can produce degenerate masses and radii for different amounts of DM and DM particle masses.</p>

<p>2023-10-26, <strong>Using two point correlation functions to understand the assembly histories of Milky Way-like galaxies</strong>, Yike Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17104v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.17104v1</a></p>

<p>The two point correlation function (2PCF) is a powerful statistical tool to measure galaxy clustering. Although 2PCF has also been used to study the clustering of stars on parsec and sub-parsec scales, its physical implication is not clear on such non-linear scales. In this study, we use the Illustris-TNG50 simulation to study the connection between the 2PCF signals of accreted halo stars and the assembly histories of Milky Way-mass galaxies. We find, in general, the 2PCF signal increases with the increase in galactocentric radii, $r$, and with the decrease in the pair separations. Galaxies which assemble late on average have stronger 2PCF signals. With $z_{1/4}$, $z_{1/2}$ and $z_{3/4}$ defined as the redshifts when galaxies accreted one-fourth, half and three-fourths of their ex-situ stellar mass at today, we find all of them show the strongest correlations with the 2PCF signals at $r\sim0.2R_{200}$. $z_{3/4}$ shows the strongest correlations at all radii than those of $z_{1/4}$ or $z_{1/2}$, as later accreted stars preserve better clusterings. However, the correlations between the 2PCF signals at different radii and the galaxy formation times all have large scatters. The 2PCFs in velocity space show weaker correlations with the galaxy formation times within $0.38R_{200}$ than real space 2PCFs, and the scatter is considerably large. Both the real and velocity space 2PCFs correlate with the assembly histories of the host dark matter halos as well. Within $0.38R_{200}$, the real space 2PCF shows stronger correlations with the galaxy formation histories than with the halo formation histories, while the velocity space 2PCFs do not show large differences. We conclude that it is difficult to use 2PCF alone to precisely predict the formation times or assembly histories of galaxies.</p>

<p>2023-10-26, <strong>Dark matter signatures of black holes with Yukawa potential</strong>, A. A. Araújo Filho et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17081v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.17081v1</a></p>

<p>This study uses a nonsingular Yukawa–modified potential to obtain a static and spherically symmetric black hole solution with a cosmological constant. Such Yukawa–like corrections are encoded in two parameters, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, that modify Newton’s law of gravity in large distances, and a deformation parameter $\ell_0$, which plays an essential role in short distances. The most significant effect is encoded in $\alpha$, which modifies the total black hole mass with an extra mass proportional to $\alpha M$, mimicking the dark matter effects at large distances from the black hole. On the other hand, the effect due to $\lambda$ is small for astrophysical values. We scrutinize the \textit{quasinormal} frequencies and shadows associated with a spherically symmetric black hole and the thermodynamical behavior influenced by the Yukawa potential. In particular, the thermodynamics of this black hole displays a rich behavior, including possible phase transitions. We use the WKB method to probe the \textit{quasinormal} modes of massless scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational field perturbations. In order to check the influence of the parameters on the shadow radius, we consider astrophysical data to determine their values, incorporating information on an optically thin radiating and infalling gas surrounding a black hole to model the black hole shadow image. In particular, we consider Sgr A* black hole as an example and we find that its shadow radius changes by order of $10^{-9}$, meaning that the shadow radius of a black hole with Yukawa potential practically gives rise to the same result encountered in the Schwarzschild black hole. Also, in the eikonal regime, using astrophysical data for Yukawa parameters, we show that the value of the real part of the QNMs frequencies changes by $10^{-18}$.</p>

<p>2023-10-26, <strong>Does or did the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A operate as a PeVatron?</strong>, Zhen Cao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17082v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2310.17082v1</a></p>

<p>For decades, supernova remnants (SNRs) have been considered the prime sources of Galactic Cosmic rays (CRs). But whether SNRs can accelerate CR protons to PeV energies and thus dominate CR flux up to the knee is currently under intensive theoretical and phenomenological debate. The direct test of the ability of SNRs to operate as CR PeVatrons can be provided by ultrahigh-energy (UHE; $E_\gamma \geq 100$~TeV) $\gamma$-rays. In this context, the historical SNR Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is considered one of the most promising target for UHE observations. This paper presents the observation of Cas A and its vicinity by the LHAASO KM2A detector. The exceptional sensitivity of LHAASO KM2A in the UHE band, combined with the young age of Cas A, enabled us to derive stringent model-independent limits on the energy budget of UHE protons and nuclei accelerated by Cas A at any epoch after the explosion. The results challenge the prevailing paradigm that Cas A-type SNRs are major suppliers of PeV CRs in the Milky Way.</p>
