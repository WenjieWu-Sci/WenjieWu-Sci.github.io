<p>2023-05-25, <strong>First measurement of $η$ production in neutrino interactions on argon with MicroBooNE</strong>, MicroBooNE collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16249v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.16249v1</a></p>

<p>We present a measurement of $\eta$ production from neutrino interactions on argon with the MicroBooNE detector. The modeling of resonant neutrino interactions on argon is a critical aspect of the neutrino oscillation physics program being carried out by the DUNE and Short Baseline Neutrino programs. $\eta$ production in neutrino interactions provides a powerful new probe of resonant interactions, complementary to pion channels, and is particularly suited to the study of higher-order resonances beyond the $\Delta(1232)$. We measure a flux-integrated cross section for neutrino-induced $\eta$ production on argon of $3.22 \pm 0.84 \; \textrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.86 \; \textrm{(syst.)}$ $10^{-41}{\textrm{cm}}^{2}$/nucleon. By demonstrating the successful reconstruction of the two photons resulting from $\eta$ production, this analysis enables a novel calibration technique for electromagnetic showers in GeV accelerator neutrino experiments.</p>

<p>2023-05-25, <strong>Capability of the proposed long-baseline experiments to probe large extra dimension</strong>, Samiran Roy et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16234v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.16234v1</a></p>

<p>Future long-baseline experiments will play an important role in exploring physics beyond the standard model. One such new physics concept is the large extra dimension (LED), which provides an elegant solution to the hierarchy problem. This model also explains the small neutrino mass in a natural way. The presence of LED modifies the standard neutrino oscillation probabilities. Hence, the long-baseline experiments are sensitive to the LED parameters. We explore the potential of the three future long-baseline neutrino experiments, namely T2HK, ESSnuSB, and DUNE, to probe the LED parameter space. We also compare the capability of the charged and neutral current measurements at DUNE to constrain the LED model. We find that T2HK will provide more stringent bounds on the largest compactification radius ($R_{\rm{ED}}$) compared to the DUNE and ESSnuSB experiments. At $90\%$ C.L., T2HK can exclude $R_{\rm{ED}}\sim 0.45~(0.425)$ $\mu$m for the normal (inverted) mass hierarchy scenario.</p>

<p>2023-05-25, <strong>An Optically Targeted Search for Gravitational Waves emitted by Core-Collapse Supernovae during the Third Observing Run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo</strong>, Marek J. Szczepańczyk et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16146v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.16146v1</a></p>

<p>We present the results from a search for gravitational-wave transients associated with core-collapse supernovae observed optically within 30 Mpc during the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. No gravitational wave associated with a core-collapse supernova has been identified. We then report the detection efficiency for a variety of possible gravitational-wave emissions. For neutrino-driven explosions, the distance at which we reach 50% detection efficiency is up to 8.9 kpc, while more energetic magnetorotationally-driven explosions are detectable at larger distances. The distance reaches for selected models of the black hole formation, and quantum chromodynamics phase transition are also provided. We then constrain the core-collapse supernova engine across a wide frequency range from 50 Hz to 2 kHz. The upper limits on gravitational-wave energy and luminosity emission are at low frequencies down to $10^{-4}\,M_\odot c^2$ and $5 \times 10^{-4}\,M_\odot c^2$/s, respectively. The upper limits on the proto-neutron star ellipticity are down to 5 at high frequencies. Finally, by combining the results obtained with the data from the first and second observing runs of LIGO and Virgo, we improve the constraints of the parameter spaces of the extreme emission models. Specifically, the proto-neutron star ellipticities for the long-lasting bar mode model are down to 1 for long emission (1 s) at high frequency.</p>

<p>2023-05-25, <strong>Cosmic Energy Density: Particles, Fields and the Vacuum</strong>, Cristian Armendariz-Picon et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16293v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.16293v1</a></p>

<p>We revisit the cosmic evolution of the energy density of a quantized free scalar field and assess under what conditions the particle production and classical field approximations reproduce its correct value. Because the unrenormalized energy-momentum tensor diverges in the ultraviolet, it is necessary to frame our discussion within an appropriate regularization and renormalization scheme. Pauli-Villars avoids some of the drawbacks of adiabatic subtraction and dimensional regularization and is particularly convenient in this context. In some cases, we can predict the evolution of the energy density irrespectively of the quantum state of the field modes. To further illustrate our results we focus however on the {\it in} vacuum, the preferred quantum state singled out by inflation, and explore to what extent the latter determines the subsequent evolution of the energy density regardless of the unknown details of reheating. We contrast this discussion with examples of transitions to radiation domination that avoid some of the problems of the one commonly studied in the literature, and point out some instances in which the particle production or the classical field approximations lead to the incorrect energy density. Along the way, we also elaborate on the connection of our analysis to dynamical dark energy models and axion-like dark matter candidates.</p>

<p>2023-05-25, <strong>Model-independent reconstruction of the Interacting Dark Energy Kernel: Binned and Gaussian process</strong>, Luis A. Escamilla et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16290v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.16290v1</a></p>

<p>The cosmological dark sector remains an enigma, offering numerous possibilities for exploration. One particularly intriguing option is the (non-minimal) interaction scenario between dark matter and dark energy. In this paper, to investigate this scenario, we have implemented Binned and Gaussian model-independent reconstructions for the interaction kernel alongside the equation of state; while using data from BAOs, Pantheon+ and Cosmic Chronometers. In addition to the reconstruction process, we conducted a model selection to analyze how our methodology performed against the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our results revealed a slight indication for some oscillatory dynamics in the interaction kernel and, as a by-product, also in DE and DM. A consequence of this outcome is the possibility of a sign change in the direction of the energy transfer between DE and DM and a possible transition from a negative DE energy density in early-times to a positive one at late-times. While our reconstructions provided a better fit to the data compared to the standard model, the Bayesian Evidence showed an intrinsic penalization due to the extra degrees of freedom. Nevertheless these reconstructions could be used as a basis for other physical models with lower complexity but similar behavior.</p>

<p>2023-05-25, <strong>Convergence of small scale Ly$α$ structure at high-$z$ under different reionization scenarios</strong>, Caitlin C. Doughty et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16200v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.16200v1</a></p>

<p>The Ly$\alpha$ forest (LAF) at $z&gt;5$ probes the thermal and reionization history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the nature of dark matter, but its interpretation requires comparison to cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. At high-$z$, convergence of these simulations is more exacting since transmission is dominated by underdense voids that are challenging to resolve. With evidence mounting for a late end to reionization, small structures down to the sub-kpc level may survive to later times than conventionally thought due to the reduced time for pressure smoothing to impact the gas, further tightening simulation resolution requirements. We perform a suite of simulations using the Eulerian cosmological hydrodynamics code Nyx, spanning domain sizes of 1.25-10 $h^{-1}$ Mpc and 5-80 $h^{-1}$ kpc cells, and explore the interaction of these variables with the timing of reionization on the properties of the matter distribution and the simulated LAF at $z=5.5$. In observable Ly$\alpha$ power, convergence within 10% is achieved for $k&lt; 0.1$ s/km, but larger $k$ shows deviation of up to 20 percent. While a later reionization retains more small structure in the density field, because of the greater thermal broadening there is little difference in the convergence of LAF power between early ($z=9$) and later ($z=6$) reionizations. We conclude that at $z\sim5.5$, resolutions of 10 kpc are necessary for convergence of LAF power at $k&lt;0.1$ s/km, while higher-$k$ modes require higher resolution, and that the timing of reionization does not significantly impact convergence given realistic photoheating.</p>

<p>2023-05-25, <strong>A Parametric Model for Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos</strong>, Daneng Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16176v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.16176v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a parametric model for studying self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. The model uses an analytical density profile, calibrated using a controlled N-body SIDM simulation that covers the entire gravothermal evolution, including core-forming and -collapsing phases. By normalizing the calibrated density profile, we obtain a universal description for SIDM halos at any evolution phase. The model allows us to infer properties of SIDM halos based on their cold dark matter (CDM) counterparts. As a basic application, we only require two characteristic parameters of an isolated CDM halo at $z=0$. We then extend the model to incorporate effects induced by halo mass changes, such as major mergers or tidal stripping, making it applicable to both isolated halos and subhalos. The parametric model is tested and validated using cosmological zoom-in SIDM simulations available in the literature.</p>

<p>2023-05-25, <strong>Dark Higgs Bosons at Colliders</strong>, Torben Ferber et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16169v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.16169v1</a></p>

<p>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has confirmed the Higgs mechanism to be responsible for generating mass in the Standard Model (SM), making it attractive to also consider spontaneous symmetry breaking as the origin of mass for new particles in a dark sector extension of the SM. Such a dark Higgs mechanism may in particular give mass to a dark matter candidate and to the gauge boson mediating its interactions (called dark photon). In this review we summarise the phenomenology of the resulting dark Higgs boson and discuss the corresponding search strategies with a focus on collider experiments. We consider both the case that the dark Higgs boson is heavier than the SM Higgs boson, in which case leading constraints come from direct searches for new Higgs bosons as well missing-energy searches at the LHC, and the case that the dark Higgs boson is (potentially much) lighter than the SM Higgs boson, such that the leading sensitivity comes from electron-positron colliders and fixed-target experiments. Of particular experimental interest for both cases is the associated production of a dark Higgs boson with a dark photon, which subsequently decays into SM fermions, dark matter particles or long-lived dark sector states. We also discuss the important role of exotic decays of the SM-like Higgs boson and complementary constraints arising from early-universe cosmology, astrophysics and direct searches for dark matter in laboratory experiments.</p>

<p>2023-05-25, <strong>Non-thermal warm dark matter limits from small-scale structure</strong>, Arka Banerjee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15736v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.15736v1</a></p>

<p>We present small-scale structure constraints on sterile dark matter produced from a heavy mediator particle, inspired by models of moduli decay. Dark matter particles produced through this mechanism can contribute to the entire dark matter energy density but the particles have a non-thermal phase-space distribution; however, we show that the resulting linear matter power spectra can be mapped to effective thermal-relic warm dark matter models. This production mechanism is therefore subject to warm dark matter constraints from small-scale structure as probed by ultra-faint dwarf galaxy abundances and strong gravitational lensing flux ratio statistics. We use the correspondence to thermal-relic models to derive a lower bound on the non-thermal particle mass of $107\ \mathrm{keV}$, at $95\%$ confidence. These are the first and most stringent constraints derived on sterile dark matter produced via the heavy mediator decay scenario we consider.</p>

<p>2023-05-25, <strong>Solution To The Cosmic Rays Puzzle ?</strong>, Shlomo Dado et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16003v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2305.16003v1</a></p>

<p>Recent observations provide compelling evidence that the bulk of the high energy cosmic rays (CRs) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are co-produced by highly relativistic jets of plasmoids of stellar matter. These jets are launched by fall back matter on newly born neutron stars and stellar black holes in core collapse of stripped envelope massive stars with or without an associated supernova. The electrons in the plasmoids produce GRB pulses mainly by inverse Compton scattering of photons on their path, while magnetic reflection of the charged particles produces the high energy cosmic rays.</p>
