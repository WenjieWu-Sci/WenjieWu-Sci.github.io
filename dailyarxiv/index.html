<p>2025-02-24, <strong>Playing with lepton asymmetry at the resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter</strong>, Dmitry Gorbunov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17374v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.17374v1</a></p>

<p>We examine the sterile neutrino dark matter production in the primordial plasma with lepton asymmetry unequally distributed over different neutrino flavors. We argue that with the specific flavor fractions, one can mitigate limits from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on the sterile-active neutrino mixing angle and sterile neutrino mass. It happens due to cancellation of the neutrino flavor asymmetries in active neutrino oscillations, which is more efficient in the case of inverse hierarchy of active neutrino masses and does not depend on the value of CP-phase. This finding opens a window of lower sterile-active mixing angles. Likewise, we show that, with lepton asymmetry disappearing from the plasma at certain intermediate stages of the sterile neutrino production, the spectrum of produced neutrinos becomes much colder, which weakens the limits on the model parameter space from observations of cosmic small-scale structures (Ly-$\alpha$ forest, galaxy counts, etc.). This finding reopens the region of lighter sterile neutrinos. The new region may be explored with the next generation of X-ray telescopes searching for the inherent peak signature provided by the dark matter sterile neutrino radiative decays in the Galaxy.</p>

<p>We analyze the cross section for inverse beta decay, focusing on the moderate energies (a few MeV to hundreds of MeV) relevant for reactor and supernova neutrinos. We discuss the updated evaluations of values and uncertainties in the cross section, and the effect of second-class currents. The estimate of theoretical precision is important for current and future experiments, when large data samples are or become available.</p>

<p>2025-02-24, <strong>Neutron multiplicity measurement in muon capture on oxygen nuclei in the Gd-loaded Super-Kamiokande detector</strong>, The Super-Kamiokande Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17002v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.17002v1</a></p>

<p>In recent neutrino detectors, neutrons produced in neutrino reactions play an important role. Muon capture on oxygen nuclei is one of the processes that produce neutrons in water Cherenkov detectors. We measured neutron multiplicity in the process using cosmic ray muons that stop in the gadolinium-loaded Super-Kamiokande detector. For this measurement, neutron detection efficiency is obtained with the muon capture events followed by gamma rays to be $50.2^{+2.0}_{-2.1}\%$. By fitting the observed multiplicity considering the detection efficiency, we measure neutron multiplicity in muon capture as $P(0)=24\pm3\%$, $P(1)=70^{+3}_{-2}\%$, $P(2)=6.1\pm0.5\%$, $P(3)=0.38\pm0.09\%$. This is the first measurement of the multiplicity of neutrons associated with muon capture without neutron energy threshold.</p>

<p>2025-02-24, <strong>Observe Gamma-Rays and Neutrinos Associated with Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays</strong>, Qinyuan Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16959v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.16959v1</a></p>

<p>IceCube measures a diffuse neutrino flux comparable to the Waxman-Bahcall bound, which suggests the possibility that the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) have a common origin with diffuse high energy neutrinos. We propose high energy gamma-ray and/or neutrino observations toward the arrival directions of UHECRs to search for the sources and test this possibility. We calculate the detection probability of gamma-ray/neutrino sources, and find that the average probability per UHECR of &gt;10 EeV is $\sim$10% if the sensitivity of the gamma-ray or neutrino telescope is $\sim$10$^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and the source number density is $\sim$10$^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. Future gamma-ray and neutrino observations toward UHECRs, e.g., by LHAASO-WCDA, CTA, IceCube/Gen2, are encouraged to constrain the density of UHECR sources or even identify the sources of UHECRs.</p>

<p>2025-02-24, <strong>Overall Ultra-high Energy Neutrino Emission from GRBs during Jet Expansion</strong>, Qinyuan Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16946v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.16946v1</a></p>

<p>The ultra-relativistic jet released in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is expected to produce ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), prompt gamma-ray emission and hence prompt high-energy neutrinos by photopion interactions. In this work, we calculate the time-integrated neutrino spectrum during the expansion of jets by taking into account the time evolution of cosmic ray and secondary spectra and neutrino production. We numerically solve the continuity equations for nucleons, pions, and muons for their spectral evolution. Since pion and muon damping weakens as the jet expands, the neutrino production at large radii at high energies may dominate that around the jet energy dissipation radius. Compared with the usually adopted approaches that only consider neutrino production around the energy dissipation radius, the overall UHE neutrino fluence integrated over time can be significantly larger, and the flavor fraction of electron neutrinos as function of neutrino energy is different at UHE, due to neutrino production at radii much larger than the energy dissipation radius. The faster magnetic field decay leads to larger UHE neutrino fluence, and the UHE neutrino spectra is weakly dependent on the energy dissipation radius and the jet Lorentz factor. Observations of prompt EeV neutrinos from GRBs by the next-generation neutrino telescopes, e.g., GRAND and IceCube-Gen2, will test the hypothesis of GRBs as UHECR sources and probe the physics of GRB jets.</p>

<p>2025-02-24, <strong>Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays from Active Galactic Nuclei Jets: The Role of Supermassive Black Hole Growth and Accretion States</strong>, Olmo Piana et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16873v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.16873v1</a></p>

<p>Jets emanating from active galactic nuclei (AGN) represent some of the most formidable particle accelerators in the universe, thereby emerging as viable candidates responsible for the detection of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). If AGN jets indeed serve as origins of UHECRs, then the diffuse flux of these cosmic rays would be dependent on the power and duty cycle of these jets, which are inherently connected to the nature of black hole accretion flows. In this article, we present our cosmological semi-analytic framework, JET(Jets from Early Times), designed to trace the evolution of jetted AGN populations. This framework serves as a valuable tool for predictive analyses of cosmic ray energy density and, potentially, neutrino energy density. By using JET, we model the formation and evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) from z = 20 to z = 1, incorporating jet formation and feedback mechanisms and distinguishing between various accretion states determined by the SMBH Eddington ratios. The implications of different SMBH growth models on predicting cosmic ray flux are investigated. We provide illustrative examples demonstrating how the associated diffuse UHECR fluxes at the source may vary in relation to the jet production efficiencies and the selected SMBH growth model, linking cosmological models of SMBH growth with astroparticle backgrounds.</p>

<p>2025-02-24, <strong>Unbiased estimates of the shapes of haloes using the positions of satellite galaxies</strong>, A. Herle et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17135v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.17135v1</a></p>

<p>The shapes of dark matter haloes are sensitive to both cosmology and baryon physics, but are difficult to measure observationally. A promising way to constrain them is to use the positions of satellite galaxies as tracers of the underlying dark matter, but there are typically too few galaxies per halo for reliable shape estimates, resulting in biased shapes. We present a method to model sampling noise to correct for the shape bias. We compare our predicted median shape bias with that obtained from the FLAMINGO suite of simulations and find reasonable agreement. We check that our results are robust to resolution effects and baryonic feedback. We also explore the validity of our bias correction at various redshifts and we discuss how our method might be applied to observations in the future. We show that median projected halo axis ratios are on average biased low by 0.31 when they are traced by only 5 satellites. Using the satellite galaxies, the projected host halo axis ratio can be corrected with a residual bias of ~ 0.1, by accounting for sampling bias. Hence, about two-thirds of the projected axis ratio bias can be explained by sampling noise. This enables the statistical measurement of halo shapes at lower masses than previously possible. Our method will also allow improved estimates of halo shapes in cosmological simulations using fewer particles than currently required.</p>

<p>2025-02-24, <strong>An experimental platform for levitated mechanics in space</strong>, Jack Homans et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17108v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.17108v1</a></p>

<p>Conducting levitated mechanical experiments in extreme conditions has long been the aim of researchers, as it allows for the investigation of new fundamental physics phenomena. One of the great frontiers has been sending these experiments into the micro-g environment of space, with multiple proposals calling for such a platform. At the same time, levitated sensors have demonstrated a high sensitivity to external stimuli which will only improve in low-vibrational conditions. conditions This paper describes the development of a technology demonstrator for optical and magnetic trapping experiments in space. Our payload represents the first concrete step towards future missions with aims of probing fundamental physical questions: matter-wave interferometry of nanoparticles to probe the limits of macroscopic quantum mechanics, detection of Dark Matter candidates and gravitational waves to test physics beyond the Standard Model, and accelerometry for Earth-observation.</p>

<p>2025-02-24, <strong>Conditional Diffusion-Flow models for generating 3D cosmic density fields: applications to f(R) cosmologies</strong>, Julieth Katherine Riveros et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17087v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2502.17087v1</a></p>

<p>Next-generation galaxy surveys promise unprecedented precision in testing gravity at cosmological scales. However, realising this potential requires accurately modelling the non-linear cosmic web. We address this challenge by exploring conditional generative modelling to create 3D dark matter density fields via score-based (diffusion) and flow-based methods. Our results demonstrate the power of diffusion models to accurately reproduce the matter power spectra and bispectra, even for unseen configurations. They also offer a significant speed-up with slightly reduced accuracy, when flow-based reconstructing the probability distribution function, but they struggle with higher-order statistics. To improve conditional generation, we introduce a novel multi-output model to develop feature representations of the cosmological parameters. Our findings offer a powerful tool for exploring deviations from standard gravity, combining high precision with reduced computational cost, thus paving the way for more comprehensive and efficient cosmological analyses</p>
