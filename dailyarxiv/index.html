<p>2025-04-03, <strong>Excitation of the Glashow resonance without neutrino beams</strong>, I. Alikhanov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02820v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.02820v1</a></p>

<p>The $s$-channel process $\bar\nu_ee^-\rightarrow W^-$(on-shell) is now referred to as the Glashow resonance and being searched for at kilometer-scale neutrino ice/water detectors like IceCube, Baikal-GVD or KM3NeT. After over a decade of observations, IceCube has recorded only a few relevant neutrino events such that further exploration yet remains necessary for unambiguous confirmation of the existence of this resonant interaction. Meanwhile, its experimental discovery would provide an additional important test of the Standard Model. One might therefore ask: are there reactions with the Glashow resonance that would not necessitate having initial (anti)neutrino beams? This article suggests a surprisingly positive answer to the question $-$ namely, that the process may proceed in electron-positron collisions at accelerator energies, occurring as $e^+e^-\rightarrow W^-\rho(770)^+$. Although the resonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent, quite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of $\rho^+$ from the initial state converts the incident $e^+$ into $\bar\nu_e$. Likewise, the CP conjugate channel, $\nu_e e^+\rightarrow W^+$, takes the form $e^+e^-\rightarrow W^+\rho(770)^-$. Similar reactions with muons are also possible. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance in laboratory conditions.</p>

<p>2025-04-03, <strong>Measuring the Low-Energy Weak Mixing Angle with Supernova Neutrinos</strong>, Chun-Ming Yip et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02447v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.02447v1</a></p>

<p>The weak mixing angle $\theta_W$ is a fundamental parameter in the electroweak theory with a value running according to the energy scale, and its precision measurement in the low-energy regime is still ongoing. We propose a method to measure the low-energy $\sin{^2\theta_W}$ by taking advantage of Argo, a future ton-scale liquid argon dark matter detector, and the neutrino flux from a nearby core-collapse supernova (CCSN). We evaluate the expected precision of this measurement through the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) channel. We show that Argo is potentially capable of achieving a few percent determination of $\sin{^2\theta_W}$, at the momentum transfer of $q \sim 20$ MeV, in the observation of a CCSN within $\sim 3$ kpc from the Earth. Such a measurement is valuable for both the precision test of the electroweak theory and searching for new physics beyond the standard model in the neutrino sector.</p>

<p>2025-04-03, <strong>Quantization of massive fermions in vacuum and external fields</strong>, Maxim Dvornikov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02365v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.02365v1</a></p>

<p>We study massive Majorana neutrinos in background matter. Representing these particles in terms of Weyl spinors, we carry out their quantization. The propagators of these fields are also constructed. Then, we apply the Hamilton dynamics based formalism to describe massive Majorana neutrinos in matter on the classical level. Finally, we study a classical Dirac particle in vacuum, described with $c$-number variables, within the Hamiton formalism. Such a Dirac field is also canonically quantized.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>Weak-lensing tunnel voids in simulated light-cones: a new pipeline to investigate modified gravity and massive neutrinos signatures</strong>, Leonardo Maggiore et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02041v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.02041v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmic voids offer a unique opportunity to explore modified gravity (MG) models. Their low-density nature and vast extent make them especially sensitive to cosmological scenarios of the class $f(R)$, which incorporate screening mechanisms in dense, compact regions. Weak lensing (WL) by voids, in particular, provides a direct probe for testing MG scenarios. While traditional voids are identified from 3D galaxy positions, 2D voids detected in WL maps trace underdense regions along the line of sight and are sensitive to unbiased matter distribution. To investigate this, we developed an efficient pipeline for identifying and analyzing tunnel voids, i.e., underdensities detected in WL maps, specifically in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the convergence. In this work, we used this pipeline to generate realistic SNR maps from cosmological simulations featuring different $f(R)$ scenarios and massive neutrinos, comparing their effects against the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Using the convergence maps and the 2D void catalogs, we analyzed various statistics, including the probability density function, angular power spectrum, and void size function. We then focused on the tangential shear profile around 2D voids, demonstrating how the proposed void-finding algorithm maximizes the signal. We showed that MG leads to deeper void shear profiles due to the enhanced evolution of cosmic structures, while massive neutrinos have the opposite effect. Furthermore, we found that parametric functions typically applied to 3D void density profiles are not suitable for deriving the shear profiles of tunnel voids. We, therefore, proposed a new parametric formula that provides an excellent fit to the void shear profiles across different void sizes and cosmological models. Finally, we tested the sensitivity of the free parameters of this new formula to the cosmological model.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>Interference with Gravitational Instability: Hot and Fuzzy Dark Matter</strong>, Rayne Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01937v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01937v1</a></p>

<p>Wave or fuzzy dark matter produced with high momenta behaves in many ways like hot particle dark matter while also possessing seemingly different phenomenology due to wave interference. We develop wave perturbation theory to show that white noise density fluctuations generated by the interference of high-momenta waves are gravitationally unstable in the usual way during matter domination above the free streaming scale and stabilize below the free streaming scale, much like the analogous effects for massive neutrinos in hot dark matter. We verify and illustrate these effects in the density power spectra of Newtonian Schr"odinger-Poisson simulations. In the cosmological context, this would cause a gradual suppression of the initial white noise isocurvature perturbations below the free streaming scale at matter radiation equality, unlike cold dark matter isocurvature fluctuations, and virial stability of dark matter halos.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>A minimal Pati-Salam theory: from cosmic defects to gravitational waves and colliders</strong>, Goran SenjanoviÄ et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01893v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01893v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss a minimal renormalizable Pati-Salam theory based on the $SU(4)_{\rm C}\,\times\,SU(2)_{\rm L}\,\times\,SU(2)_{\rm R}$ gauge group, with unification scale Higgs multiplets taken as $SU(2)_{\rm L}$ and $SU(2)_{\rm R}$ doublets, which lead to neutrino Dirac picture. Although a number of scalar particles could be light, even lying at the LHC energies, the unification scale is hopelessly out of reach in any foreseeable future. Moreover, phase transition in the early Universe leads to the production of magnetic monopoles and domain walls, both incompatible with the standard cosmological model. A small explicit breaking of the discrete left-right symmetry allows the domain walls to decay, and in the process possibly sweep away the monopoles, analogously to the previously discussed case of $SU(5)$ grand unified theory. This leaves an important imprint of gravitational waves, within the reach of next generation searches, correlated with monopole detection and new light particles at collider energies. The theory has a dark matter candidate in the form of an inert scalar doublet, with a mass below TeV, which can further trigger electroweak baryogenesis.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>Studies of Hadronic Showers in SND@LHC</strong>, The SND@LHC Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01716v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01716v1</a></p>

<p>The SND@LHC experiment was built for observing neutrinos arising from LHC pp collisions. The detector consists of two sections: a target instrumented with SciFi modules and a hadronic calorimeter/muon detector. Energetic $\nu$N collisions in the target produce hadronic showers. Reconstruction of the shower total energy requires an estimate of the fractions deposited in both the target and the calorimeter. In order to calibrate the SND@LHC response, a replica of the detector was exposed to hadron beams with 100 to 300 GeV in the CERN SPS H8 test beam line in Summer 2023. This report describes the methods developed to tag the presence of a shower, to locate the shower origin in the target, and to combine the target SciFi and the calorimeter signals so to measure the shower total energy.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>Entanglement and Bell Nonlocality in $Ï^+ Ï^-$ at the LHC using Machine Learning for Neutrino Reconstruction</strong>, Yulei Zhang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01496v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01496v1</a></p>

<p>Experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have accumulated an unprecedented amount of data corresponding to a large variety of quantum states. Although searching for new particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics remains a high priority for the LHC program, precision measurements of the physical processes predicted in the Standard Model continue to lead us to a deeper understanding of nature at high energies. We carry out detailed simulations for the process $pp \to \tau^+\tau^- X$ to perform quantum tomography and to measure the quantum entanglement and the Bell nonlocality of the $\tau^+\tau^-$ two qubit state, including both statistical and systematic uncertainties. By using advanced machine learning techniques for neutrino momentum reconstruction, we achieve precise measurements of the full spin density matrix, a critical advantage over previous studies limited by reconstruction challenges for missing momenta. Our analysis reveals a clear observation of Bell nonlocality with high statistical significance, surpassing 5$\sigma$, establishing $\tau^+ \tau^-$ as an ideal system for quantum information studies in high-energy collisions. Given its experimental feasibility and the high expected sensitivity for Bell nonlocality, we propose that $\tau^+ \tau^-$ should be regarded as the new benchmark system for quantum information studies at the LHC, complementing and extending the insights gained from the $t\bar{t}$ system.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>What KM3-230213A events may tell us about the neutrino mass and dark matter</strong>, Basabendu Barman et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01447v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01447v1</a></p>

<p>Within the framework of general $U(1)$ scenario, we demonstrate that the ultra high energy neutrinos recently detected by KM3NeT could originate from a decaying right handed neutrino dark matter (DM), with a mass of 440 PeV. Considering DM production via freeze-in, we delineate the parameter space that satisfies the observed relic abundance and also lies within the reach of multiple gravitational wave detectors. Our study provides a testable new physics scenario, enabled by multi-messenger astronomy.</p>

<p>2025-04-03, <strong>Background-Enhanced Axion Force by Axion Dark Matter</strong>, Yu Cheng et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02702v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.02702v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the influence of axion dark matter as a background on the spin-independent axion forces between nucleons. Notably, we find that the potential for axion forces scales from $1/r^3$ in a vacuum-only context to $1/r$ when the background effect is considered. Also, the magnitude of the axion force is substantially amplified in proportion to the number density of axion DM particles. These enhancements significantly improve the constraints on the axion decay constant by several orders of magnitude, across a broad range of axion masses, based on the fifth-force experiments such as the Casimir-less and torsion balance tests. This suggests that such experiments are more effective than previously understood in detecting axions.</p>

<p>2025-04-03, <strong>The rise and fall of radio-luminous merger shocks from a large sample of galaxy cluster simulations</strong>, SebastiÃ¡n E. Nuza et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02563v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.02563v1</a></p>

<p>The generation of merger shocks is a natural outcome of the hierarchical process of structure formation. As time elapses cosmic structures grow in mass and size via mergers and through the continuous accretion of material onto the potential wells of dark matter haloes. In particular, some dynamically-perturbed galaxy clusters exhibit spectacular non-thermal radio features known as radio relics that are believed to trace cluster merger shocks at different stages of evolution. These radio shocks are thought to be illuminated by the acceleration of cosmic ray electrons in the presence of intracluster magnetic fields. In this contribution, we analyse a large sample of hydrodynamical, cosmological re-simulations of merging galaxy clusters belonging to The Three Hundred Project to study the median evolution of radio relics as a function of cluster mass and redshift. This synthetic cluster merger sample enables us to compute in detail the luminosity output of radio shocks from their onset at core passage to demise.</p>

<p>2025-04-03, <strong>Globular cluster distributions as a dynamical probe of dark matter</strong>, Nativ Ben-Yeda et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02476v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.02476v1</a></p>

<p>Globular clusters (GCs) act as massive probe particles traversing the dark matter halos of their host galaxies. Gravitational dynamical friction due to halo particles causes GC orbits to contract over time, providing a beyond-mean field test of the cold dark matter paradigm. We explore the information content of such systems, using N-body and semianalytic simulations and scanning over a range of initial conditions. We consider data from the ultradiffuse galaxies NGC5846-UDG1 and UDG-DF44, and from the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The GC systems of UDG1 and Fornax indicate the presence of dark matter halos, independent of (but consistent with) stellar kinematics data. UDG-DF44 is too diffuse for dynamical friction to give strong constraints. Our analysis can be extended to many additional galaxies.</p>

<p>2025-04-03, <strong>Revealing the microscopic mechanism of deuteron formation at the LHC</strong>, ALICE Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02393v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.02393v1</a></p>

<p>The formation of light (anti)nuclei with mass number A of a few units (e.g., d, $^3$He, and $^4$He) in high-energy hadronic collisions presents a longstanding mystery in nuclear physics [1,2]. It is not clear how nuclei bound by a few MeV can emerge in environments characterized by temperatures above 100 MeV [3-5], about 100,000 times hotter than the center of the Sun. Despite extensive studies, this question remained unanswered. The ALICE Collaboration now addresses it with a novel approach using deuteron-pion momentum correlations in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our results provide model-independent evidence that about 80% of the observed (anti)deuterons are produced in nuclear fusion reactions [6] following the decay of short-lived resonances, such as the $\Delta (1232)$. These findings resolve a crucial gap in our understanding of nucleosynthesis in hadronic collisions. Beyond answering the fundamental question on how nuclei are formed in hadronic collisions, the results can be employed in the modeling of the production of light and heavy nuclei in cosmic rays [7] and dark matter decays [8,9].</p>

<p>2025-04-03, <strong>Diversifying halo structures in two-component self-interacting dark matter models via mass segregation</strong>, Daneng Yang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02303v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.02303v1</a></p>

<p>Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), through gravothermal evolution driven by elastic self-scatterings, offers a compelling explanation for the observed diversity of inner halo densities. In this work, we investigate SIDM dynamics in a two-component dark matter model with mass ratios of order unity, motivated by an asymmetric dark matter framework that naturally evades constraints from relic abundance and mediator decay, while enabling strong, velocity-dependent self-interactions. We show that cross-component scatterings significantly enhance mass segregation, driving the formation of dense, core collapsed-like halos. This effect couples naturally to SIDM-induced diversity, introducing a new mechanism for generating structural variations beyond those arising from gravothermal evolution alone. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for reconciling SIDM with small-scale observational tensions by enabling shifts in central densities while preserving the flexibility to generate diverse halo structures. We further highlight that halo structural diversity may serve as a diagnostic of dark sector composition, opening a new observational window into the particle nature of SIDM.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>Stellar tidal streams around nearby spiral galaxies with deep imaging from amateur telescopes</strong>, David Martinez-Delgado et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02071v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.02071v1</a></p>

<p>Tidal interactions between massive galaxies and their satellites are fundamental processes in a Universe with L-Cold Dark Matter cosmology, redistributing material into faint features that preserve records of past galactic interactions. While stellar streams in the Local Group impressively demonstrate satellite disruption, they do not constitute a statistically significant sample. Constructing a substantial catalog of stellar streams beyond the Local Group remains challenging due to the difficulties in obtaining deep, wide-field images of galaxies. Despite their potential to illuminate dark matter distribution and galaxy formation processes, stellar streams remain underutilized as cosmological probes. The Stellar Tidal Stream Survey (STSS) addresses this observational gap by leveraging amateur telescopes to obtain deep, scientific-grade images of galactic outskirts, capable of building a more statistically meaningful sample of stellar streams. Over the last decade, the STSS has acquired deep (up to surface brightness limit 28.3 mag/arcsec^2 in the r-band), wide-field images of 15 nearby Milky Way analog galaxies using a network of robotic amateur telescopes, avoiding the issues associated with âmosaicingâ smaller images taken with a professional telescope. Our survey has revealed a diverse range of previously unreported faint features related to dwarf satellite accretion - including stellar streams, shells, and umbrella-like structures. We discover an ultra-diffuse galaxy (NGC150-UDG1), which shows hints of tidal tails. The STSS demonstrates the suitability of modern amateur telescopes to detect and study faint, diffuse structures in large fields around nearby spiral galaxies. Their economic and accessibility advantages enable larger samples with deep imaging, essential for testing galaxy formation models and constraining the properties of minor merger events in the local Universe.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>QUPITER â Space Quantum Sensors for Jovian-Bound Dark Matter</strong>, Yu-Dai Tsai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02039v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.02039v1</a></p>

<p>We propose utilizing space quantum sensors to detect ultralight dark matter (ULDM) bound to planetary bodies, focusing on Jupiter as the heaviest planet in the solar system. Leveraging Jupiterâs deep gravitational potential and the wealth of experience from numerous successful missions, we present strong sensitivity projections on the mass and couplings of scalar ULDM. Future space missions offer unique opportunities to probe the ULDM interactions using quantum sensors, including superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometers. By measuring dark matter-induced magnetic field oscillations, we expect to achieve sensitivity orders of magnitude beyond the terrestrial probes and significantly improve detection prospects of theoretically motivated ULDM candidates.</p>

<p>We present a new framework of grand unification that is equipped with an axion solution to the strong CP problem without a domain wall problem when the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is spontaneously broken after inflation. Our grand unified theory (GUT) is based on a symmetry breaking pattern, $SU(10) \times SU(5)_1 \rightarrow SU(5)_V \supset SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$, where $SU(5)_1$ and a special embedding of $SU(5)_2\subset SU(10)$ are broken to a diagonal subgroup $SU(5)_V$. The model contains a vector-like pair of PQ-charged fermions that transform as (anti-)fundamental representations under $SU(10)$, so that the domain wall number is one. However, after the GUT symmetry breaking, the number of vector-like pairs of PQ-charged colored fermions is larger than one, which seems to encounter the domain wall problem. This apparent inconsistency is resolved by small instanton effects on the axion potential which operate as a PQ-violating bias term and allow the decay of domain walls. We propose a domain-wall-free UV completion for an IR model where the domain wall number appears larger than one. The model gives a prediction for a dark matter axion window, which is different from that of the ordinary post-inflationary QCD axion with domain wall number one.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>Individual halo bias in models of $f(R)$ gravity</strong>, Jorge Enrique GarcÃ­a-Farieta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01958v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01958v1</a></p>

<p>Halo bias links the statistical properties of the spatial distribution of dark matter halos to those of the underlying dark matter field, providing insights into clustering properties in both general relativity (GR) and modified-gravity scenarios such as $f(R)$ models. While the primary halo mass-dependent bias has been studied in detailed, the secondary bias, which accounts for the additional dependencies on other internal halo properties, can offer a sensitive probe for testing gravity beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model. To quantify any potential deviations between $\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$ gravity models in halo clustering, at both the primary and secondary level, as well as in the distributions of halo properties in the cosmic web. Using $N$-body simulations of $f(R)$ gravity models, we assess the scaling relations and the primary and secondary bias signals of halo populations on the basis of a halo-by-halo estimator of large-scale effective bias. Our analysis is performed using halo number density as the independent variable. The relative difference in the effective bias between the $f(R)$ models and $\Lambda$CDM is sensitive, albeit slightly, to the power index of modified gravity. The largest deviations from GR are measured for low-mass halos, where the average bias at fixed number density decreases by up to 5\% for fixed scaling indices. We also show that the scaling relations for some environmental properties, including neighbour statistics, Mach number and local overdensity, exhibit small but non-negligible deviations (~3-5\%) from GR for a wide range of number densities. Our results also suggests that the properties of halos in sheets and voids show the largest departures from GR (&gt; 10\% in some cases). In terms of secondary bias, we do not find any statistically significant deviations with respect to $\Lambda$CDM for any of the properties explored in this work.</p>

<p>The search for dark matter is an exciting topic that is pursued in different communities over a wide range of masses and using a variety of experimental approaches. The result is a strongly correlated matrix of activities across Europe and beyond, both on the experimental and the theoretical side. We suggest to encourage and foster the collaboration of the involved institutions on technical, scientific and organisational level, in order to realise the synergies that are required to increase the impact of dark matter research and to cope with the increasing experiment sizes. The suggested network â loosely titled âDMInfraNetâ â could be realised as a new initiative of the European strategy or be based on existing structures like iDMEu or DRD. The network can also serve as a nucleus for future joint funding proposals.</p>

<p>We study the dynamics of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker models where a dark energy component with a quadratic equation of state (EoS) nonlinearly interacts with cold dark matter. Thus, two energy scales naturally come into play: $\rho_<em>$ is the scale at which the nonlinearity of the EoS becomes relevant; $\rho_i$ is the energy scale around which the interaction starts to play an important role in the dynamics. Our focus is to understand whether there are parameter ranges for this system that can produce non-singular bouncing and emergent cosmologies for any initial condition. We complete a dynamical systems analysis, and find the parameter range such that trajectories always expand from a high energy non-singular de Sitter state. For flat and negative curvature models this de Sitter state is represented by a fixed point, the asymptotic past from which the universe emerges from. We find a subset of positive curvature models that during contraction get arbitrarily close to the de Sitter state, thus having a quasi-de Sitter bounce, then emerge from the bounce and expand, evolving toward spatial flatness. We find that the dimensionless parameter $q\equiv \rho_</em>/\rho_i$, which measures the relative strength of the nonlinear terms in the system, plays a crucial role in the topology of the phase space. When $q &lt; 3$, some trajectories expand toward a singularity, while others evolve toward a low energy cosmological constant at late-times, with a subset going through a decelerated matter dominate era before the final acceleration. When $q &gt; 3$, all trajectories are non-singular, and evolve toward a late-time cosmological constant. We find a subclass in this case in which all trajectories have at least one decelerated matter dominated phase, and accelerate at late-times.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>The CosmoVerse White Paper: Addressing observational tensions in cosmology with systematics and fundamental physics</strong>, Eleonora Di Valentino et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01669v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01669v1</a></p>

<p>The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological description of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and cosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed by a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described by the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution, as well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation through general relativity. There have always been open questions about the soundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have shown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the emergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White Paper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming decade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these challenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the measurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical confidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys. We also discuss the growing set of novel data analysis approaches that go beyond traditional methods to test physical models. [Abridged]</p>

<p>We derive bounds $ |\frac{d\psi(\alpha)}{d\alpha}| \leq 1 $, $ \frac{d(\frac{d\psi(\alpha)}{d\alpha}\psi(\alpha))}{d\alpha} \leq 1 $ on the GL (Gell-MannâLow) function $\psi(\alpha)$ from the Kallen-Lehmann dispersion representation in quantum electrodynamics. We also derive analogous bounds for the GL function in the Wess-Zumino model. The implications of the obtained inequalities are discussed. In particular, we obtain bounds on coupling constants in dark photon model and in dark matter model with vector $(B-L)$ messenger.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>Multi-wavelength properties of $z\gtrsim 6$ LISA detectable events</strong>, Srija Chakraborty et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01327v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01327v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the intrinsic and observational properties of $z\gtrsim 6$ galaxies hosting coalescing massive black holes (MBHs) that gives rise to gravitational waves (GWs) detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We adopt a zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy formation and black hole (BH) co-evolution, zoomed-in on a $M_h \sim 10^{12}~\rm M_{\odot}$ dark matter halo at z = 6, which hosts a fast accreting super-massive black hole (SMBH) and a star-forming galaxy. Following the SMBH formation backward in time, we identify the merging events that concurred to its formation and we pick up the ones that are detectable with LISA. Among these LISA detectable events (LDEs), we select those that, based on their intrinsic properties are expected to be bright in one or more electromagnetic (EM) bands. We post-process these events with dust radiative transfer calculations to make predictions about their spectral energy distributions and continuum maps in the JWST to ALMA wavelength range. We compare the spectra arising from galaxies hosting the merging MBHs with those arising from AGN powered by single accreting BHs. We find that it will be impossible to identify an LDE from the continuum SEDs because of the absence of specific imprints from the merging MBHs. We also compute the profile of the H$_{\rm \alpha}$ line arising from LDEs, considering the contribution from their star-forming regions and the accreting MBHs. We find that the presence of two accreting MBHs would be difficult to infer even if both MBHs accrete at super-Eddington rates. We conclude that the combined detection of GW and EM signals from $z\gtrsim 6$ MBHs is challenging not only because of the poor sky-localization provided by LISA, but also because the loudest GW emitters are not massive enough to leave significant signatures in the emission lines arising from the broad line region.</p>

Isaacs et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02798v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.02798v1</a></p>

<p>We present optical integral-field unit (IFU) spectroscopy acquired with the George and Cynthia Mitchell Spectrograph on the Harlan J. Smith telescope at McDonald Observatory of 94 galaxies (0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.058) that have hosted Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We selected host galaxies with star-forming morphology, consistent with the criteria used by Riess et al. (2022). We measured the H${\alpha}$ surface brightness of each host galaxy within 1 kpc of the location of the supernova. Using distances from the Pantheon+ sample, we find a step in Hubble residuals compared to local H${\alpha}$ surface brightness of -0.097 $\pm$ 0.051 mag at 1.9${\sigma}$ significance in a sample of 73 host galaxies, where SNe in environments with smaller H${\alpha}$ surface brightness are, on average, less luminous after correction for light-curve shape and color. Almost all of the SNe in our sample were discovered by targeted surveys. Using an independent sample primarily from the untargeted Nearby Supernova Factory survey, Rigault et al. (2020) found a step of 0.045 $\pm$ 0.029 mag where SNe in passive environments are instead brighter, which is in 2.4${\sigma}$ tension with our measurement. Rigault et al. (2013) designated SNe Ia comparatively small HRs (&lt; -0.1) and faint local H${\alpha}$ surface brightness (SB) (&lt;log10(H${\alpha}$ SB/(erg$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$kpc$^2$))=38.32 as the M$_2$ population. SNe that would be classified as M$_2$ are less highly represented in our sample (7% versus 21%). When we include an additional twelve early-type galaxies, the number of M$_2$ SNe is almost doubled, although the tension with the HR step measured by Rigault et al. (2020) persists at 1.7${\sigma}$.</p>

<p>In the late progressive stages of heavy stars, electron capture and $\beta^\pm$-decay are the governing processes. The weak rates are essential inputs for modeling the stages of high-mass stars before supernova explosions. As per results obtained from previous simulations, weak rates of Scandium isotopes contribute substantially in changing the lepton-to-baryon ratio ($Y_e$) of the nuclear matter in the core. In the present analysis, we report important $\beta^-$-decay properties of crucial Sc isotopes in an astrophysical environment with mass numbers $49 \leq A \leq 54$. The investigation includes Gamow-Teller (GT) strength distributions, terrestrial half-lives, and stellar rates of electron capture (EC) and $\beta^-$-decay reactions. The calculations are performed using the proton-neutron (pn) quasi-particle random phase approximation (QRPA) model over a wide temperature range ($10^7$-$3 \times 10^{10}$ K) and density range ($10^1 - 10^{11}$ g/cm$^3$). Additionally, we compare our calculated results with available experimental and theoretical data. A good agreement is observed between our calculated half-lives and experimentally measured values. Our weak $\beta^-$-decay and EC rates are compared with those from the Independent-Particle Model (IPM) and Large-Scale Shell Model (LSSM). At high stellar temperatures and densities, our calculated $\beta^-$-decay rates are smaller than those from the other models.</p>

<p>Binary stars are gravitationally bound stellar systems where the evolution of each component can significantly influence the evolution of its companion and the system as a whole. In certain cases, the evolution of these systems can lead to the formation of a red giant-white dwarf system, which may exhibit symbiotic characteristics. The primary goal of this work is to contribute in a statistical way to the estimation of the symbiotic system (SySt) population in the Milky Way and in the dwarf galaxies of the Local Group (LG). Additionally, we aim to infer the maximum contribution of SySt to Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) events. Given the significant discrepancies in previous estimates, we propose two distinct approaches to constrain the expected SySt population: one empirical and another theoretical. These approaches are designed to provide a robust estimation of the SySt population. For the Milky Way, we utilized position and velocity data of known SySts to determine their distribution. Based on these properties, we constrained the lower limit for the Galactic SySt population in the range of 800â4,100. Our theoretical approach, which relies on the properties of zero-age main-sequence binaries and known binary evolutionary paths, suggests a SySt population of $(53\pm6)\times10^3$ SySt in the Galaxy. The statistical SySt populations for LG dwarf galaxies are one to four orders of magnitude lower, primarily dependent on the galaxiesâ bolometric luminosity and, to a lesser extent, their binary fraction and metallicity. In this work, the contribution of the single-degenerate channel of SNe Ia from symbiotic progenitors is estimated to be of the order of 1\% for the Galaxy.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>Are quasars reliable standard candles?</strong>, Elisabeta Lusso et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02040v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.02040v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper we address the question whether the non-linear relation between the X-ray and UV emission of quasars can be used to derive their distances. In previous works of our group, we demonstrated that such a relation does not show any redshift evolution in its slope. The derived distances are in agreement with the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM model up to $z\(\sim$1.5, but they show significant deviations at higher redshifts. Yet, several authors suggested that this discrepancy is due to inconsistencies between the low- and high-redshift sources within the parent sample, or to a redshift evolution of the relation. Here, we discuss these issues through a quantitative comparison with supernova-derived distances in the common redshift range, complemented by simulations showing that all the claimed inconsistencies would naturally arise from any limitation of the cosmological model adopted for the data analysis, that is, from our ignorance of the true cosmology. We argue that the reliability of the method can only be based on a cosmology-independent evaluation of the hypothesis of non-evolution of the X-ray to UV relation at $z$&gt;1.5, subsequent to a careful check of the sample selection and of the flux measurements for possible redshift-dependent systematic effects. Since we do not conceive any physical reason for a sudden change of the normalization of the relation at $z$&gt;1.5, and we can exclude any severe systematic effect in the data selection and flux measurements, we conclude that the application of the X-ray to UV relation to cosmology is well motivated. To further strengthen this point, we need to achieve a better understanding of the physical process behind the observed relation and/or an independent observational proof possibly confirming the discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM found with quasars, such as future supernova measurements at $z\)\sim$2 or higher.</p>

<p>The distance duality relation (DDR) relates two independent ways of measuring cosmological distances, namely the angular diameter distance and the luminosity distance. These can be measured with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), respectively. Here, we use recent DESI DR1, Pantheon+, SH0ES and DES-SN5YR data to test this fundamental relation. We employ a parametrised approach and also use model-independent Generic Algorithms (GA), which are a machine learning method where functions evolve loosely based on biological evolution. When we use DESI and Pantheon+ data without Cepheid calibration or big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), there is a $2\sigma$ violation of the DDR in the parametrised approach. Then, we add high-redshift BBN data and the low-redshift SH0ES Cepheid calibration. This reflects the Hubble tension since both data sets are in tension in the standard cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM. In this case, we find a significant violation of the DDR in the parametrised case at $6\sigma$. Replacing the Pantheon+ SNe Ia data by DES-SN5YR, we find similar results. For the model-independent approach, we find no deviation in the uncalibrated case and a small deviation with BBN and Cepheids which remains at 1$\sigma$. This shows the importance of considering model-independent approaches for the DDR.</p>

<p>This paper outlines the scientific goals and observational strategies of the Mini-SiTian array. Mounted at Xinglong Observatory, the Mini-SiTian array consists of three 30 cm telescopes and has been in operation since 2022. The large field of view, combined with the capability for multi-band photometric observations, enables the Mini-SiTian array to perform rapid follow-up observations to identify optical counterparts of gravitational waves, capture the early light curves of tidal disruption events and supernovae, and monitor stellar flares, Be star outbursts, and cataclysmic variable stars, although its limiting magnitude is not very deep. By collaborating with the Xinglong 2.16-m telescope and leveraging a real-time image processing pipeline, simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations could be performed to reveal their underlying physical mechanisms. The observational and research experience provide critical guidance for the implementation of the full-scale SiTian project in the future.</p>

<p>This paper provides a comprehensive introduction to the Mini-SiTian Real-Time Image Processing pipeline (STRIP) and evaluates its operational performance. The STRIP pipeline is specifically designed for real-time alert triggering and light curve generation for transient sources. By applying the STRIP pipeline to both simulated and real observational data of the Mini-SiTian survey, it successfully identified various types of variable sources, including stellar flares, supernovae, variable stars, and asteroids, while meeting requirements of reduction speed within 5 minutes. For the real observational dataset, the pipeline detected 1 flare event, 127 variable stars, and 14 asteroids from three monitored sky regions. Additionally, two datasets were generated: one, a real-bogus training dataset comprising 218,818 training samples, and the other, a variable star light curve dataset with 421 instances. These datasets will be used to train machine learning algorithms, which are planned for future integration into STRIP.</p>

<p>In various types of supernovae (SNe), strong interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) has been reported. This raises questions on their progenitors and mass-loss processes shortly before the explosion. Recently, the bright long-lived Type~II SN 2021irp was proposed to be a standard Type II SN interacting with disk-like CSM. The observational properties suggest that the progenitor was a massive star in a binary system and underwent a mass-ejection process due to the binary interaction just before the explosion. Here, we study the diversity of the observational properties of bright long-lived Type II (21irp-like) SNe. We analyse the diversity of their CSM properties, in order to understand their progenitors and mass-loss mechanisms and their relations with the other types of interacting SNe. We performed photometry, spectroscopy, and/or polarimetry for four 21irp-like SNe. Based on these observations as well as published data of SN~2021irp itself and well-observed bright and long-lived type II SNe including SNe~2010jl, 2015da and 2017hcc, we discuss their CSM characteristics. This sample of SNe shows luminous and long-lived photometric evolution, with some variations in the photometric evolution (from $\sim-17$ to $\sim-20$ absolute mag in the $r$/$o$ band even at $\sim 200$ days after the explosion). They show photospheric spectra characterized mainly by Balmer lines for several hundreds of days, with some variations in the shapes of the lines. They show high polarization with slight variations in the polarization degrees with rapid declines with time (from $\sim3-6$ \% before the peak to $\sim1$ \% at $\sim200$ days after the peak). The observational properties are consistent with the disk-CSM-interaction scenario, i.e., typical Type~II SNe interacting with disk-like CSM.</p>

<p>2025-04-02, <strong>Producing type Ia supernovae from hybrid CONe white dwarfs with main-sequence binary companions at low metallicity of Z = 0.0001</strong>, Boyang Guo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01412v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.01412v1</a></p>

<p>The nature of progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and their explosion mechanism remain unclear. It has been suggested that SNe Ia may be resulted from thermonuclear explosions of hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon white dwarfs(CONe WDs) when they grow in mass to approach the Chandrasekhar mass limit by accreting matter from a binary main-sequence (MS) companion. In this work, we combine the results of detailed binary evolution calculations with population synthesis models to investigate the rates and delay times of SNe Ia in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001. For a constant star formation rate of 5 M_sun yr-1, our calculations predict that the SN Ia rates in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity of Z = 0.0001 is about 0.11 - 3.89 * 10-4 yr-1. In addition,delay times in this channel cover a wide range of 0.05 - 2.5 Gyr. We further compare our results to those given by previous study for the CONe WD + MS channel with higher metallicity of Z = 0.02 to explore the influence of metallicity on the results. We find that these two metallicity environments give a slight difference in rates and delay times of SNe Ia from the CONe WD + MS channel, although SNe Ia produced at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001 have relatively longer delay times.</p>
