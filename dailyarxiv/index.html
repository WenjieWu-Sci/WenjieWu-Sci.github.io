<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Reconstruction and Performance Evaluation of FASER’s Emulsion Detector at the LHC</strong>, FASER Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13008v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.13008v1</a></p>

<p>This paper presents the reconstruction and performance evaluation of the FASER$\nu$ emulsion detector, which aims to measure interactions from neutrinos produced in the forward direction of proton-proton collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The detector, composed of tungsten plates interleaved with emulsion films, records charged particles with sub-micron precision. A key challenge arises from the extremely high track density environment, reaching $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ tracks per cm$^2$. To address this, dedicated alignment techniques and track reconstruction algorithms have been developed, building on techniques from previous experiments and introducing further optimizations. The performance of the detector is studied by evaluating the single-film efficiency, position and angular resolution, and the impact parameter distribution of reconstructed vertices. The results demonstrate that an alignment precision of 0.3 micrometers and robust track and vertex reconstruction are achieved, enabling accurate neutrino measurements in the TeV energy range.</p>

<p>We demonstrate the prompt-delayed signals induced by knockout neutrons from the quasi-elastic scattering in neutrino experiments provides a new avenue for detecting light dark matter. As an illustration, we consider the detection of atmospheric dark matter in the liquid scintillator detectors. The results show that the constraint on the DM-nucleon interaction from KamLAND is approximately one order of magnitude more stringent than those obtained from the elastic nuclear recoil signals in dark matter direct detection experiments. Furthermore, a larger volume neutrino experiment, such as JUNO, is expected to significantly enhance the light dark matter detection sensitivity through the quasi-elastic scattering.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Lessons from commissioning of the cryogenic system for the Short-Baseline Neutrino Detector at Fermilab</strong>, Frederick Schwartz et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12969v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12969v1</a></p>

<p>Results from commissioning and first year of operations of the cryogenic system of the Short-Baseline Neutrino Detector (SBND) and its membrane cryostat installed at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory are described. The SBND detector is installed in a 200 m$^3$ membrane cryostat filled with liquid argon, which serves both as target and as active media. For the correct operation of the detector, the liquid argon must be kept in very stable thermal conditions while the contamination of electronegative impurities must be consistently kept at the level of small fractions of parts per billion. The detector is operated in Booster Neutrino Beams (BNB) at Fermilab for the search of sterile neutrinos and measurements of neutrino-argon cross sections. The cryostat and the cryogenic systems also serve as prototypes for the much larger equipment to be used for the LBNF/DUNE experiment. Since its installation in 2018-2023 and cooldown in spring of 2024, the cryostat and the cryogenic system have been commissioned to support the detector operations. The lessons learned through installation, testing, commissioning, cooldown, and initial operations are described.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Phenomenology of Inverse Seesaw Using $S_3$ Modular Symmetry</strong>, Mitesh Kumar Behera et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12954v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12954v1</a></p>

<p>Describing neutrino masses using the inverse seesaw mechanism with discrete flavor symmetry imposed through modular forms provides a testable framework at TeV scales with fewer parameters. However, $S_3$, the smallest modular group, remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we construct the minimal supersymmetric inverse seesaw model based on the modular $S_3$ flavor symmetry. In our model, the light neutrino mass matrix depends on 6 real parameters: the complex modulus, an overall scale for light neutrino mass, a real ratio and a complex ratio of Yukawa coupling. Thanks to its minimality, our model offers various definite predictions: the lightest neutrino is massless, the neutrino masses are inverted ordering, the sum of the three light neutrino masses ($\sum_i m_i$) is 100 meV, the effective mass for the end point of the beta decay spectrum is 50 meV, the effective mass for neutrinoless double beta decay ($m_{ee}$) is in the range $38-58$ meV. In particular, the predicted values for $\sum_i m_i$ and $m_{ee}$ from our model are within reach of the next generation experiments. Our model also predicts radiative lepton flavor violating decays $\ell\to\ell’\gamma$ which are compatible with experimental constraints.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Purely gravitational dark matter production in warm inflation</strong>, Qing-Yang Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13147v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.13147v1</a></p>

<p>We consider an appealing scenario for the production of purely gravitational dark matter in the background of warm inflation, a mechanism that maintains stable thermal bath during inflation. Through systematic investigation of various gravitational production channels, we reveal distinctive features compared to the standard inflation scenario. Notably, the inflaton annihilation channel in warm inflation exhibits markedly different thermodynamics from the standard inflation paradigm, leading to a suppression on the production of sub-inflaton-mass dark matter. For the production channel of inflationary vacuum fluctuations, we find a correlation of $\rho_\chi\propto m_\chi^{5/2}$ for the conformally coupled dark matter, which expands the feasible range of dark matter mass. Our results also indicates that a minimum temperature threshold of $10^{-6}M_P$ is necessary for warm inflation, which allows adequate dark matter production. With observational constraints, our results provide stringent limits on the mass range of purely gravitational dark matter with sufficient density: $10^{-8}-10^{-2}M_P$ for minimal coupling and $10^{-14}-10^{-2}M_P$ for conformal coupling.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Absorption of Fermionic Dark Matter in the PICO-60 C$<em>{3}$F$</em>{8}$ Bubble Chamber</strong>, E. Adams et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13089v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.13089v1</a></p>

<p>Fermionic dark matter absorption on nuclear targets via neutral current interactions is explored using a non-relativistic effective field theory framework. An analysis of data from the PICO-60 C$_{3}$F$_{8}$ bubble chamber sets leading constraints on spin-independent absorption for dark matter masses below 23 MeV/$\textit{c}^2$ and establishes the first limits on spin-dependent absorptive interactions. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of bubble chambers to low-mass dark matter and underscore the importance of absorption searches in expanding the parameter space of direct detection experiments.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Euclid preparation. Estimating galaxy physical properties using CatBoost chained regressors with attention</strong>, Euclid Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13020v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.13020v1</a></p>

<p>Euclid will image ~14000 deg^2 of the extragalactic sky at visible and NIR wavelengths, providing a dataset of unprecedented size and richness that will facilitate a multitude of studies into the evolution of galaxies. In the vast majority of cases the main source of information will come from broad-band images and data products thereof. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify or develop scalable yet reliable methodologies to estimate the redshift and physical properties of galaxies using broad-band photometry from Euclid, optionally including ground-based optical photometry also. To address this need, we present a novel method to estimate the redshift, stellar mass, star-formation rate, specific star-formation rate, E(B-V), and age of galaxies, using mock Euclid and ground-based photometry. The main novelty of our property-estimation pipeline is its use of the CatBoost implementation of gradient-boosted regression-trees, together with chained regression and an intelligent, automatic optimization of the training data. The pipeline also includes a computationally-efficient method to estimate prediction uncertainties, and, in the absence of ground-truth labels, provides accurate predictions for metrics of model performance up to z~2. We apply our pipeline to several datasets consisting of mock Euclid broad-band photometry and mock ground-based ugriz photometry, to evaluate the performance of our methodology for estimating the redshift and physical properties of galaxies detected in the Euclid Wide Survey. The quality of our photometric redshift and physical property estimates are highly competitive overall, validating our modeling approach. We find that the inclusion of ground-based optical photometry significantly improves the quality of the property estimation, highlighting the importance of combining Euclid data with ancillary ground-based optical data.

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Calibrating the SIDM Gravothermal Catastrophe with N-body Simulations</strong>, Charlie Mace et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13004v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.13004v1</a></p>

<p>Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) theories predict that dark matter halos experience core-collapse in late-stage evolution, a process where the halo’s inner region rapidly increases in density and decreases in size. This process can be modeled by treating the dark matter as a gravothermal fluid, and solving the fluid equations to predict the density profile evolution. This model is incomplete without calibration to N-body simulations, through a constant factor $\beta$ included in the thermal conductivity for the long-mean-free-path limit. The value of $\beta$ employed in the gravothermal fluid formalism has varied between studies, with no clear universal value in the literature. In this work, we use the N-body code Arepo to conduct a series of isolated core-collapse simulations across a range of scattering cross-sections, halo concentrations, and halo masses to calibrate the heat transfer parameter $\beta$. We find that $\beta$ is independent of cross-section, halo concentration, and halo mass for velocity independent elastic scattering cross-sections. We present a model for an effective $\beta$ as a function of a dimensionless cross-section, to describe halo evolution in the long mean free path limit, and show that it accurately captures halo evolution as long as the cross section is not too large. This effective model facilitates comparisons between simulations and the gravothermal model, and enables fast predictions of the dark matter density profile at any given time without running N-body simulations.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Performance of the advanced gamma-ray trigger system for the High Energy Cosmic Radiation Detection (HERD) facility</strong>, Keerthana Rajan Lathika et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12930v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12930v1</a></p>

<p>The High Energy Cosmic-Radiation Detection (HERD) facility has been proposed as a leading experiment on China’s Space Station (CSS). Scheduled for installation around 2027, HERD is expected to operate for at least a decade. The main scientific objectives include indirect detection of dark matter with unprecedented sensitivity, studying the cosmic-ray spectrum and composition up to the knee, and observing all-sky gamma rays with energies above 100 MeV. HERD is designed as a large-acceptance telescope with a unique design aimed at maximizing its efficiency. It comprises a central 3D imaging calorimeter (CALO) made of LYSO crystals, encircled by four complementary subdetectors on its top and four lateral faces: the scintillating fiber tracking detector (FIT), the plastic scintillator detector (PSD), the silicon charge detector (SCD), and a transition radiation detector (TRD) on one lateral side. To fully harness HERD gamma-ray detection capabilities down to 100 MeV, an advanced ultra-low-energy gamma-ray (ULEG) trigger system has been developed. We present an extensive overview of the design, performance, and optimization of the gamma-ray trigger system supported by software simulations and preliminary results from the successful implementation of the HERD prototype at CERN’s PS and SPS beam test campaigns in Fall 2023.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>A two-component dark matter model with $Z_2 \times Z_4$ symmetry</strong>, XinXin Qi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12876v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12876v1</a></p>

<p>We consider a two-component dark matter model with $Z_2 \times Z_4$ symmetry, where a singlet scalar $S$ and a Majorana fermion $\chi$ are introduced as dark matter candidates. We also introduce another singlet scalar $S_0$ with a non-zero vacuum expectation value to the SM so that the fermion dark matter can obtain mass after spontaneous symmetry breaking. We have a new Higgs boson in the model and in the case of the decoupling limit, the fermion dark matter production is only determined by $S$ and the new Higgs boson. The mass hierarchy of these new particles can make a difference in the reaction rate of dark matter annihilation processes, contributing to different viable parameter spaces for different mass orderings. We randomly scanned the parameter space with six various cases under relic density constraint and found that when $\chi$ is the lightest among the dark sector, $\chi$ production is generated via the so-called forbidden channels. Moreover, we consider the combined limits arising from Higgs invisible decay, dark matter relic density and direct detection constraints. Within the chosen parameter space, direct detection results put the most stringent constraint, and we have a more flexible value for the scalar dark matter mass when the mass of $\chi$ is not smaller than the new Higgs boson mass.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Skewness as a Probe of Gravity: Real and Redshift Space Counts-In-Cells</strong>, Paweł Drozda et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12820v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12820v1</a></p>

<p>We study the counts-in-cells reduced skewness $s_3$ for dark matter, halo, and galaxy distributions in both real and redshift space, using the ELEPHANT ($\textit{Extended LEnsing PHysics with ANalytical ray Tracing}$) suite of $N$-body simulations. We compare General Relativity (GR) with two extended (EG) gravity models: $f(R)$ gravity with chameleon screening and the normal-branch Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) model with Vainshtein screening. We quantify the suppression of $s_3$ by redshift-space distortions (RSD), finding that while small-scale skewness is strongly reduced, the $F5$ model retains a $\sim 4\%$ deviation from GR in galaxy samples, corresponding to a $2\sigma$ significance. We show that the ratio $s_3^{\mathrm{RSD}}/s_3^{\mathrm{real}}$ is approximately independent of the gravity model across tracers and redshifts. Our results demonstrate that real-space predictions can help reliably infer redshift-space skewness in both GR and extended gravity, providing a new tool for testing gravity with current and forthcoming galaxy redshift surveys.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Notes on optimizing a multi-sensor gradient axion-like particle dark matter search</strong>, Daniel Gavilan-Martin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12815v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12815v1</a></p>

<p>Axion-like particles (ALPs) arise from well-motivated extensions to the Standard Model and could account for the dark matter. We discuss the scaling of the sensitivity of a galactic ALP dark matter search with the number of sensors, especially in the ultra-light mass regime, where the measurement time is shorter than the coherence time of the ALP field. We compare multiple schemes for daily modulated ALP gradient signals, and show that increasing the number of sensors from 1 to 2 improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by a factor of 2-3. For more than two sensors, the SNR increases as the square root of the number of sensors. Then, we show that splitting the data into subsets and then averaging its Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) is equivalent to the DFT of the whole dataset in terms of SNR.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Status of the Proton EDM Experiment (pEDM)</strong>, Jim Alexander et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12797v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12797v1</a></p>

<p>The Proton EDM Experiment (pEDM) is the first direct search for the proton electric dipole moment (EDM) with the aim of being the first experiment to probe the Standard Model (SM) prediction of any particle EDM. Phase-I of pEDM will achieve $10^{-29} e\cdot$cm, improving current indirect limits by four orders of magnitude. This will establish a new standard of precision in nucleon EDM searches and offer a unique sensitivity to better understand the Strong CP problem. The experiment is ideally positioned to explore physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), with sensitivity to axionic dark matter via the signal of an oscillating proton EDM and across a wide mass range of BSM models from $\mathcal{O}(1\text{GeV})$ to $\mathcal{O}(10^3\text{TeV})$. Utilizing the frozen-spin technique in a highly symmetric storage ring that leverages existing infrastructure at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), pEDM builds upon the technological foundation and experimental expertise of the highly successful Muon $g\(-\)2$ Experiments. With significant R\&amp;D and prototyping already underway, pEDM is preparing a conceptual design report (CDR) to offer a cost-effective, high-impact path to discovering new sources of CP violation and advancing our understanding of fundamental physics. It will play a vital role in complementing the physics goals of the next-generation collider while simultaneously contributing to sustaining particle physics research and training early career researchers during gaps between major collider operations.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Flat Circular Velocities on a megaparsec scale from the $Λ$CDM model</strong>, Antonino Del Popolo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12662v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12662v1</a></p>

<p>A recent study using weak gravitational lensing reveals that there are some isolated galaxies having almost flat rotation curves at very large distance from the galactic centres. According to the authors of the study this provides a strong challenge the standard cold dark matter model, since the dark haloes are too small to explain their observations, especially for small stellar masses. In this article, we show that improving their model, the virial radius is larger than their estimates. The NFW rotational curve, and especially the pseudo Isothermal one, are in agreement with their flat rotational curves, especially for the larger baryonic mass bins used by the authors.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Observation of the Axion quasiparticle in 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</strong>, Jian-Xiang Qiu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12572v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12572v1</a></p>

<p>In 1978, Wilczek and Weinberg theoretically discovered a new boson-the Axion-which is the coherent oscillation of the $\theta$ field in QCD. Its existence can solve multiple fundamental questions including the strong CP problem of QCD and the dark matter. However, its detection is challenging because it has almost no interaction with existing particles. Similar $\theta$ has been introduced to condensed matter and so far studied as a static, quantized value to characterize topology of materials. But the coherent oscillation of $\theta$ in condensed matter is proposed to lead to new physics directly analogous to the high-energy Axion particle, the dynamical Axion quasiparticle (DAQ). In this paper, we present the direct observation of the DAQ. By combining 2D electronic device with ultrafast pump-probe optics, we manage to measure the magnetoelectric coupling $\theta$ ($\theta\propto\alpha$) of 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with sub-picosecond time-resolution. This allows us to directly observe the DAQ by seeing a coherent oscillation of $\theta$ at ~44 GHz in real time, which is uniquely induced by the out-of-phase antiferromagnetic magnon. Interestingly, in 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, the DAQ arises from the magnon-induced coherent modulation of Berry curvature. Such ultrafast control of quantum wavefunction can be generalized to manipulate Berry curvature and quantum metric of other materials in ultrafast time-scale. Moreover, the DAQ enables novel quantum physics such as Axion polariton and electric control of ultrafast spin polarization, implying applications in unconventional light-matter interaction and coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Beyond condensed matter, the DAQ can serve as a detector of the dark matter Axion particle. We estimate the detection frequency range and sensitivity in the critically-lacking meV regime, contributing to one of the most challenging questions in fundamental physics.</p>

<p>2025-04-17, <strong>Hunting for newborn magnetars: a multi-messenger approach</strong>, Dafne Guetta et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12834v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2504.12834v1</a></p>

<p>We carry out a numerical calculation of magnetar-powered shock break-outs (SBOs) and supernova (SN) light-curves. In particular, we investigate the impact of gravitational wave (GW) emission by the magnetar central engine on its electromagnetic (EM) counterparts in the ULTRASAT band. Our results show that GW emission by the magnetar has only a minor effect on the SBO light-curve. However, we find that SN light-curves can carry a direct signature of GW emission, which becomes more evident at late times (&gt; 20-30 days).~Our results demonstrate that future ULTRASAT observations will provide crucial insights into the magnetar formation process, and unique information for direct searches of long-transient signals with current and future generation GW detectors. In particular, we estimate a rate of multi-messenger (UV+GW) detections of newly formed magnetars $&gt;$ 1 every two years with ULTRASAT and the Einstein Telescope.</p>
