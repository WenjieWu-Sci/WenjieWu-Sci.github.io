<p>2023-09-13, <strong>Real-time Monitoring for the Next Core-Collapse Supernova in JUNO</strong>, Angel Abusleme et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07109v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.07109v1</a></p>

<p>Core-collapse supernova (CCSN) is one of the most energetic astrophysical events in the Universe. The early and prompt detection of neutrinos before (pre-SN) and during the SN burst is a unique opportunity to realize the multi-messenger observation of the CCSN events. In this work, we describe the monitoring concept and present the sensitivity of the system to the pre-SN and SN neutrinos at the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), which is a 20 kton liquid scintillator detector under construction in South China. The real-time monitoring system is designed with both the prompt monitors on the electronic board and online monitors at the data acquisition stage, in order to ensure both the alert speed and alert coverage of progenitor stars. By assuming a false alert rate of 1 per year, this monitoring system can be sensitive to the pre-SN neutrinos up to the distance of about 1.6 (0.9) kpc and SN neutrinos up to about 370 (360) kpc for a progenitor mass of 30$M_{\odot}$ for the case of normal (inverted) mass ordering. The pointing ability of the CCSN is evaluated by using the accumulated event anisotropy of the inverse beta decay interactions from pre-SN or SN neutrinos, which, along with the early alert, can play important roles for the followup multi-messenger observations of the next Galactic or nearby extragalactic CCSN.</p>

<p>2023-09-13, <strong>Anomaly-free dark matter models with one-loop neutrino masses and a gauged U(1) symmetry</strong>, T. de Boer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06920v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06920v1</a></p>

<p>We systematically study and classify scotogenic models with a local U(1) gauge symmetry. These models give rise to radiative neutrino masses and a stable dark matter candidate, but avoid the theoretical problems of global and discrete symmetries. We restrict the dark sector particle content to up to four scalar or fermionic SU(2) singlets, doublets or triplets and use theoretical arguments based on anomaly freedom, Lorentz and gauge symmetry to find all possible charge assignments of these particles. The U(1) symmetry can be broken by a new Higgs boson to a residual discrete symmetry, that still stabilizes the dark matter candidate. We list the particle content and charge assignments of all non-equivalent models. Specific examples in our class of models that have been studied previously in the literature are the U(1)$_D$ scotogenic and singlet-triplet scalar models breaking to $Z_2$. We also briefly discuss the new phenomenological aspects of our model arising from the presence of a new massless dark photon or massive $Z’$ boson as well as the additional Higgs boson.</p>

<p>2023-09-13, <strong>Analytic Solution to Neutrino Oscillation in Constant Matter Density, and Fast Algorithm</strong>, James Page et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06900v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06900v1</a></p>

<p>A recently published method for solving the neutrino evolution equation with constant matter density is further refined and used to lay out a fast and accurate algorithm for computing transition and survival probabilities. In particular, the three examples of $\overline{\nu}_e$ survival, $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ survival and $\overline{\nu}_e$ appearance probabilities are written in terms of mixing angles, mass differences and matter electron density. A program based on this new method is found to be roughly twice as fast as, and in agreement with, the leading GLoBES package. Furthermore, the behaviour of all relevant effective parameters is sketched out in terms of a range of neutrino energies, or matter electron densities. For instance, the $\overline{\nu}_e$ survival probability in constant matter density is found to have no dependence on the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ or the CP-violating phase $\delta_{13}$.</p>

<p>2023-09-13, <strong>Searches for neutrinos in the direction of radio-bright blazars with the ANTARES telescope</strong>, ANTARES Collaboration et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06874v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06874v1</a></p>

<p>Active galaxies, especially blazars, are among the most promising neutrino source candidates. To date, ANTARES searches for these objects considered GeV-TeV $\gamma$-ray bright blazars. Here, a statistically complete radio-bright blazar sample is used as the target for searches of origins of neutrinos collected by the ANTARES neutrino telescope over 13 years of operation. The hypothesis of a neutrino-blazar directional correlation is tested by pair counting and by a complementary likelihood-based approach. The resulting post-trial $p$-value is $3.0\%$ ($2.2\sigma$ in the two-sided convention), possibly indicating a correlation. Additionally, a time-dependent analysis is performed to search for temporal clustering of neutrino candidates as a mean of detecting neutrino flares in blazars. None of the investigated sources alone reaches a significant flare detection level. However, the presence of 18 sources with a pre-trial significance above $3\sigma$ indicates a $p=1.4\%$ ($2.5\sigma$ in the two-sided convention) detection of a time-variable neutrino flux. An \textit{a posteriori} investigation reveals an intriguing temporal coincidence of neutrino, radio, and $\gamma$-ray flares of the J0242+1101 blazar at a $p=0.5\%$ ($2.9\sigma$ in the two-sided convention) level. Altogether, the results presented here suggest a possible connection of neutrino candidates detected by the ANTARES telescope with radio-bright blazars.</p>

<p>2023-09-13, <strong>Spin-flavor precession of Dirac neutrinos in dense matter and its potential in core-collapse supernovae</strong>, Hirokazu Sasaki et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06691v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06691v1</a></p>

<p>We calculate the spin-flavor precession (SFP) of Dirac neutrinos induced by strong magnetic fields and finite neutrino magnetic moments in dense matter. As found in the case of Majorana neutrinos, the SFP of Dirac neutrinos is enhanced by the large magnetic field potential and suppressed by large matter potentials composed of the baryon density and the electron fraction. The SFP is possible irrespective of the large baryon density when the electron fraction is close to 1/3. The diagonal neutrino magnetic moments that are prohibited for Majorana neutrinos enable the spin precession of Dirac neutrinos without any flavor mixing. With supernova hydrodynamics simulation data, we discuss the possibility of the SFP of both Dirac and Majorana neutrinos in core-collapse supernovae. The SFP of Dirac neutrinos occurs at a radius where the electron fraction is 1/3. The required magnetic field of the proto-neutron star for the SFP is a few $10^{14}$G at any explosion time. For the Majorana neutrinos, the required magnetic field fluctuates from $10^{13}$G to $10^{15}$G. Such a fluctuation of the magnetic field is more sensitive to the numerical scheme of the neutrino transport in the supernova simulation.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>Discovering Long-lived Particles at DUNE</strong>, Pilar Coloma et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06492v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06492v1</a></p>

<p>Long-lived particles (LLPs) arise in many theories beyond the Standard Model. These may be copiously produced from meson decays (or through their mixing with the LLP) at neutrino facilities and leave a visible decay signal in nearby neutrino detectors. We compute the expected sensitivity of the DUNE liquid argon (LAr) and gaseous argon (GAr) near detectors (ND) to light LLP decays. In doing so, we determine the expected backgrounds for both detectors, which have been largely overlooked in the literature, taking into account their angular and energy resolution. We show that searches for LLP decays into muon pairs, or into three pions, would be extremely clean. Conversely, decays into two photons would be affected by large backgrounds from neutrino interactions for both near detectors; finally, the reduced signal efficiency for $e^+ e^-$ pairs leads to a reduced sensitivity for ND-LAr. Our results are first presented in a model-independent way, as a function of the mass of the new state and its lifetime. We also provide detailed calculations for several phenomenological models with axion-like particles (coupled to gluons, to electroweak bosons, or to quark currents). Some of our results may also be of interest for other neutrino facilities using a similar detector technology (e.g. MicroBooNE, SBND, ICARUS, or the T2K Near Detector).</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>How Effective is $N_{eff}$ at Discovering Dark Radiation in a Cosmology with Heavy Particle Decay?</strong>, Katarina Bleau et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06482v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06482v1</a></p>

<p>Any light relic which was in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model before it freezes out results in a shift in the effective number of neutrino species, $N_{eff}$. This quantity is being measured with increasing precision, and planned experiments would seemingly rule out light particles beyond the Standard Model, even for rather high temperature light particle freeze out. Here we explore how these bounds are loosened if the energy density of the light particles is diluted with respect to that of Standard Model radiation, which can happen if a heavy particle decays into the Standard Model bath after the light particle freezes out. After calculating how heavy state decays alter $N_{eff}$ for light particles beyond the Standard Model, we focus in particular on the case that the heavy decaying particle is a gravitino, and use current bounds on $N_{eff}$ to place constraints on the gravitino mass and the branching ratio into light particles for different values of the reheating temperature of the Universe.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>Constraining Cosmology With the CMB $\times$ LIM-Nulling Convergence</strong>, Hannah Fronenberg et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06477v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06477v1</a></p>

<p>Lensing reconstruction maps from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide direct observations of the matter distribution of the universe without the use of a biased tracer. Such maps, however, constitute projected observables along the line of sight that are dominated by their low-redshift contributions. To cleanly access high-redshift information, Maniyar et al. showed that a linear combination of lensing maps from both CMB and line intensity mapping (LIM) observations can exactly null the low-redshift contribution to CMB lensing convergence. In this paper we explore the scientific returns of this nulling technique. We show that LIM-nulling estimators can place constraints on standard $\Lambda$CDM plus neutrino mass parameters that are competitive with traditional CMB lensing. Additionally, we demonstrate that as a clean probe of the high-redshift universe, LIM-nulling can be used for model-independent tests of cosmology beyond $\Lambda$CDM and as a probe of the high-redshift matter power spectrum.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>Axion paradigm with color-mediated neutrino masses</strong>, A. Batra et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06473v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06473v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a generalized KSVZ-type axion framework in which colored fermions and scalars act as two-loop Majorana neutrino-mass mediators. The global Peccei-Quinn symmetry under which exotic fermions are charged solves the strong CP problem. Within our general proposal, various setups can be distinguished by probing the axion-to-photon coupling at helioscopes and haloscopes. We also comment on axion dark-matter production in the early Universe.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>Neutrino mass models at $μ$TRISTAN</strong>, P. S. Bhupal Dev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06463v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06463v1</a></p>

<p>We study the prospects of probing neutrino mass models at the newly proposed antimuon collider $\mu$TRISTAN, involving $\mu^+e^-$ scattering at $\sqrt{s}= 346$ GeV and $\mu^+\mu^+$ scattering at $\sqrt{s}= 2$ TeV. We show that $\mu$TRISTAN is uniquely sensitive to leptophilic neutral and doubly-charged scalars naturally occurring in various neutrino mass models, such as Zee, Zee-Babu, cocktail, and type-II seesaw models, over a wide range of mass and coupling values, well beyond the current experimental constraints. It also allows for the possibility to correlate the collider signals with neutrino mixing parameters and charged lepton flavor violating observables.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>Searching for sbottom LSP at the LHC</strong>, Paulina Knees et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06456v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06456v1</a></p>

<p>Assuming that the sbottom is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), we carry out an analysis of the relevant signals expected at the LHC. The discussion is established in the framework of the $\mu\nu$SSM, where the presence of $R$-parity violating couplings involving right-handed neutrinos solves simultaneously the $\mu$-problem and the accommodation of neutrino masses and mixing angles. The sbottoms are pair produced at the LHC, decaying to a lepton and a top quark or a neutrino and a bottom quark. The decays can be prompt or displaced, depending on the regions of the parameter space of the model. We focus the analysis on the right sbottom LSP, since the left sbottom is typically heavier than the left stop because of the D-term contribution. We compare the predictions of this scenario with ATLAS and CMS searches for prompt and long-lived particles. To analyze the parameter space we sample the $\mu\nu$SSM for a right sbottom LSP, paying special attention to reproduce the current experimental data on neutrino and Higgs physics, as well as flavor observables. For displaced (prompt) decays, our results translate into lower limits on the mass of the right sbottom LSP of about $1041$ GeV ($1070$ GeV). The largest possible value found for the decay length is about $3.5$ mm.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>Event-by-Event Direction Reconstruction of Solar Neutrinos in a High Light-Yield Liquid Scintillator</strong>, A. Allega et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06341v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06341v1</a></p>

<p>The direction of individual $^8$B solar neutrinos has been reconstructed using the SNO+ liquid scintillator detector. Prompt, directional Cherenkov light was separated from the slower, isotropic scintillation light using time information, and a maximum likelihood method was used to reconstruct the direction of individual scattered electrons. A clear directional signal was observed, correlated with the solar angle. The observation was aided by a period of low primary fluor concentration that resulted in a slower scintillator decay time. This is the first time that event-by-event direction reconstruction in high light-yield liquid scintillator has been demonstrated in a large-scale detector.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>Identifying multiwavelength counterparts to astrophysical neutrino events</strong>, Atreya Acharyya et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06164v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06164v1</a></p>

<p>High-energy neutrinos originating in astrophysical sources should be accompanied by gamma-rays at production. Depending on the properties of the emission environment and the distance of the source to the Earth, these gamma-rays may be observed directly, or through the detection of lower energy photons that result from interactions with the intervening radiation fields. In this work, we present an automated tool that aims at using data from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope to identify multiwavelength counterparts to astrophysical neutrino events. The main goal of this tool is to enable prompt follow-up observations with ground-based and space-based observatories in order to help pinpoint the neutrino source.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>Neutrinos and Heavy Element Nucleosynthesis</strong>, Xilu Wang et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06043v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06043v1</a></p>

<p>This chapter discusses three nucleosynthesis processes involved in producing heavy nuclei beyond the iron group that are influenced or shaped by neutrino interactions: the v process, the vp process and the r process. These processes are all related to explosive events involving compact objects, such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, where an abundant amount of neutrinos are emitted. The interactions of the neutrinos with nucleons and nuclei through both charged-current and neutral-current reactions play a crucial role in the nucleosynthesis processes. During the propagation of neutrinos inside the nucleosynthesis sites, neutrinos may undergo flavor oscillations that can also potentially affect the nucleosynthesis yields. Here we provide a general overview of the possible effects of neutrinos and neutrino flavor conversions on these three heavy-element nucleosynthesis processes.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>Environmental radon control in the 700-m underground laboratory at JUNO</strong>, Chenyang Cui et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06039v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06039v1</a></p>

<p>The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory is building the world’s largest liquid scintillator detector with a 20 kt target mass and about 700 m overburden. The total underground space of civil construction is about 300,000 m$^3$ with the main hall volume of about 120,000 m$^3$, which is the biggest laboratory in the world. Radon concentration in the underground air is quite important for not only human beings’ health but also the background of experiments with rare decay detection, such as neutrino and dark matter experiments. The radon concentration is the main hall is required to be around 100 Bq/m$^3$. Optimization of the ventilation with fresh air is effective to control the radon underground. To find the radon sources in the underground laboratory, we made a benchmark experiment in the refuge room near the main hall. The result shows that the radon emanating from underground water is one of the main radon sources in the underground air. The total underground ventilation rate is about 160,000 m$^3$/h fresh air with about 30 Bq/m$^3$ $^{222}$Rn from the bottom of the vertical tunnel after optimization, and 55,000 m$^3$/h is used for the ventilation in the main hall. Finally, the radon concentration inside the main hall decreased from 1600 Bq/m$^3$ to around 100 Bq/m$^3$. The suggested strategies for controlling radon concentration in the underground air are described in this paper.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>Waveform Reconstruction of Core-Collapse Supernovae Gravitational-Waves with Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition</strong>, Yong Yuan et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06011v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06011v1</a></p>

<p>The gravitational waves (GW) from core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) have been proposed as a probe to investigate physical properties inside of the supernova. However, how to search and extract the GW signals from core-collapse supernovae remains an open question due to its complicated time-frequency structure. In this paper, we applied the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method to decompose and reconstruct simulated GW data generated by magnetorotational mechanism and neutrino-driven mechanism within the advanced LIGO, using the match score as the criterion for assessing the quality of the reconstruction. The results indicate that by decomposing the data, the sum of the first six intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) can be used as the reconstructed waveform. To determine the probability that our reconstructed waveform corresponds to a real GW waveform, we calculated the false alarm probability of reconstruction (FAPR). By setting the threshold of the match score to be 0.75, we obtained FAPR of GW sources at a distance of 5 kpc and 10 kpc to be $1\times10^{-2}$ and $3\times10^{-2}$ respectively. If we normalize the maximum amplitude of the GW signal to $5\times10^{-21}$, the FAPR at this threshold is $4\times10^{-3}$. Furthermore, in our study, the reconstruction distance is not equivalent to the detection distance. When the strain of GW reaches $7 \times 10^{-21}$, and the match score threshold is set at 0.75, we can reconstruct GW waveform up to approximately 37 kpc.</p>

<p>The Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment was designed with the primary goal of precisely measuring the neutrino mixing parameter, $\theta_{13}$. Eight identically-designed gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator detectors installed in three underground experimental halls measure the reactor antineutrinos from six nuclear reactors at different distances. Until its shutdown at the end of 2020, Daya Bay experiment has acquired nearly 6 million inverse beta decay candidates with neutron captured on gadolinium. In this talk, the latest neutrino oscillation analysis results based on full data will be presented. The resulting oscillation parameters are $\sin^{2}2\theta_{13}$ = 0.0851 $\pm$ 0.0024, $\Delta m^{2}_{32}$ = (2.466 $\pm$ 0.060) $\times$ $10^{-3}$ ${\rm eV}^{2}$ for the normal mass ordering or $\Delta m^{2}_{32}$ = -(2.571 $\pm$ 0.060) $\times$ $10^{-3}$ ${\rm eV}^{2}$ for the inverted mass ordering, which are the most precise measurement of $\theta_{13}$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{32}$ so far. Moreover, latest results on other topics such as the search of high energy reactor neutrino is included as well.</p>

<p>2023-09-13, <strong>A full reconstruction of two galaxy clusters intra-cluster medium with strong gravitational lensing</strong>, Joseph F. V. Allingham et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07076v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.07076v1</a></p>

<p>Whilst X-rays and Sunyaev-Zel’dovich observations allow to study the properties of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, their gravitational potential may be constrained using strong gravitational lensing. Although being physically related, these two components are often described with different physical models. Here, we present a unified technique to derive the ICM properties from strong lensing for clusters in hydrostatic equilibrium. In order to derive this model, we present a new universal and self-similar polytropic temperature profile, which we fit using the X-COP sample of clusters. We subsequently derive an analytical model for the electron density, which we apply to strong lensing clusters MACS J0242.5-2132 and MACS J0949.8+1708. We confront the inferred ICM reconstructions to XMM-Newton and ACT observations. We contrast our analytical electron density reconstructions with the best canonical $\beta$-model. The ICM reconstructions obtained prove to be compatible with observations. However they appear to be very sensitive to various dark matter halo parameters constrained through strong lensing (such as the core radius), and to the halo scale radius (fixed in the lensing optimisations). With respect to the important baryonic effects, we make the sensitivity on the scale radius of the reconstruction an asset, and use the inferred potential to constrain the dark matter density profile using ICM observations. The technique here developed should allow to take a new, and more holistic path to constrain the content of galaxy clusters.</p>

<p>The axion is a hypothetical elementary particle that could solve the long-standing strong CP problem in particle physics and the dark matter mystery in the cosmos. Due to the stimulation of the ambient photons, the axion dark matter decay into photons is significantly enhanced so that its echo signal could be detected by terrestrial telescopes. As a pathfinder, we study the expected sensitivity of searching for the axion dark matter in the mass range between $0.41$ and $1.6\mu\text{eV}$ with the 21 CentiMeter Array (21CMA). We aim to cover the whole 21CMA frequency range in two years by using a 1MW emitter. We find that the resulting sensitivity on the axion-photon coupling could surpass other existing limits by about one order of magnitude.</p>

<p>We present the predictions with standard sirens at Gravitational Waves detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and the Einstein Telescope (ET), for interacting dark energy theories. We focus on four models characterised by couplings between the dark energy field and the dark matter fluid arising from conformal or disformal transformations of the metric, along with an exponential self-interacting potential. To this purpose we construct mock catalogues and perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis by considering ET and LISA standard sirens, and also their combination with Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Supernovae Ia (SNIa) data. We find that in all the four models considered, the accuracy on the $H_0$ parameter increases by one order of magnitude at 1$\sigma$ when compared to the SNIa+BAO data set, possibly shedding light in the future on the origin of the $H_0$-tension. The combination of standard sirens with SNIa+BAO allows to improve the accuracy on some coupling and exponential parameters, hinting at future prospects for constraining interactions in the dark sector.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>Primordial Black Hole versus Inflaton: Two Chief Systems of the World</strong>, Md Riajul Haque et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06505v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06505v1</a></p>

<p>We compare the dark matter(DM) production processes and its parameters space in the background of reheating obtained from two chief systems in the early Universe: the inflaton $\phi$ and the primordial black holes (PBHs). We concentrated on the mechanism where DMs are universally produced only from the PBH decay and the generation of the standard model plasma from both inflton and PBHs. Whereas the distribution of Primordial Black Holes behaves like dust, the inflaton phenomenology depends strongly on its equation of state after the inflationary phase, which in turn is conditioned by the nature of the potential $V(\phi)$. Depending upon the initial mass and population of PBHs, a large range of DM mass is shown to be viable if reheating is controlled by PBHs itself. Inflaton-dominated reheating is observed to further widen such possibilities depending on the initial population of black holes and its mass as well as the coupling of the inflaton to the standard model sector.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>Secondary accretion of dark matter in intermediate mass-ratio inspirals: Dark-matter dynamics and gravitational-wave phase</strong>, David A. Nichols et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06498v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06498v1</a></p>

<p>When particle dark matter is bound gravitationally around a massive black hole in sufficiently high densities, the dark matter will affect the rate of inspiral of a secondary compact object that forms a binary with the massive black hole. In this paper, we revisit previous estimates of the impact of dark-matter accretion by black-hole secondaries on the emitted gravitational waves. We identify a region of parameter space of binaries for which estimates of the accretion were too large (specifically, because the dark-matter distribution was assumed to be unchanging throughout the process, and the secondary black hole accreted more mass in dark matter than that enclosed within the orbit of the secondary). To restore consistency in these scenarios, we propose and implement a method to remove dark-matter particles from the distribution function when they are accreted by the secondary. This new feedback procedure then satisfies mass conservation, and when evolved with physically reasonable initial data, the mass accreted by the secondary no longer exceeds the mass enclosed within its orbital radius. Comparing the simulations with accretion feedback to those without this feedback, including feedback leads to a smaller gravitational-wave dephasing from binaries in which only the effects of dynamical friction are being modeled. Nevertheless, the dephasing can be hundreds to almost a thousand gravitational-wave cycles, an amount that should allow the effects of accretion to be inferred from gravitational-wave measurements of these systems.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>The contribution of massive haloes to the matter power spectrum in the presence of AGN feedback</strong>, M. L. van Loon et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06479v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06479v1</a></p>

<p>The clustering of matter, as measured by the matter power spectrum, informs us about dark matter and cosmology, as well as baryonic effects on the distribution of matter in the universe. Using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the cosmo-OWLS and BAHAMAS simulation projects, we investigate the contribution of power in haloes with various masses, defined by particles within some overdensity region, to the full power spectrum, as well as the power ratio between baryonic and dark matter only (DMO) simulations for a matched (between simulations) and an unmatched set of haloes. We find that the presence of AGN feedback suppresses the power on all scales for haloes of all masses examined ($10^{11.25}\leq M_{500,\mathrm{crit}}\leq 10^{14.75}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}/h$), by ejecting matter from within $r_{500,\mathrm{c}}$ to $r_{200,\mathrm{m}}$ and potentially beyond in massive haloes ($M_{500,\mathrm{crit}}\gtrsim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}/h$), and likely impeding the growth of lower-mass haloes as a consequence. A lower AGN feedback temperature drastically changes the behaviour of high-mass haloes ($M_{500,\mathrm{crit}}\geq 10^{13.25}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}/h$), damping the effects of AGN feedback at small scales, $k\,\gtrsim\,4\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$. For $k\,\lesssim\,3\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$, group-sized haloes ($10^{14\pm0.25}\, \mathrm{M_\odot}/h$) dominate the power spectrum, while on smaller scales the combined contributions of lower-mass haloes to the full power spectrum rise above that of the group-sized haloes. Finally, we present a model for the power suppression due to feedback, which combines observed mean halo baryon fractions with halo mass fractions and halo-matter cross-spectra extracted from dark matter only simulations to predict the power suppression to percent-level accuracy down to $k\,\approx\,10\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$ without any free parameters.</p>

<p>Despite the Milky Way’s proximity to us, our knowledge of its dark matter halo is fairly limited, and there is still considerable uncertainty in its halo mass. Many past techniques have been limited by assumptions such as the Galaxy being in dynamical equilibrium as well as nearby galaxies being true satellites of the Galaxy, and/or the need to find large samples of Milky Way analogs in simulations.Here, we propose a new technique based on neural networks that obtains high precision ($&lt;0.14$ dex mass uncertainty) without assuming halo dynamical equilibrium or that neighboring galaxies are all satellites, and which can use information from a wide variety of simulated halos (even those dissimilar to the Milky Way) to improve its performance. This method uses only observable information including satellite orbits, distances to nearby larger halos, and the maximum circular velocity of the largest satellite galaxy. In this paper, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept method on simulated dark matter halos; in future papers in this series, we will apply neural networks to estimate the masses of the Milky Way’s and M31’s dark matter halos, and we will train variations of these networks to estimate other halo properties including concentration, assembly history, and spin axis.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>The integrated galaxy-wide stellar initial mass function over the radial acceleration range of early-type galaxies</strong>, Jörg Dabringhausen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06466v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06466v1</a></p>

<p>The observed radial accelerations of 462 Early-type galaxies (ETGs) at their half-mass radii are discussed. They are compared to the baryonic masses of the same galaxies, which are derived from theoretical expectations for their stellar populations and cover a range from $\approx 10^4 \, {\rm M}_{\odot}$ to $\approx 10^{11} \, {\rm M}_{\odot}$. Both quantities are plotted against each other, and it is tested whether they lie (within errors) along theoretical radial acceleration relations (RARs). We choose the Newtonian RAR and two Milgromian, or MONDian RARs. At low radial accelerations (corresponding to low masses), the Newtonian RAR fails without non-baryonic dark matter, but the two MONDian ones may work, provided moderate out-of-equilibrium dynamics in some of the low-mass ETGs. However all three RARs fail at high accelerations (corresponding to high masses) if all ETGs have formed their stellar populations with the canonical stellar initial mass function (IMF). A much better agreement with the observations can however be accomplished, if the theory of the integrated galaxy-wide stellar initial mass functions (IGIMFs) is used instead. This is because the IGIMF-theory predicts the formation of an overabundance of stellar remnants during the lifetime of the massive ETGs. Thus their baryonic masses today are higher than they would be if the ETGs had formed with a canonical IMF. Also the masses of the stellar-mass black holes should be rather high, which would mean that most of them probably formed when the massive ETGs were not as metal-enriched as they are today. The IGIMF-approach confirms downsizing.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>Dynamical system analysis of cosmological evolution in the Aether scalar tensor theory</strong>, João Luís Rosa et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06232v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06232v1</a></p>

<p>The Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) theory is an extension of General Relativity (GR), proposed for addressing galactic and cosmological observations without dark matter.The action for the theory includes a function that can currently only be constrained by phenomenological considerations. In antecedent work, forms of this function were considered that led to an effective fluid contribution to the cosmological evolution equations that approximated that of dust more and more closely at late cosmic times. In this work we consider an alternative set of functions that most closely approximate dust at the earliest cosmic times and where deviations from dust-like behaviour gradually emerge with time. We use the dynamical system formalism to analyze example models from both possible sets of functions, introducing a complete set of dynamical variables describing the spacetime curvature, energy density parameters of different matter components, and AeST scalar field, and obtain the dynamical equations describing cosmological evolution. The cosmological phase space is found to feature invariant submanifolds associated to the absence of the matter components, as well as equilibrium states associated with well-known cosmological behaviors e.g. matter, radiation, and cosmological constant dominated epochs. A full numerical integration of the dynamical system is performed for the models and it is shown that each can closely approximate the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model at the level of the cosmic background. Generalizations of the models are considered and it is shown that the new models likely can simultaneously replicate the cosmological successes of cold dark matter whilst satisfying constraints on the theory from the weak-field quasistatic regime.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>Constraints on the annihilation of heavy dark matter in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with gamma-ray observations</strong>, Xiao-Song Hu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06151v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06151v1</a></p>

<p>Electrons and positrons produced in dark matter annihilation can generate secondary emission through synchrotron and IC processes, and such secondary emission provides a possible means to detect DM particles with masses beyond the detector’s energy band. The secondary emission of heavy dark matter (HDM) particles in the TeV-PeV mass range lies within the Fermi-LAT energy band. In this paper, we utilize the Fermi-LAT observations of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies to search for annihilation signals of HDM particles. We consider the propagation of $e^+/e^-$ produced by DM annihilation within the dSphs, derive the electron spectrum of the equilibrium state by solving the propagation equation, and then compute the gamma-ray signals produced by the $e^+/e^-$ population through the IC and synchrotron processes. We do not detect any significant HDM signal. By assuming a magnetic field strength of $B=1\,{\rm \mu G}$ and a diffusion coefficient of $D_0 = 3\times10^{28}\,{\rm cm^{2}s^{-1}}$ of the dSphs, we place limits on the annihilation cross section for HDM particles. Our results are weaker than the previous limits given by the VERITAS observations of dSphs, but are comparable to those derived from the IceCube observations of dSphs. As a complement, we also search for the prompt $\gamma$-rays produced by DM annihilation and give limits on the cross section in the 10-$10^5$ GeV mass range. Consequently, in this paper we obtain the upper limits on the DM annihilation cross section for a very wide mass range from 10 GeV to 100 PeV in a unified framework of the Fermi-LAT data analysis.</p>

<p>Various studies have shown that the late acceleration of the universe can be caused by the bulk viscosity associated with dark matter. But recently, it was indicated that a cosmological constant is essential for maintaining Near Equilibrium Conditions (NEC) for the bulk viscous matter during the accelerated expansion of the universe. In the present study, we investigate a model of the universe composed of mixed dark matter components, viscous dark matter (vDM), and inviscid cold dark matter (CDM), in the context of $f(R, T)$ gravity and show that the model predicts late acceleration by satisfying NEC throughout the evolution, without a cosmological constant. We have compared the model predictions with the observational data on Hubble parameter and Type Ia Supernovae.</p>

<p>We present the Keck Infrared Transient Survey (KITS), a NASA Key Strategic Mission Support program to obtain near-infrared (NIR) spectra of astrophysical transients of all types, and its first data release, consisting of 105 NIR spectra of 50 transients. Such a data set is essential as we enter a new era of IR astronomy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman). NIR spectral templates will be essential to search JWST images for stellar explosions of the first stars and to plan an effective Roma} SN Ia cosmology survey, both key science objectives for mission success. Between 2022 February and 2023 July, we systematically obtained 274 NIR spectra of 146 astronomical transients, representing a significant increase in the number of available NIR spectra in the literature. The first data release includes data from the 2022A semester. We systematically observed three samples: a flux-limited sample that includes all transients $&lt;$17 mag in a red optical band (usually ZTF r or ATLAS o bands); a volume-limited sample including all transients within redshift $z &lt; 0.01$ ($D \approx 50$ Mpc); and an SN Ia sample targeting objects at phases and light-curve parameters that had scant existing NIR data in the literature. The flux-limited sample is 39% complete (60% excluding SNe Ia), while the volume-limited sample is 54% complete and is 79% complete to $z = 0.005$. All completeness numbers will rise with the inclusion of data from other telescopes in future data releases. Transient classes observed include common Type Ia and core-collapse supernovae, tidal disruption events (TDEs), luminous red novae, and the newly categorized hydrogen-free/helium-poor interacting Type Icn supernovae. We describe our observing procedures and data reduction using Pypeit, which requires minimal human interaction to ensure reproducibility.</p>

<p>2023-09-13, <strong>When and how does ram pressure stripping in low-mass satellite galaxies enhance star formation</strong>, Jingyao Zhu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07037v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.07037v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate how a satellite’s star formation rate (SFR) and surviving gas respond to ram pressure stripping in various environments. Using a suite of high-resolution “wind-tunnel” simulations with radiative cooling, star formation, and supernovae feedback, we model the first infall orbit of a low-mass disk galaxy ($M_{*} = 10^{9.7} M_{\odot}$) in different host halos, ranging from Milky Way-like to cluster hosts. When the ram pressure is moderate, we find that the stripping satellite shows an enhanced SFR relative to the isolated control case, despite gas loss due to stripping. The SFR enhancement is caused, not directly by compression, but by ram pressure-driven mass flows, which can increase the dense gas fraction in the central disk regions. The spatially-resolved star formation main sequence and Kennicutt-Schmidt relations in our simulations are consistent with recent findings of the VERTICO and GASP surveys. Our results predict the environmental signals of RPS in future multiwavelength, high-angular resolution observations: the star formation and gas surface densities will be centralized, and symmetrically enhanced within the stripping radius.</p>

<p>The youngest known Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G1.9+0.3 has high-velocity supernova shock beyond 10000 km s-1, and it is considered to be one of the major candidates of a PeVatron. Despite these outstanding properties, the surrounding interstellar matter of this object is poorly understood. We investigated the interstellar gas toward G1.9+0.3 using the 12CO(J=3-2) data with the angular resolution of 15” obtained by the CHIMPS2 survey by the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, and discovered three individual clouds at -1, 7, and 45 km s-1. From its morphological and velocity structures, the -1 km s-1 cloud, having the largest velocity width &gt;20 km s-1 and located at the distance of the Galactic Center, is possibly associated with the SNR. The associated cloud shows a cavity structure both in space and velocity and coincides well with the SNR. We found that the associated cloud has higher column densities toward three bright, radio synchrotron-emitted rims where the radial expansion velocity of the supernova shock is decelerated, and the cloud is faint in the other parts of the SNR. This is the first direct evidence indicating that the highly anisotropic expansion of G1.9+0.3 observed by previous studies results from the deceleration by the interaction between the supernova shock and surrounding dense interstellar medium.</p>

<p>We present the predictions with standard sirens at Gravitational Waves detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and the Einstein Telescope (ET), for interacting dark energy theories. We focus on four models characterised by couplings between the dark energy field and the dark matter fluid arising from conformal or disformal transformations of the metric, along with an exponential self-interacting potential. To this purpose we construct mock catalogues and perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis by considering ET and LISA standard sirens, and also their combination with Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Supernovae Ia (SNIa) data. We find that in all the four models considered, the accuracy on the $H_0$ parameter increases by one order of magnitude at 1$\sigma$ when compared to the SNIa+BAO data set, possibly shedding light in the future on the origin of the $H_0$-tension. The combination of standard sirens with SNIa+BAO allows to improve the accuracy on some coupling and exponential parameters, hinting at future prospects for constraining interactions in the dark sector.</p>

<p>We present JWST/NIRSpec R$\approx$2700 spectra of four high-redshift quasars: VDES J0020-3653 (z = 6.860), DELS J0411-0907(z = 6.825), UHS J0439+1634 (z = 6.519) and ULAS J1342+0928 (z = 7.535). The exquisite data quality, signal-to-noise ratio of 50-200, and large $0.86!~\mu{\rm m}\le \lambda \le 5.5!~\mu{\rm m}$ spectral coverage allows us to identify between 13 and 17 intervening and proximate metal absorption line systems in each quasar spectrum, with a total number of 61 absorption-line systems detected at $2.42&lt;z&lt;7.48$ including the highest redshift intervening OI $\lambda$1302 and MgII systems at $z=7.37$ and $z=7.44$. We investigate the evolution of the metal enrichment in the epoch of reionization at $z&gt;6$ and find: i) A continued increase of the low-ionization OI, CII, and SiII incidence, ii) Decreasing high-ionization CIV and SiIV incidence with a transition from predominantly high- to low-ionization at $z\approx6.0$, and iii) a constant MgII incidence across all redshifts. The observations support a change in the ionization state of the intergalactic medium in the EoR rather than a change in metallicity. The abundance ratio of [Si/O] in five $z&gt;6$ absorption systems show enrichment signatures produced by low-mass Pop III pair instability supernovae, and possibly Pop III hypernovae. In the Gunn-Peterson troughs we detect transmission spikes where Ly$\alpha$ photons can escape. From 22 absorption systems at $z&gt;5.7$, only a single low-ionization system out of 13 lies within 2000 km s$^{-1}$ from a spike, while four high-ionization systems out of nine lie within $\sim$2000 km s$^{-1}$ from a spike. This confirms that galaxies responsible for the heavy elements that are transported into the circumgalactic medium lie in predominantly in high-density, neutral environments, while lower density environments are ionized without being polluted by metals at $z\approx$ 6-7.

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>Quasi-stationary tidal evolution with arbitrarily misaligned orbital and stellar angular momenta with a preliminary numerical investigation in the non-dissipative limit</strong>, Pavel Ivanov et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06366v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06366v1</a></p>

<p>(Abbreviated) We extend the results of our 2021 paper concerning the problem of tidal evolution of a binary system with a rotating primary component with rotation axis arbitrarily inclined with respect to the orbital plane. Only the contribution of quasi-stationary tides is discussed. Unlike previous studies in this field we present evolution equations derived ‘from first principles’. The governing equations contain two groups of terms.   The first group of terms determines the evolution of orbital parameters and inclination angles a ‘viscous’ time scale. The second group of terms is due to stellar rotation. These terms are present even when dissipation in the star is neglected. Unlike in our 2021 paper we consider all potentially important sources of apsidal precession in an isolated binary, namely precession arising from the tidal distortion and rotation of the primary as well as Einstein precession. We solve these equations numerically for a sample of input parameters, leaving a complete analysis to an accompanying paper. Periodic changes to both the inclination of the rotational axis and its precession rate are found. For a particular binary parameters periodic flips between prograde and retrograde rotation are possible. Also, when the inclination angle is allowed to vary, libration of the apsidal angle becomes possible. Furthermore, when the spin angular momentum is larger than the orbital angular momentum there is a possibility of a significant periodic eccentricity changes.   These phenomena could, in principle, be observed in systems with relatively large inclinations and eccentricities such as e.g. those containing a compact object. In such systems both large inclinations and eccentricities could be generated as a result of a kick applied to the compact object during a supernova explosion.</p>

<p>In this study, we investigate a recent finding based on strong lensing observations, which suggests that the sub-halos observed in clusters exhibit greater compactness compared to those predicted by $\Lambda$CDM simulations. To address this discrepancy, we performed a comparative analysis by comparing the cumulative mass function of sub-halos and the $M_{\text{sub}}$-$V_{\text{circ}}$ relation between observed clusters and 324 simulated clusters from The Three Hundred project, focusing on re-simulations using GADGET-X and GIZMO-SIMBA baryonic models. The sub-halos’ cumulative mass function of the GIZMO-SIMBA simulated clusters agrees with observations, while the GADGET-X simulations exhibit discrepancies in the lower sub-halo mass range possibly due to its strong SuperNova feedback. Both GADGET-X and GIZMO-SIMBA simulations demonstrate a redshift evolution of the sub-halo mass function and the $V_{max}$ function, with slightly fewer sub-halos observed at lower redshifts. Neither the GADGET-X nor GIZMO-SIMBA(albeit a little closer) simulated clusters’ predictions for the $M_{\text{sub}}$-$V_{\text{circ}}$ relation align with the observational result. Further investigations on the correlation between sub-halo/halo properties and the discrepancy in the $M_{\text{sub}}$-$V_{\text{circ}}$ relation reveals that the sub-halo’s half mass radius and galaxy stellar age, the baryon fraction and sub-halo distance from the cluster’s centre, as well as the halo relaxation state play important roles on this relation. Nevertheless, we think it is still challenging in accurately reproducing the observed $M_{\text{sub}}$-$V_{\text{circ}}$ relation in our current hydrodynamic cluster simulation under the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>Bulk viscous late acceleration under near equilibrium conditions in f(R, T) gravity with mixed matter</strong>, Vishnu A Pai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06093v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.06093v1</a></p>

<p>Various studies have shown that the late acceleration of the universe can be caused by the bulk viscosity associated with dark matter. But recently, it was indicated that a cosmological constant is essential for maintaining Near Equilibrium Conditions (NEC) for the bulk viscous matter during the accelerated expansion of the universe. In the present study, we investigate a model of the universe composed of mixed dark matter components, viscous dark matter (vDM), and inviscid cold dark matter (CDM), in the context of $f(R, T)$ gravity and show that the model predicts late acceleration by satisfying NEC throughout the evolution, without a cosmological constant. We have compared the model predictions with the observational data on Hubble parameter and Type Ia Supernovae.</p>

<p>2023-09-12, <strong>Detection of the extended $γ$-ray emission around supernova remnant DA 530 with Fermi-LAT</strong>, Yuliang Xin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05949v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2309.05949v1</a></p>

<p>We report the extended GeV $\gamma$-ray emission around the high Galactic latitude supernova remnant (SNR) DA 530 with the PASS 8 data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT). The $\gamma$-ray spectrum in the energy range of 100 MeV - 1 TeV follows a power law model with an index of 2.23. The much more extended $\gamma$-ray emission than the radio shell of DA 530 and the spatial coincidence with the molecular cloud suggest that the $\gamma$-ray emission could be originated from the hadronic process, where the high energy protons are accelerated in and escaped from the shock of DA 530. With a steady-state injection model of protons, the $\gamma$-ray spectrum can be well fitted with the typical Galactic value for diffusion coefficient and the low energy content of the total escaped protons.</p>
