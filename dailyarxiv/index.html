<p>2025-07-22, <strong>Scalar-induced Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay in $SU(5)$</strong>, P. S. Bhupal Dev et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16606v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.16606v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the role of heavy scalar fields in mediating neutrinoless double beta decay $(0\nu\beta\beta)$ within the $SU(5)$ Grand Unified Theory framework, extended suitably to include neutrino mass. In such a minimal realistic $SU(5)$ setup for fermion masses, the scalar contributions to $0\nu\beta\beta$ are extremely suppressed as a consequence of the proton decay bound. We circumvent this problem by imposing a discrete ${\cal Z}_3$ symmetry. However, the scalar contributions to $0\nu\beta\beta$ remain suppressed in this $SU(5) \times {\cal Z}_3$ model due to the neutrino mass constraint. We find that the $0\nu\beta\beta$ contribution can be enhanced by extending the scalar sector with an additional $\mathbf{15}$-dimensional scalar representation with suitable ${\cal Z}_3$ charge. Such an extension not only yields realistic fermion mass spectra but also leads to experimentally testable predictions in upcoming ton-scale $0\nu\beta\beta$ searches, which can be used as a sensitive probe of the new scalars across a broad range, from LHC-accessible scales up to $\sim 10^{10}\,\text{GeV}$.</p>

<p>2025-07-22, <strong>Cosmological Preference for a Positive Neutrino Mass at 2.7$σ$: A Joint Analysis of DESI DR2, DESY5, and DESY1 Data</strong>, Guo-Hong Du et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16589v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.16589v1</a></p>

<p>Neutrinos and dark energy (DE) have entered a new era of investigation, as the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements tighten the constraints on the neutrino mass and suggest that DE may be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of simultaneously incorporating $\sum m_\nu$ and $N_{\rm eff}$ within the framework of dynamical DE. A joint analysis of DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background, DESY5 supernova, and DESY1 weak lensing data yields a total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu = 0.098^{+0.016}_{-0.037}\,\mathrm{eV}$, indicating a preference for a positive neutrino mass at the $2.7\sigma$ level within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. This work highlights the important influence of the strength of evidence for dynamically evolving DE on the measurement of neutrino mass, with stronger evidence for DE dynamics leading to a larger neutrino mass. These results underscore the importance of measuring the neutrino mass within the framework of dynamical DE, particularly in light of the forthcoming, more complete DESI data releases.</p>

<p>2025-07-22, <strong>Exploring the properties of newborn pulsars with high-energy neutrinos</strong>, Zi-Zhuo Xiao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16551v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.16551v1</a></p>

<p>Newborn pulsars resulting from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are promising sources of high-energy (HE) cosmic rays and neutrinos. In this work, we focus on HE neutrinos generated by interactions between protons accelerated in relativistic pulsar winds and SN ejecta. Using a binned likelihood analysis, we evaluate the detection prospects of these neutrinos with IceCube and explore their potential for probing the initial spin period ($P$) and magnetic field strength ($B$) of newborn pulsars. Noticing a degeneracy in neutrino signal with $B/P^2$ across a broad parameter space, we find that HE neutrinos from a galactic newborn pulsar ($d=10$ kpc) with $(B/10^{12}~{\rm G})(P/{\rm ms})^{-2} \gtrsim 0.003$ can be detected at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$ significance. Even in the absence of a nearby pulsar, the diffuse flux from the cosmologic population of pulsars could be probed by next-generation detectors like IceCube-Gen2 and GRAND200k. For galactic pulsars with $(B/10^{12}~{\rm G})(P/{\rm ms})^{-2} \gtrsim 0.08$, the combination $B/P^2$ can be measured with an accuracy of better than 20\% at the $3\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, we show that for pulsars with detectable HE neutrino signals, the emission can be clearly distinguished from neutrinos produced by interactions between SN ejecta and the circumstellar medium, due to their distinct temporal and spectral features.</p>

<p>2025-07-22, <strong>Dark matter explanations for the neutrino emission from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068</strong>, Kensuke Akita et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16539v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.16539v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the possibility that the high-energy neutrino flux observed from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 originates from dark matter annihilations within the density spike surrounding the supermassive black hole at its center. The comparatively lower gamma-ray flux is attributed to a dark sector that couples predominantly to Standard Model neutrinos. To explain the absence of a corresponding neutrino signal from the center of the Milky Way, we propose two scenarios: (i) the disruption of the dark matter spike at the Milky Way center due to stellar heating, or (ii) the annihilation into a dark scalar that decays exclusively into neutrinos, with a decay length longer than the size of the Milky Way but shorter than the distance from Earth to NGC 1068.</p>

<p>2025-07-22, <strong>Very-high-energy observations of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151 with MAGIC – Indication of another gamma-ray obscured candidate neutrino source</strong>, K. Abe et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16527v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.16527v1</a></p>

<p>Seyfert galaxies are emerging as a promising source class of high-energy neutrinos. The Seyfert galaxies NGC 4151 and NGC 1068 have come up respectively as the most promising counterparts of a 3$\sigma$ and of a 4.2$\sigma$ neutrino excesses detected by IceCube in the TeV energy range. Constraining the very-high-energy (VHE) emission associated with the neutrino signal is crucial to unveil the mechanism and site of neutrino production. In this work, we present the first results of the VHE observations ($\sim$29 hours) of NGC 4151 with the MAGIC telescopes. We detect no gamma-ray excess in the direction of NGC 4151, and we derive constraining upper limits on the VHE gamma-ray flux. The integral flux upper limit (at the 95% confidence level) above 200 GeV is $f = 2.3 \times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The comparison of the MAGIC and IceCube measurements suggests the presence of a gamma-ray obscured accelerator, and it allows us to constrain the gamma-ray optical depth and the size of the neutrino production site.</p>

<p>2025-07-22, <strong>Recent advances on multimessenger astrophysics: Centaurus A, GW 170817, and KM3-230213A</strong>, Cainã de Oliveira et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16392v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.16392v1</a></p>

<p>We review recent advances in multimessenger astrophysics, with particular emphasis on Centaurus A and on two pivotal events: the gravitational-wave detection GW 170817 and the ultra-high-energy neutrino KM3-230213A. Centaurus A is the prototype multimessenger source. The GW 170817 event, arising from a binary neutron star merger, marked a transformative moment in astronomy through the joint observation of gravitational waves and a broad spectrum of electromagnetic signals. The KM3-230213A neutrino, detected by the KM3NeT Collaboration, is the most energetic neutrino observed to date and poses significant challenges for current models, given its tension with null results from IceCube and the Pierre Auger Observatory. We assess astrophysical interpretations, including galactic, cosmogenic, and transient extragalactic sources, as well as implications for cosmic-ray acceleration. These cases underscore the scientific potential of high-energy multimessenger events in probing both the extreme universe and new physics.</p>

<p>2025-07-22, <strong>Probing Double-Peaked Gamma-Ray Spectra from Primordial Black Holes with Next-Generation Gamma-Ray Experiments</strong>, C. J. Ouseph et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16244v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.16244v1</a></p>

<p>Primordial black holes (PBHs), hypothesized to form in the early universe from gravitational collapse of density fluctuations, represent a well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidate. Their potential detection through gamma-ray signatures arising from Hawking radiation would provide definitive evidence for their existence and constrain their contribution to the DM abundance. Unlike conventional DM candidates, PBHs emit a unique, thermal-like spectrum of particles as they evaporate, including photons, neutrinos, and possible beyond-the-Standard Model particles. Future high-sensitivity gamma-ray observatories, such as e-ASTROGAM and other next-generation telescopes, will play a pivotal role in this search. With improved energy resolution and sensitivity, these missions can disentangle PBH-originating photons from astrophysical backgrounds, probe subtle spectral features such as multi-peak structures, and test exotic evaporation models. Such observations could either confirm PBHs as a viable DM component or place stringent limits on their abundance across critical mass windows. In this work, we explore the distinguishing features of a double-peaked gamma-ray spectrum produced by PBHs, focusing on the asteroid-mass window ($10^{15}$ g to $10^{17}$ g), where Hawking radiation peaks in the MeV to GeV range. Using a likelihood-based analysis, we demonstrate how future missions could discriminate between single- and double-peaked PBH scenarios, the latter arising in cosmological models predicting multi-modal PBH mass distributions. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of spectral shape analysis in identifying PBH populations and constrain the parameter space for which a double-peaked signal could be detectable above background.</p>

<p>2025-07-22, <strong>Three-loop induced neutrino mass model in a non-invertible symmetry</strong>, Hiroshi Okada et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16198v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.16198v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a new type of radiatively induced neutrino masses at three-loop level based on the Ma model, introducing a non-invertible symmetry in the class under a ${\mathbb Z_2}$ gauging of ${\mathbb Z_6}$ symmetry and adding three isospin doublet vector-like fermions $L’$ and singlet boson $S_0$. Under this symmetry, the Yukawa interactions directly related to the neutrino masses are not allowed at tree-level. However it is allowed at one-loop level due to $L’$ and $S_0$ as well as $\eta$, which is no longer invariant under this symmetry. Therefore, the symmetry is dynamically broken. Intriguingly, $\eta$ plays important roles in contributing to both the radiative matrices $y^\eta$ and $m_\nu$. After constructing our model, we show some numerical analyses to satisfy the lepton flavor violations, muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment, and a boson dark matter candidate $S_0$ or $\eta_R$ for the cases of normal hierarchy and inverted hierarchy. Then, we demonstrate allowed space for our input parameters.</p>

<p>2025-07-21, <strong>Prospects for GeV Neutrino Transient Searches with the IceCube Upgrade</strong>, Yukiho Kobayashi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16050v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.16050v1</a></p>

<p>The recent detection of TeV neutrino sources by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory demonstrates the detector’s advanced capabilities in detecting high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. At lower energies, down to the GeV range, a variety of transient phenomena, such as novae, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts, are expected to emit neutrinos. Observations of these neutrinos can provide unique insights into processes below the photosphere and offer clues to identifying their emission mechanisms. We have searched for these neutrinos intensively with IceCube’s existing infill array, DeepCore. Although no significant detections have been made, strong constraints on astrophysical environments in these transients, such as the baryon loading factor in gamma-ray bursts, have been obtained. A denser infill array, called the IceCube Upgrade, will enhance sub-TeV neutrino searches with its unprecedented sensitivity to GeV neutrinos. The Upgrade, set to be deployed in the 2025-2026 South Pole season, will consist of seven new strings, adding approximately 700 novel optical modules with multiple photomultiplier tubes in the DeepCore volume. The denser arrangement of high-efficiency modules will significantly improve IceCube’s sensitivity between 1 GeV and 1 TeV. We present an initial assessment of the astrophysical capabilities of the IceCube Upgrade, using preliminary simulated data and an event selection similar to that used for DeepCore. We explore the detectability of GeV neutrino transients compared to DeepCore and discuss potential sensitivity enhancements through advanced detector simulations and optimized analysis techniques, including refined triggering conditions and event selection criteria.</p>

<p>2025-07-21, <strong>Sub-GeV Dark Matter Under Pressure from Direct Detection</strong>, Andrew Cheek et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15956v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.15956v1</a></p>

<p>The DAMIC-M collaboration recently reported impressive bounds on sub-GeV dark matter, robustly testing both thermal and non-thermal models for the very first time. In this work we derive novel bounds from the recent PandaX-4T ionization S2-only search for Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS). We find that the PandaX-4T S2-only data is able to compete with the DAMIC-M results, providing the best constraints for scalar and asymmetric thermal dark matter models for masses between 20 to 200 MeV. We further discuss the implications of recent direct detection results for several other sub-GeV dark matter models, highlighting their complementarity with astrophysical, cosmological and laboratory probes.</p>

<p>2025-07-21, <strong>Opportunities and challenges to study solar neutrinos with a Q-Pix pixel readout</strong>, M. Á. García-Peris et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15459v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.15459v1</a></p>

<p>The study of solar neutrinos presents significant opportunities in astrophysics, nuclear physics, and particle physics. However, the low-energy nature of these neutrinos introduces considerable challenges to isolate them from background events, requiring detectors with low-energy threshold, high spatial and energy resolutions, and low data rate. We present the study of solar neutrinos with a kiloton-scale liquid argon detector located underground, instrumented with a pixel readout using the Q-Pix technology. We explore the potential of using volume fiducialization, directional topological information, light signal coincidence and pulse-shape discrimination to enhance solar neutrino sensitivity. We find that discriminating neutrino signals below 5 MeV is very difficult. However, we show that these methods are useful for the detection of solar neutrinos when external backgrounds are sufficiently understood and when the detector is built using low-background techniques. When building a workable background model for this study, we identify {\gamma} background from the cavern walls and from capture of {\alpha} particles in radon decay chains as both critical to solar neutrino sensitivity and significantly underconstrained by existing measurements. Finally, we highlight that the main advantage of the use of Q-Pix for solar neutrino studies lies in its ability to enable the continuous readout of all low-energy events with minimal data rates and manageable storage for further offline analyses.</p>

<p>2025-07-22, <strong>Abelian-Higgs vortices in the oscillating axion background</strong>, Naoya Kitajima et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16720v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.16720v1</a></p>

<p>We study the dynamics of Abelian-Higgs vortices in the background of a coherently oscillating axion field. We show that the electric field is induced in the magnetic core of the vortex due to the axion-photon conversion. Moreover, because the electromagnetic field is confined in the vortex and excluded from the superconducting bulk regions due to the Meissner effect, the vortex tube can be regarded as a cylindrical cavity, and our numerical analysis shows that the resonant cavity mode (TM010 mode) can be efficiently enhanced in this tube. We also focus on the interaction of two vortices in the oscillating axion background, resulting in attractive or repulsive forces, even in the case with the BPS limit. These new features open up a new possibility for the axion dark matter search using superconducting devices.</p>

<p>2025-07-22, <strong>Cosmology with a Non-minimally Coupled Dark Matter Fluid I. Background Evolution</strong>, Samuele Silveravalle et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16614v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.16614v1</a></p>

<p>We explore a cosmological model in which dark matter is non-minimally coupled to gravity at the fluid level. While typically subdominant compared to Standard Model forces, such couplings may dominate dark matter dynamics. We show that this interaction modifies the early-time Friedmann equations, driving a phase of accelerated expansion that can resolve the horizon and flatness problems without introducing additional fields. At even earlier times, the coupling to spatial curvature may give rise to a cosmological bounce, replacing the initial singularity of standard cosmology. These results suggest that non-minimally coupled dark matter could offer a unified framework for addressing both the singularity and fine-tuning problems.</p>

<p>2025-07-22, <strong>Forecast constraints on null tests of the $Λ$CDM model with SPHEREx</strong>, Alejandro Mata Román et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16604v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.16604v1</a></p>

<p>In this work we quantify the ability of the upcoming SPHEREx survey to constrain cosmological observables and test the internal consistency of the cosmological constant and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. Using Fisher matrix forecasting, we assess the expected precision on Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) observables, such as the angular diameter distance $D_\mathrm{A}(z)$ and the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. We further explore SPHEREx’s potential to probe some of the fundamental assumptions of large-scale spatial homogeneity and isotropy, through model-independent reconstructions of several consistency tests of the $\Lambda$CDM model. In addition, we also examine the effect of the model dependence of the resulting Fisher and covariance matrices, using a neural network (NN) classification approach. We find that, while it is commonly assumed the covariance matrix depends weakly on the model, in fact the NN can very accurately ($\sim 98\%$) detect the underlying fiducial cosmological model based solely on the covariance matrix of the data, thus challenging this assumption.</p>

<p>2025-07-22, <strong>Impact of cavities on the detection of quadratically coupled ultra-light dark matter</strong>, Clare Burrage et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16526v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.16526v1</a></p>

<p>Ultra-light scalar fields may explain the nature of the dark matter in our universe. If such scalars couple quadratically to particles of the Standard Model the scalar acquires an effective mass which depends on the local matter energy density. The changing mass causes the field to deviate from its cosmological value in experimental environments. In this work we show that the presence of a local over-density enclosing the experiment, for example a cavity, vacuum chamber, or satellite can strongly suppress the value of the scalar and its gradient in the interior. This makes detection of such scalar dark matter challenging, and significantly relaxes constraints on strongly coupled models. We also discuss the possibility that quadratically coupled ultra-light scalar dark matter could be detected by the differential measurement of the force on two cavities of the same mass but different internal structure.</p>

<p>We investigate the structural and physical properties of strange stars admixed with dark matter by modeling the total energy density as a weighted combination of quark matter and bosonic dark matter components regulated by a volume fraction. Both the components are assumed to be distributed throughout the star. The quark matter is described by a linear equation of state (EOS), whereas the bosonic dark matter follows an EOS with repulsive self-interactions. By combining these into a single effective EOS, we reduce the two-fluid system to an equivalent one-fluid model and numerically solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations to obtain the mass-radius (M-R) relationship of the hybrid configuration. We systematically analyze how the stellar structure is modified by varying dark matter fractions, the mass of the dark matter particle and the self-repulsion coupling strength. Our results reveal distinct modifications to the M-R profiles and apparent phase behavior of the quark matter suggesting observable signatures that could offer insights into the properties of dark matter in extreme astrophysical environments. This model also provides a possible explanation for ultra-compact stars with small radii, such as XTE J1814-338, suggesting its potential nature as a hybrid star.</p>

<p>We are exploring the possibility of traversable wormholes existing in a more realistic context. Specifically, we are looking at scenarios that don’t rely on exotic factors, like having a mass shell at the throat or allowing particles and antiparticles to coexist without annihilation. To do this, we are constructing wormholes with double power-law density distributions, drawing inspiration from the Dehnen-type dark matter halo in the framework of generalized geometry-matter coupling gravity. Our investigation carefully considers the challenges of traversability and stability, as well as the roles of exotic matter, the exoticity parameter, and the anisotropy parameter. We have discovered solutions that describe asymmetric, asymptotically flat traversable wormholes, supported by a smooth metric and double power-law density distributions. These solutions successfully avoid the problems, giving us hope that such wormholes could actually exist in nature.</p>

<p>Inspired by the recent measurement of the scalar spectral index, $n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 data, we present an update on the split supersymmetry hybrid inflation model, also known as $\mu$-term hybrid inflation. The model employs a canonical K"{a}hler potential but incorporates an additional renormalizable term in the superpotential $W$, which yields the MSSM $\mu$-term following supersymmetry breaking. This additional term in $W$ is responsible for a high reheat temperature, $T_r \gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV, and consequently the necessity of split supersymmetry in this class of models. The predicted scalar spectral index is in excellent agreement with the ACT measurement and $r$, the tensor to scalar ratio, is estimated to be less than or of order $10^{-2} -10^{-3}$. For the running of the scalar spectral index we find $|dn_s/d \ln k| = O(10^{-4})$. With $T_r \gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV, leptogenesis is readily implemented in this class of models. A wino-like LSP with mass of around 2 TeV is a plausible dark matter candidate.</p>

<p>The timing of cosmic reionization across Local Group (LG) analogues provides insights into their early histories and surrounding large-scale structure. Using the radiation-hydrodynamic simulation THESAN-1 and its dark matter-only counterpart THESAN-DARK-1, we track the reionization histories of all haloes, including 224 LG analogues within the proximity of any of the 20 Virgo-like clusters with halo masses above 10^14 Msun at z=0 and their environments. The statistically controlled samples quantify how the reionization redshift (z_reion) correlates with halo mass, local overdensity, and present-day pair properties. Even at fixed mass, haloes in denser regions ionize earlier, and increasing the overdensity smoothing scale systematically suppresses small-scale structure, including local variations and environmental gradients in z_reion. Virgo-like clusters accelerate reionization in their surroundings out to ~5-10 cMpc, beyond which local overdensity again becomes the dominant factor. Within LG pairs, reionization timing offsets reach up to ~150 Myr and correlate with present-day halo separation, reflecting sensitivity to large-scale structure rather than mass ratio in driving asynchronous reionization. The results support an extreme inside-out picture where clustered sources rapidly ionize their immediate neighborhoods, while lower-density regions self-ionize later and voids wait for external homogenization. These links between environment and reionization timing explain the influence of protoclusters and help interpret fossil records in LG dwarfs around the Milky Way. For Milky Way analogues, we find a reionization redshift as early (late) as z_reion = 12.7^{+2.0}_{-1.7} (8.88^{+0.66}_{-0.70}) when considered on 125 ckpc (500 ckpc) scales, with LG analogues following an inside-out reionization picture.</p>

<p>We extend our super-resolution and emulation framework for cosmological dark matter simulations to include hydrodynamics. We present a two-stage deep learning model to emulate high-resolution (HR-HydroSim) baryonic fields from low-resolution (LR-HydroSim) simulations at redshift $z = 3$. The method takes as inputs an LR-HydroSim and the high-resolution initial conditions (HR-HydroICs). First, the model stochastically generates high-resolution baryonic fields from the LR-HydroSim. Second, a deterministic emulator refines these fields using HR-HydroICs to reconstruct small-scale structures including displacement, velocity, internal energy, and gas/star classification. Trained on paired low- and high-resolution simulations produced with \texttt{MP-Gadget}, the model captures small-scale structures of the intergalactic medium and %Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observables down to the 100 kpc pressure smoothing scale relevant to the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. The model achieves subpercent error for overdensity, temperature, velocity, and optical depth fields, a mean relative error of 1.07\% in the large-scale flux power spectrum ((k &lt; 3 \times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{s/km})), and less than 10\% error in the flux probability distribution function. Notably, the two-stage model reduces the compute time by a factor of $\sim$450 compared to full smoothed particle hydrodynamics at the same resolution. This work demonstrates the potential of this framework as a powerful and efficient tool for generating high-resolution fields offering fast and accurate alternatives to traditional cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and enabling large-volume mock datasets for next-generation cosmological surveys.</p>

<p>The uniqueness theorems for general relativity and Yang-Mills theories can be circumvented by dropping the ubiquitous, yet often implicit, assumption that physical fields, such as the spacetime metric, are fundamental. The novel concept of emergent fields makes it possible to construct modified theories of gravity and forces where the spacetime metric and strength tensor fields emerge from a covariance analysis in the canonical formulation with nontrivial relations to the fundamental phase space and no additional degrees of freedom are required. This is an example of a post-Einstein-Yang-Mills theory that implies new physics. In particular, explicit realizations of the theory in symmetry-reduced systems have shown robust resolutions of the singularities that plague the classical theories in regions of extreme spacetime curvature, including nonsingular (SU(2)xU(1)-charged) black holes with a cosmologial constant and collapsing solutions, as well as Gowdy and FLRW cosmologies. Further applications include modifications in the spectrum of quasinormal modes and in the evaporation process of black holes, as well as relativistic formulations of long-range gravitational effects capable of modeling MOND as an alternative solution to the dark matter problem. New results here include an extension of the spherically symmetric system that couples SU(2) gauge fields and the generalization of previous dynamical, homogeneous solutions.</p>

<p>While cold dark matter is widely supported by a range of cosmological observations, it encounters several difficulties at smaller scales. These issues have prompted the investigation of various alternative dark matter candidates, leaving the question “What is dark matter?” still open. In this work, we propose a new cosmological model that considers dark matter as a barotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter and interprets dark energy as the phenomenological emergent dark energy rather than a cosmological constant. We then place constraints on our new model using the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy measurements, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the Pantheon Plus (PP) compilation of Type Ia supernovae (Ia SNe), and the Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) data from Gold2018. The results show statistically significant signal for positive dark matter equation of state and square of sound speed $w_{\rm dm}=c_{\rm s,dm}^2$ ($10^{7}w_{\rm dm}$ = $4.0^{+2.5}_{-2.3}$ at the 95\% confidence level) for the data combination CMB+DESI+PP+RSD. However, Bayesian evidence indicates that this data combination favors the $\Lambda$CDM model with very strong evidence.</p>

<p>Dark matter (DM) remains undetected, and developing theoretical models such as the promising perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) is a key challenge in modern cosmology. In this work, we investigate the quantum characteristics of PFDM by analyzing the behavior of quantum entanglement and coherence for both fermionic and bosonic fields near a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a PFDM halo. Our results reveal that PFDM can either enhance or degrade quantum entanglement and coherence, depending sensitively on its density. Notably, bosonic entanglement shows greater susceptibility to PFDM effects compared to fermionic entanglement, while fermionic coherence exhibits a stronger dependence on PFDM than its bosonic counterpart. These findings highlight the necessity of selecting appropriate quantum probes for DM detection based on the type of quantum resources, as different quantum fields exhibit significantly different responses to PFDM in curved spacetime.</p>

<p>2025-07-21, <strong>Observation of a phase transition in KTaO$_3$ induced by residual niobium impurities</strong>, Zijun C. Zhao et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16093v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.16093v1</a></p>

<p>We report the observation of a phase transition in a KTaO$_3$ crystal, corresponding to a paraelectric-to-ferroelectric transition. The crystal was placed inside a copper cavity to form a dielectric-loaded microwave cavity, and the transition was observed to occur near 134 K. As the cavity was cooled, the frequencies of both transverse electric and transverse magnetic resonant modes decreased (corresponding to an increase in permittivity). The mode frequencies converge at the transition temperature (near 134 K) and, below this point, reverse their tuning direction, increasing their frequency with decreasing temperature. This behaviour corresponds to a decrease in dielectric permittivity and is atypical for pure KTaO$_3$. To investigate further, we conducted impurity analysis using Laser Ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), revealing a significant concentration ($\sim$ 7\%) of niobium (Nb) in the crystal. This suggests that the observed phase transition is driven by residual Nb impurities, which induce ferroelectricity in an otherwise paraelectric host. Similar crystals with a lower concentration ($&lt;$ 2\%) did not undergo a phase transition but exhibited a loss peak at this temperature. These findings have practical implications for the design of tunable devices, for example, resonator-based dark matter detectors, where low-loss material phase stability and tunability are crucial.</p>

<p>The astrophysical origin of observed low-mass compact binary coalescences in the 1-2.5 $M_{\odot}$ range remains ambiguous. Both binary neutron star (BNS) and binary low-mass black hole (LMBH) mergers produce nearly identical inspiral waveforms, and electromagnetic follow-up is not always possible. Distinguishing between these scenarios therefore presents a key challenge. We demonstrate that waveform differences in the late-inspiral to postmerger epochs create significant mismatches that will be detectable by planned detectors, viz., NEMO, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope, while the currently operational LIGO A+ will be effective only for nearby sources. These differences are enhanced for stiffer equations of state. We show how the redshift-dependent compact binary merger rate inferred from gravitational wave observations can be parsed into BNS and LMBH components, accounting for misclassification probability. We forecast model-independent 90% exclusion sensitivities for the LMBH fraction. Interpreting these LMBHs as dark matter capture-induced transmuted black holes, we convert exclusion sensitivities into projected exclusion bounds on heavy non-annihilating dark matter. Our results illustrate how gravitational wave measurements can disentangle compact object populations and provide new insights into particle dark matter interactions.</p>

<p>We forecast the reach of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) to the full set of real representations within the paradigm of minimal dark matter. We employ effective field theory techniques to compute the annihilation cross section and photon spectrum that results when fermionic dark matter is the neutral component of an arbitrary odd and real representation of SU(2), including the Sommerfeld enhancement, next-to-leading log resummation of the relevant electroweak effects, and the contribution from bound states. We also compute the corresponding signals for scalar dark matter, with the exception of the bound state contribution. Results are presented for all real representations from the $\sim$3 TeV triplet (or wino), a $\mathbf{3}$ of SU(2), to the $\sim$300 TeV tredecuplet, a $\mathbf{13}$ of SU(2) that is at the threshold of the unitarity bound. Using these results, we forecast that with 500 hrs of Galactic Center observations and assuming background systematics are controlled at the level of ${\cal O}(1\%)$, then should no signal emerge, CTAO could exclude all representations up to the $\mathbf{11}$ of SU(2) in even the most conservative models for the dark-matter density in the inner galaxy, in both the fermionic and scalar dark matter cases. Assuming the default CTAO configuration, the tredecuplet will marginally escape exclusion, although we outline steps that CTAO could take to test even this scenario. In summary, CTAO appears poised to make a definitive statement on whether real WIMPs constitute the dark matter of our universe.</p>

<p>Models which solve the strong CP problem by employing discrete spacetime symmetries generically suffer fine-tuning and quality problems. We demonstrate that these issues are greatly ameliorated when the only source of spontaneous CP breaking is from the chiral condensate of a strongly coupled hidden sector. This is shown explicitly in a model with the SM extended by a vector-like quark family and a complex scalar portal to QCD-like dark sector with $N_f$ families of dark fermions that confines at a high scale. The dark pions of the hidden sector are natural dark matter candidates, with the correct relic abundance obtained via freeze-in. These “confining” Nelson-Barr solutions connect phenomenological questions regarding the strong CP problem to recent developments in the understanding of confining gauge theories, and present ample room for further model building.</p>

<p>We show that minimal, fermionic dark matter (DM) models in the $n$-dimensional representation of the weak force with zero hypercharge that make up 100% of the DM under the standard cosmological history are strongly excluded for $n &lt; 9$. This includes the thermal wino, which we show is ruled out even allowing for DM core sizes up to $\sim$6.7 kpc with the preferred local DM density or $\sim$3.7 kpc in addition to the local DM density being half the preferred value, at less than $0.2$ GeV/cm$^3$. We reach these conclusions through dedicated searches with 14 years of Fermi gamma-ray data in the inner Galaxy between 30 GeV and 2 TeV for the continuum gamma-rays produced in the decays of unstable particles produced in DM annihilation and bound-state formation processes. We consider a variety of Milky Way DM profiles in our analyses, including those motivated by modern hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, and show that all the $n &lt; 9$ minimal DM models are disfavored even under the most conservative assumptions for these density profiles. While wino, quintuplet ($n=5$), and $n = 7$ DM models are strongly disfavored by our analyses under the standard cosmology, we discuss how non-standard cosmological histories or DM sub-fractions could still allow for these particles to be realized in nature, with discovery opportunities at next-generation particle colliders and gamma-ray telescopes.</p>

<p>We extend the Standard Model (SM) by introducing a $U(1)’$ gauge boson and a real pseudo-scalar field, both odd under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The resulting low-energy spectrum consists of a stable vector as the dark matter candidate, and a pseudo-scalar mediator, which interacts with the SM via a Higgs portal coupling and a dimension-five portal connecting it to both the dark and visible photons. We explore the freeze-in of both particles at low reheating temperature, finding a rich yield evolution dynamics in the early Universe. This setup brings a consistent dark matter scenario in which the dark photon relic abundance is generated through freeze-in at low reheating temperatures. In addition to its cosmological viability, the model can be tested at the LHC: Higgs bosons can decay into dark photons and displaced visible photons via the long-lived mediator. These signatures allow us to constrain the Higgs portal coupling using recent searches for non-pointing photons and limits on invisible or undetected Higgs decays. We derive meaningful constraints on the dark matter parameter space, in particular excluding a thermalized mediator in the region compatible with the observed relic abundance.</p>

<p>The Euclid mission of the European Space Agency will deliver galaxy and cosmic shear surveys, which will be used to constrain initial conditions and statistics of primordial fluctuations. We present highlights for the Euclid scientific capability to test initial conditions beyond LCDM with the main probes, i.e. 3D galaxy clustering from the spectroscopic survey, the tomographic approach to 3x2pt statistics from photometric galaxy survey, and their combination. We provide Fisher forecasts from the combination of Euclid spectroscopic and photometric surveys for spatial curvature, running of the spectral index of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations, isocurvature perturbations, and primordial features. For the parameters of these models we also provide the combination of Euclid forecasts (pessimistic and optimistic) with current and future measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies., i.e. Planck, the Simons Observatory (SO), and CMB-S4. We provide Fisher forecasts for how the power spectrum and bispectrum from the Euclid spectroscopic survey will constrain the local, equilateral, and orthogonal shapes of primordial non-Gaussianity. We also review how Bayesian field-level inference of primordial non-Gaussianity can constrain local primordial non-Gaussianity. We show how Euclid, with its unique combination of the main probes, will provide the tightest constraints on low redshift to date. By targeting a markedly different range in redshift and scale, Euclid’s expected uncertainties are complementary to those obtained by CMB primary anisotropy, returning the tightest combined constraints on the physics of the early Universe.</p>

<p>One of the major problems in quantum gravity research is the lack of signals at the reach of present or near-future experimental facilities. In this paper, we show that this is not the case. Contrary to previous claims, the quantum decay of de Sitter space into black hole spacetimes can be significant even after inflation and can be observed on galactic scales. Using the instanton formalism within the no-boundary proposal for a class of short-scale, quantum-gravity-improved black holes, we show that de Sitter space decay would result in the production of $10^{60}$ stable Planck-size black hole remnants within the current Hubble horizon, which is the number required to explain dark matter.</p>

<p>We investigate the cosmological matter creation scenario, an alternative approach to both dark energy and modified gravity theories, after the recent DESI DR2-BAO release. We consider that the total matter sector consists of three independently evolving components, namely, radiation, baryons, and dark matter, with the latter being governed by an adiabatic matter creation process that leads to a modified continuity equation. Due to the violation of the standard conservation law, a creation pressure appears, and under a proper choice of dark-matter particle creation rate one can obtain the present accelerating phase as well as the past thermal history of the Universe. We study two specific matter creation rates. By applying the dynamical-system analysis we show that both Model I and Model II can mimic a $\Lambda$CDM-like behavior. Furthermore, we perform a detailed observational confrontation using a series of latest observational datasets including Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) (Pantheon+, DESY5 and Union3 samples) and DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) (DR1 and DR2 samples). In both Model I and Model II we find evidence of matter creation at many standard deviations. Finally, applying the AIC and BIC information criteria we find that Model I is statistically equivalent with $\Lambda$CDM scenario, while Model II shows a mixed picture, namely for most datasets $\Lambda$CDM scenario is favoured, however when DESI data are included matter creation Model II is favoured over $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</p>

<p>Time-domain astrophysics relies on heterogeneous and multi-modal data. Specialized models are often constructed to extract information from a single modality, but this approach ignores the wealth of cross-modality information that may be relevant for the tasks to which the model is applied. In this work, we propose a multi-modal, mixture-of-expert variational autoencoder to learn a joint embedding for supernova light curves and spectra. Our method, which is inspired by the Perceiver architecture, natively accommodates variable-length inputs and the irregular temporal sampling inherent to supernova light curves. We train our model on radiative transfer simulations and validate its performance on cross-modality reconstruction of supernova spectra and physical parameters from the simulation. Our model achieves superior performance in cross-modality generation to nearest-neighbor searches in a contrastively-trained latent space, showing its promise for constructing informative latent representations of multi-modal astronomical datasets.</p>

Boyer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16766v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.16766v1</a></p>

<p>Low-resolution infrared spectroscopy from JWST confirms the presence of SiC and likely metallic iron dust around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the Sextans A dwarf galaxy, which has a metallicity ~1%-7% Z_sun. While metal-poor carbon-rich AGB stars are known to produce copious amounts of amorphous carbon dust owing to the dredge up of newly synthesized carbon, this is the first time that Si- and Fe-bearing dust has been detected at this extreme metallicity. Of the six AGB stars observed, one is an intermediate-mass (~1.2-4 M_sun) carbon star showing SiC dust, and another is an oxygen-rich M-type star with mass ~4-5 M_sun that is likely undergoing hot bottom burning. The infrared excess of the M-type star is strong, but featureless. We tested multiple dust species, and find that it is best fit with metallic iron dust. Assuming its dust-production rate stays constant over the final 2-3x10^4 yr of its evolution, this star will produce ~0.9-3.7 times the iron dust mass predicted by models, with the range depending on the adopted stellar mass. The implications for dust production in high-redshift galaxies are potentially significant, especially regarding the assumed dust species used in dust evolution models and the timescale of AGB dust formation. Stars on the upper end of the AGB mass range can begin producing dust as early as 30-50 Myr after they form, and they may therefore rival dust production by supernovae at high redshift.</p>

<p>I suggest the double-degenerate (DD) scenario with a merger-to-explosion delay (MED) time (the DD-MED scenario) of about 1-2 years to explain the rare properties of the recently analyzed type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2020aeuh. The rare properties are the SN Ia ejecta interacting with a carbon-oxygen (CO)-rich circumstellar material (CSM) at approximately 50 days post-explosion. In this DD-MED scenario, two massive CO white dwarfs (WDs), masses of M1=1.1Mo and M2=1, merge to leave a rapidly rotating lonely WD of about the Chandrasekhar mass. The merger process ejects 0.7Mo to form a nonspherical CO-rich CSM. At the explosion, there is a lonely WD and a detached hydrogen- and helium-deficient CSM. Studies proposed the other lonely WD scenario, the core-degenerate (CD) scenario, to explain several specific SNe Ia and SN Ia remnants. SN 2020aeuh is the first particular SN Ia that is attributed to the DD-MED scenario. Besides being slightly brighter than typical SNe Ia and the CSM interaction, SN 2020aeuh is a normal SN Ia. Therefore, this study strengthens the claim that the lonely WD scenarios, i.e., the DD-MED and CD scenarios, account for most, if not all, normal SNe Ia; all SN Ia scenarios, whether lonely WD or not, might contribute to peculiar SNe Ia.</p>

<p>Observations in the Galaxy and nearby spirals have established that the HI-to-H$_2$ transition at solar metallicity occurs at gas weight of $P_{\rm DE}/k_B\approx 10^4 \ \rm K \ cm ^{-3}$, similar to solar neighbourhood conditions. Even so, state-of-the-art models of a self-regulated interstellar medium underproduce the molecular fraction ($R_{\rm mol}\equiv M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\rm HI}$) at solar neighbourhood conditions by a factor of $\approx2-4$. We use the GHOSDT suite of simulations at a mass resolution range of $100-0.25\ M_{\odot}$ (effective spatial resolution range of $\sim 20-0.05\ \rm pc$) run for 500 Myr to show how this problem is affected by modeling choices such as the inclusion of photoionizing radiation, assumed supernova energy, numerical resolution, inclusion of magnetic fields, and including a model for sub-grid clumping. We find that $R_{\rm mol}$ is not converged even at a resolution of 1 $M_{\odot}$, with $R_{\rm mol}$ increasing by a factor of 2 when resolution is improved from 10 to $1\ M_{\odot}$. Models excluding either photoionization or magnetic fields result in a factor 2 reduction in $R_{\rm mol}$. The only model that agrees with the observed value of $R_{\rm mol}$ includes our sub-grid clumping model, which enhances $R_{\rm mol}$ by a factor of $\sim3$ compared with our fiducial model. This increases the time-averaged $R_{\rm mol}$ to $0.25$, in agreement with the Solar circle value, and closer to the observed median value of $0.42$ in regions comparable to the solar neighbourhood in nearby spirals. Our findings show that small-scale clumping in the ISM plays a significant role in H$_2$ formation even in high-resolution numerical simulations.</p>

<p>Although light nuclear clusters are known to affect the properties of warm and dilute nuclear matter, their role in warm and dense nuclear matter remains unclear due to the lack of experimental evidence for their modifications by the Mott effect in such an environment. To address this issue, we resort to intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions, where light clusters are mainly produced in the transiently formed warm and dense matter. A kinetic approach, which includes dynamically the formation and dissociation of light clusters, is employed to deduce the strength of the Mott effects and the $\alpha$-particle fraction in warm and dense nuclear matter from the light-nuclei yields measured by the FOPI Collaboration in central Au$+$Au collisions at energies of $0.25A$ to $0.6A~\rm GeV$. We find an unexpectedly abundant $\alpha$ clustering in this environment, which will have profound implications for modeling the nuclear equation of state and describing supernovae and neutron star mergers.</p>

<p>While cold dark matter is widely supported by a range of cosmological observations, it encounters several difficulties at smaller scales. These issues have prompted the investigation of various alternative dark matter candidates, leaving the question “What is dark matter?” still open. In this work, we propose a new cosmological model that considers dark matter as a barotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter and interprets dark energy as the phenomenological emergent dark energy rather than a cosmological constant. We then place constraints on our new model using the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy measurements, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the Pantheon Plus (PP) compilation of Type Ia supernovae (Ia SNe), and the Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) data from Gold2018. The results show statistically significant signal for positive dark matter equation of state and square of sound speed $w_{\rm dm}=c_{\rm s,dm}^2$ ($10^{7}w_{\rm dm}$ = $4.0^{+2.5}_{-2.3}$ at the 95\% confidence level) for the data combination CMB+DESI+PP+RSD. However, Bayesian evidence indicates that this data combination favors the $\Lambda$CDM model with very strong evidence.</p>

<p>Our understanding of cosmology is shaped by Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the runaway thermonuclear detonations of white dwarfs via accretion from a companion star. The nature of this companion star is highly debated, with disparate models explaining currently available SNe Ia data. Critical ultraviolet (UV) signatures of SNe Ia progenitors are only observable within the first few days post-detonation. We present the instrument design of UVIa, a proposed SmallSat to make early UV observations of SNe Ia. UVIa conducts simultaneous observations in three photometric channels: far-UV (1500 - 1800 {\AA}), near-UV (1800 - 2400 {\AA}), and Sloan $u$-band (3000 - 4200 {\AA}). UVIa employs two 80 mm double-offset Cassegrain UV telescopes and a similar 50 mm $u$-band telescope, imaging onto three Teledyne e2v CIS120-10-LN CMOS detectors. The UV detectors are delta-doped for enhanced sensitivity, with custom metal-dielectric filters providing further in-band efficiency and red light rejection. The UV optics utilize multi-layer coatings, defining the UV bandpasses and providing additional red light rejection. The instrument design achieves high UV sensitivity (21.5 mag AB) and superior red light rejection ($&lt;$ 10$^{-5}$ throughput), allowing UVIa to make early observations of SNe Ia while serving as a pathfinder for future UV transient telescopes.</p>

<p>The inevitable fate of massive stars in the initial mass range of ~8–30 M_{Sun} in the red supergiant (RSG) phase is a core-collapse supernova (SN) explosion, although some stars may collapse directly to a black hole. We know that this is the case, since RSGs have been directly identified and characterized for a number of supernovae (SNe) in pre-explosion archival optical and infrared images. RSGs likely all have some amount of circumstellar matter (CSM), through nominal mass loss, although evidence exists that some RSGs must experience enhanced mass loss during their lifetimes. The SNe from RSGs are hydrogen-rich Type II-Plateau (II-P), and SNe II-P at the low end of the luminosity range tend to arise from low-luminosity RSGs. The typical spectral energy distribution (SED) for such RSGs can generally be fit with a cool photospheric model, whereas the more luminous RSG progenitors of more luminous SNe II-P tend to require a greater quantity of dust in their CSM to account for their SEDs. The SN II-P progenitor luminosity range is log(L_{bol}/L_{Sun}) ~ 4.0–5.2. The fact RSGs are known up to log(L_{bol}/L_{Sun}) ~ 5.7 leads to the so-called ``RSG problem’’, which may, in the end, be a result of small number of available statistics to date.</p>

<p>2025-07-21, <strong>Red Supergiant Mass Loss and Mass-Loss Rates</strong>, Jacco Th. van Loon et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15971v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.15971v1</a></p>

<p>This review discusses the causes, nature, importance and observational evidence of mass loss by red supergiants. It arrives at the perception that mass loss finds its origin in the gravity which makes the star a star in the first place, and is a mechanism for the star to equilibrate. This is corroborated by a careful examination of various popular historical and recent empirical mass-loss rate prescriptions and theoretical works, and which provides no evidence for an explicit dependence of red supergiant mass loss on metallicity though dust-associated mass loss becomes less prevalent at lower metallicity. It also identifies a common problem in methods that use tracers of mass loss, which do not correct for varying scaling factors (often because there is no information available on which to base such correction) and as a result tend to underestimate mass-loss rates at the lower end. Conversely, dense, extended chromospheres in themselves do not translate into high mass-loss rates, and the significance of stochastic mass loss can be overstated. On a population scale, on the other hand, binary interaction acts as a stochastic agent of mass loss of great import. In all, evidence is overwhelming that points at red supergiants at the lower mass end losing mass at insufficient rates to shed their mantles before core collapse, but massive (at birth) red supergiants to be prone to intense, dusty mass loss which sees them become hotter stars before meeting their fate. This is consistent with the identified progenitors of hydrogen-rich supernovae. Supernova evolution holds great promise to probe the mass loss but we caution against confusing atmospheres with winds. Finally, promising avenues are looked into, which could forge step-change progress in what has been a long and arduous search for the holy grail of red supergiant mass loss. We may yet find it!</p>

<p>Massive stars less massive than ~30 Msol evolve into a red supergiant after the main sequence. Given a standard IMF, this means about 80% of all single massive stars will experience this phase. RSGs are dominated by convection, with a radius that may extend up to thousands of solar radii. Their low temperature and gravity make them prone to lose large amounts of masses, either through a pulsationally-driven wind or through mass-loss outburst. RSGs are the progenitors of the most common core-collapse supernovae, the type II. In the present review, we give an overview of our theoretical understanding about this spectacular phase of massive stars evolution.</p>

<p>2025-07-21, <strong>Carbon burning cannot explain puffy hypervelocity white dwarfs</strong>, Natsuko Yamaguchi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15952v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.15952v1</a></p>

<p>The dominant formation channel of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has been extensively studied for many years. Several hypervelocity white dwarfs (HVWDs) with space velocities of $\gtrsim 1000\,\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$ have recently been discovered. One possible origin of these stars is the dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) scenario, in which an accreting sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen (CO) WD detonates as a SN Ia. In this scenario, the less massive WD may survive its companion’s detonation and be ejected as a HVWD. Most of the observed HVWDs are hotter and puffier than normal WDs, perhaps due to their recent proximity to a SN. In this work, we test whether these properties can be explained by long-lived stable carbon (C) burning in the interiors of CO WD donors triggered by a SN shock. We model the long-term evolution of CO WDs following rapid energy injection using 1D models. We find that stable C burning can be ignited in CO WDs with masses of $0.95 - 1.10\,M_{\odot}$ if SN energy penetrates sufficiently deeply. The resulting born-again stars settle on the C-burning main sequence while they convert their interiors from C and O to Ne and Mg, where they have temperatures and radii similar to some of the observed HVWDs. However, the timescale over which C-burning WDs remain inflated is $\lesssim 10^5\,$yr, which is at least an order of magnitude shorter than the kinematic ages of observed hot HVWDs. We conclude that observed HVWDs are unlikely to be inflated by C burning. The stellar evolution of observed HVWDs remains an open problem.</p>

<p>2025-07-21, <strong>GRB 241105A: A test case for GRB classification and rapid r-process nucleosynthesis channels</strong>, Dimple et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15940v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.15940v1</a></p>

<p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer a powerful window to probe the progenitor systems responsible for the formation of heavy elements through the rapid neutron capture (r-) process, thanks to their exceptional luminosity, which allows them to be observed across vast cosmic distances. GRB 241105A, observed at a redshift of z = 2.681, features a short initial spike (1.5 s) and a prolonged weak emission lasting about 64 s, positioning it as a candidate for a compact binary merger and potentially marking it as the most distant merger-driven GRB observed to date. However, the emerging ambiguity in GRB classification necessitates further investigation into the burst’s true nature. Prompt emission analyses, such as hardness ratio, spectral lag, and minimum variability timescales, yield mixed classifications, while machine learning-based clustering places GRB 241105A near both long-duration mergers and collapsar GRBs. We conducted observations using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for a potential supernova counterpart. Although no conclusive evidence was found for a supernova, the host galaxy’s properties derived from the JWST observations suggest active star formation with low metallicity, and a sub-kpc offset of the afterglow from the host, which appears broadly consistent with a collapsar origin. Nevertheless, a compact binary merger origin cannot be ruled out, as the burst may plausibly arise from a fast progenitor channel. This would have important implications for heavy element enrichment in the early Universe.</p>

<p>Hydrogen/Helium-poor stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae with broad lines (SNe Ic-bl) almost always accompany the nearby ($z &lt; 0.3$) jetted relativistic explosions known as long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, the majority of SNe Ic-bl have no detected GRB counterpart. At least some of these SNe should harbor off-axis jets, whose afterglow may become detectable at late times, particularly at radio wavelengths. Here, we present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array radio observations (rest frame times of $\sim 3$-$4\times10^{3}$ days post SN discovery) of a sample of 14 SNe Ic-bl discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) that have been demonstrated to originate from the same host environments as the SNe Ic-bl associated with nearby GRBs. Of the 14 SNe, we identify three that are radio detected, one of which (PTF10tqv, $z = 0.0795$) is consistent with an off-axis jet with energy similar to classical GRBs ($\gtrsim 10^{50.5}~$erg). Using recently developed synchrotron radiation code, we find that for our 11 non-detections, which are among the deepest limits obtained for Ic-bl, we rule out an off-axis jet with an energy of $\gtrsim 10^{51}~{\rm erg}$ in circumburst densities of $\gtrsim 10^{-1}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$. We predict that well-spaced monitoring of newly discovered SNe Ic-bl from $\sim 10~$days to $\sim 10~$years (rest frame) to luminosities of $\sim 10^{27}~{\rm erg~s}^{-1}~{\rm Hz}^{-1}$ will constrain the existence of highly off-axis jets ($\gtrsim60^\circ$) with classical GRB energies. The VLA Sky Survey will probe jets that are $\lesssim 60^\circ$ off-axis, whereas the Deep Synpotic Array 2000 will probe jets out to $\sim 90^\circ$ off-axis, demonstrating the importance of utilizing radio surveys to supplement targeted observations.</p>

<p>The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs), the brightest cosmic radio explosions, is still unknown. Bearing critical clues to FRBs’ origin, the long-term evolution of FRBs has yet to be confirmed, since the field is still young and most FRBs were seen only once. Here we report clear evidence of decadal evolution of FRB~20121102A, the first precisely localized repeater. In conjunction with archival data, our FAST and GBT monitoring campaign since 2020 reveals a significant 7% decline of local dispersion measure (DM). The rotation measure (RM) of 30,755$\pm$16 $\mathrm{rad\,m^{-2}}$ detected in the last epoch represents a 70% decrease compared to that from December 2016. The $\sigma_{RM}$ parameter, which describes the complexity of the magneto-ionic environment surrounding the source, was shown to have decreased by 13%. These general trends reveal an evolving FRB environment, which could originate from an early-phase supernova associated with an enhanced pair wind from the FRB central engine.</p>

<p>We present Supernova, a 650M-parameter decoder-only transformer that demonstrates how careful architectural design and tokenization innovation can achieve the performance of larger models while maintaining computational efficiency. Our architecture combines Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), Grouped Query Attention (GQA) with a 3:1 compression ratio, RMSNorm for computational efficiency, and SwiGLU activation functions. A critical innovation is our custom 128,000-vocabulary byte-level BPE tokenizer, which achieves state-of-the-art compression performance. Through detailed analysis, we show that Supernova achieves 90% of the performance of 1B-parameter models while using 35% fewer parameters and requiring only 100B training tokens–an order of magnitude less than competing models. Our findings challenge the prevailing scaling paradigm, demonstrating that architectural efficiency and tokenization quality can compensate for reduced parameter counts.</p>

<p>In recent years, with an increasing number of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered soon after their explosions, a non-negligible fraction of SNe Ia with early-excess emissions (EExSNe Ia) have been confirmed. In this letter, we present a total of \textbf{67} early-phase normal SNe Ia from published papers and ongoing transient survey projects to systematically investigate their photometric behaviors from very early time. We found that EExSNe Ia in our sample have longer rise and brighter peak luminosities compared to those of non-EExSNe Ia. Moreover, EExSNe Ia commonly have ``red-bump” features in the early $B-V$ color while non-EExSNe Ia show blueward evolution from the very beginning. Here, we propose that the thin-helium double-detonation scenario can phenomenologically explain the photometric diversities of normal SNe Ia considering different white dwarf-He-shell mass combinations and the viewing-angle effect, implying a unified explosion mechanism of normal-type SNe Ia. To further testify the possible common origin of normal SNe Ia, systematical studies of multiband photometric and spectral properties of early-phase SNe Ia through the new generation wide-field time-domain survey facilities and global real-time follow-up networks are highly demanded.</p>

<p>2025-07-21, <strong>Accelerating Universe without dark energy: matter creation after DESI DR2</strong>, Sauvik Bhattacharjee et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15575v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.15575v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the cosmological matter creation scenario, an alternative approach to both dark energy and modified gravity theories, after the recent DESI DR2-BAO release. We consider that the total matter sector consists of three independently evolving components, namely, radiation, baryons, and dark matter, with the latter being governed by an adiabatic matter creation process that leads to a modified continuity equation. Due to the violation of the standard conservation law, a creation pressure appears, and under a proper choice of dark-matter particle creation rate one can obtain the present accelerating phase as well as the past thermal history of the Universe. We study two specific matter creation rates. By applying the dynamical-system analysis we show that both Model I and Model II can mimic a $\Lambda$CDM-like behavior. Furthermore, we perform a detailed observational confrontation using a series of latest observational datasets including Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) (Pantheon+, DESY5 and Union3 samples) and DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) (DR1 and DR2 samples). In both Model I and Model II we find evidence of matter creation at many standard deviations. Finally, applying the AIC and BIC information criteria we find that Model I is statistically equivalent with $\Lambda$CDM scenario, while Model II shows a mixed picture, namely for most datasets $\Lambda$CDM scenario is favoured, however when DESI data are included matter creation Model II is favoured over $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</p>

<p>2025-07-21, <strong>Signatures of Exploding Supermassive PopIII Stars at High Redshift in JWST, EUCLID and Roman Space Telescope</strong>, Cédric Jockel et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15556v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2507.15556v1</a></p>

<p>Recently discovered supermassive black holes with masses of $\sim10^8\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\sim9$-$11$ in active galactic nuclei (AGN) pose severe challenges to our understanding of supermassive black hole formation. One proposed channel are rapidly accreting supermassive PopIII stars (SMSs) that form in large primordial gas halos and grow up to $&lt;10^6\,M_\odot$. They eventually collapse due to the general relativistic instability and could lead to supernova-like explosions. This releases massive and energetic ejecta that then interact with the halo medium via an optically thick shock. We develop a semi-analytic model to compute the shock properties, bolometric luminosity, emission spectrum and photometry over time. The initial data is informed by stellar evolution and general relativistic SMS collapse simulations. We find that SMS explosion light curves reach a brightness $\sim10^{45\mathrm{-}47}\,\mathrm{erg/s}$ and last $10$-$200$ years in the source frame - up to $250$-$3000$ years with cosmic time dilation. This makes them quasi-persistent sources which vary indistinguishably to little red dots and AGN within $0.5$-$9\,(1+z)$ yrs. Bright SMS explosions are observable in long-wavelength JWST filters up to $z\leq20$ ($24$-$26$ mag) and pulsating SMSs up to $z\leq15$. EUCLID and the Roman space telescope (RST) can detect SMS explosions at $z&lt;11$-$12$. Their deep fields could constrain the SMS rate down to $10^{-11}$Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, which is much deeper than JWST bounds. Based on cosmological simulations and observed star formation rates, we expect to image up to several hundred SMS explosions with EUCLID and dozens with RST deep fields.</p>
