<p>2024-07-31, <strong>Final state interactions for high energy scattering off atomic electrons</strong>, Ryan Plestid et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21752v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21752v1</a></p>

<p>We consider the scattering of high energy leptons off bound atomic electrons focusing primarily on final state interactions i.e., the exchange of virtual photons between the outgoing energetic electron, and the heavy residual charged “debris” in the final state. These effects are inherently absent from calculations for a free electron at rest. Coulomb exchanges are enhanced by the large number of electrons in the atomic debris, and are unsuppressed by non-relativistic velocities in the debris. We find that these exchanges can be resummed using operator methods, and cancel at the level of the cross section until at least $O(\alpha^3)$. Furthermore, we argue that both final {\it and} initial state Coulomb exchanges (enhanced by the number of electrons in the atom) do not affect the cross section until at least $O(\alpha^3)$. Transverse photon couplings to non relativistic electrons are proportional to their small velocities, and rotational invariance suppresses their contribution to $O(\alpha^3)$. Our results are relevant for precision experiments involving neutrinos, electrons, positrons, and muons scattering off of atomic electrons in a fixed target.</p>

<p>2024-07-31, <strong>Exploring atmospheric neutrino oscillations at ESSnuSB</strong>, ESSnuSB et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21663v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21663v1</a></p>

<p>This study provides an analysis of atmospheric neutrino oscillations at the ESSnuSB far detector facility. The prospects of the two cylindrical Water Cherenkov detectors with a total fiducial mass of 540 kt are investigated over 10 years of data taking in the standard three-flavor oscillation scenario. We present the confidence intervals for the determination of mass ordering, $\theta_{23}$ octant as well as for the precisions on $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ and $|\Delta m_{31}^2|$. It is shown that mass ordering can be resolved by $3\sigma$ CL ($5\sigma$ CL) after 4 years (10 years) regardless of the true neutrino mass ordering. Correspondingly, the wrong $\theta_{23}$ octant could be excluded by $3\sigma$ CL after 4 years (7 years) in the case where the true neutrino mass ordering is normal ordering (inverted ordering). The results presented in this work are complementary to the accelerator neutrino program in the ESSnuSB project.</p>

<p>2024-07-31, <strong>Neutrino and antineutrino charged-current multi-nucleon cross sections revisited</strong>, J. E. Sobczyk et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21587v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21587v1</a></p>

<p>In this work we improve on several aspects of the computation of the (anti-)neutrino charged-current multi-nucleon cross section carried out in Phys.Rev.C 83 (2011) 045501 and Phys.Rev.C 102 (2020) 024601. Most importantly, we implement a consistent treatment of the nucleon self-energy in the $W^\pm N\to N’\pi$ amplitude entering the definition of the two-particle two-hole (2p2h) cross-section, and estimate the source of uncertainty of our model due to a simplified treatment of the $\Delta$ self-energy. Our new predictions are around $20-40\%$ higher than previously. We show comparisons for the inclusive lepton double-differential cross sections, with no pions in the final state, measured by MiniBooNE on carbon and by T2K on carbon and oxygen. In all cases, we find an excellent reproduction of the experiments, and in particular, the neutrino MiniBooNE data is now well described without requiring a global $90\%$ re-scaling of the flux. In addition, we take the opportunity of this revision to discuss in detail several important issues of the calculation of the 2p2h cross section, delving into the microscopic dynamics of the multi-nucleon mechanisms. The improved treatment presented in this work provides realistic first-step emitted two-nucleon final state momentum configurations, beyond the approximation of phase-space distributions.</p>

<p>2024-07-30, <strong>Investigating the crust of neutron stars with neural-network quantum states</strong>, Bryce Fore et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21207v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21207v1</a></p>

<p>An accurate description of low-density nuclear matter is crucial for explaining the physics of neutron star crusts. In the density range between approximately 0.01 fm$^{-3}$ and 0.1 fm$^{-3}$, matter transitions from neutron-rich nuclei to various higher-density pasta shapes, before ultimately reaching a uniform liquid. In this work, we introduce a variational Monte Carlo method based on a neural Pfaffian-Jastrow quantum state, which allows us to model the transition from the liquid phase to neutron-rich nuclei microscopically. At low densities, nuclear clusters dynamically emerge from the microscopic interactions among protons and neutrons, which we model based on pionless effective field theory. Our variational Monte Carlo approach represents a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo method, which is severely hindered by the fermion-sign problem in this low-density regime and cannot capture the onset of clusters. In addition to computing the energy per particle of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter, we analyze an intermediate isospin-asymmetry configuration to elucidate the formation of nuclear clusters. We also provide evidence that the presence of such nuclear clusters influences the amount of protons in the crust compared to protons in beta-equilibrated, neutrino-transparent matter.</p>

<p>2024-07-30, <strong>The MillenniumTNG Project: Impact of massive neutrinos on the cosmic large-scale structure and the distribution of galaxies</strong>, César Hernández-Aguayo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21103v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21103v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the cold dark matter plus massive neutrinos simulations of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, which aim to improve understanding of how well ongoing and future large-scale galaxy surveys will measure neutrino masses. Our largest simulations, $3000\,{\rm Mpc}$ on a side, use $10240^3$ particles of mass $m_{p} = 6.66\times 10^{8}\,h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$ to represent cold dark matter, and $2560^3$ to represent a population of neutrinos with summed mass $M_\nu = 100\,{\rm meV}$. Smaller volume runs with $\sim 630\,{\rm Mpc}$ also include cases with $M_\nu = 0\,\textrm{and}\, 300\,{\rm meV}$. All simulations are carried out twice using the paired-and-fixed technique for cosmic variance reduction. We evolve the neutrino component using the particle-based $\delta f$ importance sampling method, which greatly reduces shot noise in the neutrino density field. In addition, we modify the GADGET-4 code to account both for the influence of relativistic and mildly relativistic components on the expansion rate and for non-Newtonian effects on the largest represented simulation scales. This allows us to quantify accurately the impact of neutrinos on basic statistical measures of nonlinear structure formation, such as the matter power spectrum and the halo mass function. We use semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to predict the galaxy population and its clustering properties as a function of summed neutrino mass, finding significant ($\sim 10\%$) impacts on the cosmic star formation rate history, the galaxy mass function, and the clustering strength. This offers the prospect of identifying combinations of summary statistics that are optimally sensitive to the neutrino mass.</p>

<p>2024-07-30, <strong>Spin response of neutron matter in ab initio approach</strong>, J. E. Sobczyk et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20986v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.20986v1</a></p>

<p>We propose a general method embedded in the ab initio nuclear framework to reconstruct linear response functions and calculate sum rules. Within our approach, based on the Gaussian integral transform, we consistently treat the groundstate and the excited spectrum. Crucially, the method allows for a robust uncertainty estimation of the spectral reconstruction. We showcase it for the spin response in neutron matter. Our calculations are performed using state-of-the-art many-body coupled-cluster method and Hamiltonians derived in the chiral effective field theory, emphasizing the analysis of finite-size effects. This work serves as a stepping stone towards further studies of neutrino interactions in astrophysical environments from first principles.</p>

<p>2024-07-30, <strong>GeV scale dark matter and $B\rightarrow K+$ missing energy phenomenology in the $U(1)_{B-L}$ model</strong>, Ajay Kumar Yadav et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20974v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.20974v1</a></p>

<p>We elucidate the recently observed discrepancy in the branching ratio of $B^{+}\rightarrow K^{+}$ +inv decay mode using a GeV scale scalar dark matter in an anomaly-free $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge extension of the Standard Model. We constrain the new parameters by using consistency with the existing bounds on Dark matter relic density, direct detection, collider and BR($B\rightarrow K^<em>\nu\bar{\nu}$) measured at the Belle II experiment. We investigate couplings between the mediator and the SM fermions as well as the dark matter particle. We then estimate the branching ratios of $b \to s \nu \bar \nu$ decay processes such as $B\rightarrow (K^+,K^</em>)\nu\bar{\nu}$, $B_s\rightarrow (\eta,\eta’)\nu\bar{\nu}$, $ B_s\rightarrow \phi\nu\bar{\nu}$ and $B_c\rightarrow (D_s, D_s^*)\nu\bar{\nu}$ in a common parameter space, meeting the current experimental bounds of both sectors simultaneously.</p>

<p>2024-07-30, <strong>Track signals at IceCube from subleading channels</strong>, Reinaldo Francener et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20963v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.20963v1</a></p>

<p>Tracks events at the IceCube Observatory are characterized by an energetic muon crossing several kilometers before decaying. Such muons are dominantly produced in charged current (CC) muon neutrino - hadron interactions. However, muons are also produced through the $W$ - boson production and in the decay of tau leptons and heavy mesons created in neutral and charged current interactions induced by all neutrino flavors. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of these subleading channels to events characterized as tracks at the IceCube. Our results indicate that these channels correspond to a non - negligible fraction of the HESE track events. In addition, we show that its contributions are concentrated in muons that are less energetic than those arising from muonic neutrino CC interactions for the same visible energies of the process. Finally, we investigate the impact of these additional channels on the description of the astrophysical neutrino flux, and we find that the inclusion of these subleading processes are important in determining the parameters of the astrophysical neutrino flux.</p>

<p>2024-07-30, <strong>Multi-$Z’$ signatures of spontaneously broken local $U(1)’$ symmetry</strong>, Takaaki Nomura et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20742v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.20742v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss multi-$Z’$ signatures coming from decays of Higgs bosons in models with a spontaneously broken $U(1)’$ symmetry, which can be observed as “lepton jets” or multi-lepton final states depending on the mass range of new bosons. We consider anomaly-free $U(1)’$ models without introducing new fermions except for right-handed neutrinos, in which the Higgs sector is composed of an isospin doublet and a singlet fields with zero and non-zero $U(1)’$ charges, respectively. The multi-$Z’$ signatures can then be obtained via the decays of the discovered (extra) Higgs boson $h$ ($\phi$), i.e., $h\to Z’Z’$, $\phi \to Z’Z’$ and/or $h \to \phi\phi \to 4Z’$ as far as kinematically allowed. We give the upper limit on the branching ratios of $h$ into $Z’Z’$ and $4Z’$ from the current experimental data in each model. We also show the deviation in the $hhh$ coupling from the standard model prediction at one-loop level, and find that its amount is typically smaller than 1\%.</p>

<p>2024-07-30, <strong>Revealing the Origin of Neutrino Masses through Displaced Shower Searches in the CMS Muon System</strong>, Wei Liu et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20676v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.20676v1</a></p>

<p>We study the potential to probe the origin of neutrino masses, by searching for long-lived right-handed neutrinos~(RHNs) $N$ in the $B-L$ gauge model. Despite the small active-sterile mixing $|V_{\ell N}|^2$, RHNs are produced abundantly via SM and exotic Higgs production, as long as the Higgs mixing is sufficiently large. We reinterpret a search for displaced showers in the CMS muon system and we find that it is sensitive to parameter space at and below the canonical seesaw floor, $|V_{\ell N}|^2 \approx 10^{-12}$ ($\ell = e$, $\tau$) for $m_N \approx 40$ GeV. With existing data constraining such a well-motivated scenario of neutrino mass generation, we determine the projected sensitivity at the HL-LHC, motivating dedicated searches for long-lived RHNs with decay lengths $\approx 10$ m.</p>

<p>2024-07-30, <strong>Prospects of five-dimensional $L_μ-L_τ$ gauge interactions in the light of elastic neutrino-electron scatterings: the scope of the DUNE near detector</strong>, Dibyendu Chakraborty et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20615v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.20615v1</a></p>

<p>We discuss the future prospects of a minimally five-dimensional version of the well-motivated scenario for addressing the discrepancy in the muon anomalous magnetic moment, the $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ extension of the standard model (SM) gauge symmetry. Here, multiple associated massive gauge bosons appear thanks to the five-dimensional $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ gauge symmetry, and they contribute to the muon $(g-2)$ and also other processes. We focus on the powerful probe of elastic neutrino-electron scatterings since the upcoming DUNE experiment will explore MeV-scale uncharted regions by previous experiments (e.g., CHARM-II and Borexino) in the near future. We found that even with small kinetic mixing parameters, much of the parameter space, including those satisfying muon $(g-2)$, can be probed using several years of data from the DUNE experiment, focusing on the near detector. In our scenario, interference effects between intermediate-state gauge bosons play an important role. Our results include comparisons between flat and warped extra dimensions.</p>

<p>2024-07-30, <strong>Inspecting neutrino flavor instabilities during proto-neutron star cooling phase in supernova: I. Spherically symmetric model</strong>, Masamichi Zaizen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20548v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.20548v1</a></p>

<p>In the standard model of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), all neutrinos are assumed to be in pure flavor eigenstates in CCSN cores, but the assumption becomes invalid if neutrino distributions are unstable to flavor conversions. In this paper, we present a study of the occurrences of two representative neutrino-flavor instabilities, fast- and collisional flavor instabilities, in the cooling phase of proto-neutron star (PNS) from 1- to 50 seconds. We follow the long-term evolution of a PNS under spherically symmetric and quasi-static approximations, in which the matter profile is determined by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation with neutrino feedback under the treatment of multi-group flux limited diffusion. For the stability analysis of neutrino flavor conversions, we recompute neutrino distributions using Monte Carlo transport in order to obtain the full angular distribution needed to compute the dispersion relations. We find no signs of flavor conversions in our models; the physical reason is thoroughly investigated. We also argue that the negative conclusion in flavor conversions could be changed qualitatively if multi-dimensional effects are included, as similar to cases in the earlier phase of CCSN.</p>

<p>2024-07-30, <strong>Neutrino Oscillation Effects on the Luminosity of Neutrino-Dominated Accretion Flows Around Black Holes</strong>, Chitipat Deesamer et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20507v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.20507v1</a></p>

<p>The stellar-mass black hole surrounded by the neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) is proposed to be the central engine of the gamma-ray burst (GRB). In this work, we investigate the neutrino/anti-neutrino luminosity and annihilation luminosity from the NDAF and pair-annihilation model, taking into account the neutrino oscillation above the accretion disk. The disk hydrodynamical properties are modelled using the empirical solution previously derived with boundary conditions including the effect of electron degeneracy and neutrino trapping. Our key parameters are the mass accretion rate and the black hole spin given in the range of $\dot{M} = 0.1$ - $10$ $M_\odot$ s$^{-1}$ and $ 0 \le a &lt; 1$, respectively. Without neutrino oscillation, the obtained neutrino/anti-neutrino luminosity is $\sim 10^{51}$ - $10^{53}$ $\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$, while the neutrino annihilation luminosity is found to be $\sim 10^{46}$ - $10^{51}$ $\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$. In the presence of neutrino oscillation in the vacuum limit, the electron neutrino annihilation luminosity decreases by $\lesssim 22\%$ through the flavor transformation, while the muon- and tau-neutrino luminosity can increase up to $\sim 45\%$ and $ 60\%$, respectively. As a result, the total annihilation luminosity can be reduced up to $\sim 19\%$ due to the oscillation process above the disk. Finally, we also investigate the case whereby the CP-violating phase is changed from $\delta \textrm{CP} =$ $0^{\circ}$ to $245^{\circ}$. However, our results reveal that the CP-violating phase has minimal impact on neutrino annihilation luminosity.</p>

<p>2024-07-31, <strong>First measurement of the triaxiality of the inner dark matter halo of the Milky Way</strong>, Hanneke C. Woudenberg et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21790v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21790v1</a></p>

<p>Stellar streams are particularly sensitive probes of the mass distribution of galaxies. In this work, we focus on the Helmi Streams, the remnants of an accreted dwarf galaxy orbiting the inner Milky Way. We examine in depth their peculiar dynamical properties, and use these to provide tight constraints on the Galactic potential, and specifically on its dark matter halo in the inner 20 kpc. We extract 6D phase-space information for the Helmi Streams from Gaia DR3, and confirm that the Streams split up into two clumps in angular momentum space, and that these depict different degrees of phase-mixing. To explain these characteristics we explore a range of Galactic potential models with a triaxial NFW halo, further constrained by rotation curve data. We find that a Galactic potential with a mildly triaxial dark matter halo, having $p=1.013^{+0.006}_{-0.006}$, $q=1.204^{+0.032}_{-0.036}$, $M_{\rm{discs}}=4.65^{+0.47}_{-0.57}\cdot10^{10} M_{\odot}$ and $M_{\rm{DM}}(&lt; 15 \text{kpc})=1.14^{+0.11}_{-0.10}\cdot10^{11} M_{\odot}$, is required to form two clumps in angular momentum space over time. Their formation is driven by the fact that the clumps are on different orbital families and close to an orbital resonance. This resonance also explains the different degrees of mixing observed, as well as the presence of a dynamically cold subclump (also known as S2). This first and very precise measurement of the triaxiality of the inner dark matter halo of the Galaxy uniquely reveals the high sensitivity of phase-mixed streams to the exact form of the gravitational potential.</p>

<p>Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) are extremely sensitive magnetic flux sensors which render them useful in a wide array of instrumentation. SQUIDs are often paired with other detectors as a readout mechanism to obtain quantitative insight. SQUIDs have impacted many fields but much less addressed is its impact on the field of fundamental physics, particularly in the search for dark matter. Dark matter is believed to make up around 27% of all mass-energy content of the universe and will provide critical insight into understanding large-scale structures of the universe. Axions and WIMPs are the prominent two dark matter candidates whose search has been fueled by the usage of SQUID read-outs.</p>

<p>The scalar mode describing the fluctuation of the 3-brane (the observable universe) in a five-dimensional bulk spacetime compactified on a circle is absorbed by the Kaluza-Klein U(1) gauge field, leading to a massive brane-vector living on the 3-brane. The brane-vector can be responsible for dark matter because it is odd under a $\mathrm{Z}_2$ symmetry, neutral under the Standard Model (SM) symmetries, and couples extremely weak to the SM particles due to its gravitational origin. Interestingly, the brane-vector dark matter could leave particular imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the primordial gravitational waves. Hence, the precise measurements of the CMB and the observations of the primordial gravitational waves generated during the inflation can provide a potential way to probe the extra-dimensions and branes which are the main ingredients of string/M theory.</p>

<p>A novel proposal linking the origin of supermassive blackhole formation and ultralight dark matter.

<p>We discuss the interplay between dark matter, leptogenesis and a new gauge boson $Z^\prime$ in the $B-L$ model. A fermion dark matter $\chi$ carrying $U(1)_{B-L}$ charge is introduced to the model but not coupling with other particles. We consider the freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms, and obtain the correct relic density respectively. We have scanned the feasible parameter space and found that the dark matter direct detection experiments imposed the most stringent constraints on the parameter space. The constraint on the parameter space places a limit on the mass of dark matter with $m_{\chi} \approx 1/2 M_{Z’}$ within a narrow region in the case of freeze-out scenario, and we can obtain the right baryon asymmetry result in the case of $m_{\chi}\subset[654$ GeV, 664 GeV]. For the freeze-in scenario, we have a much broader parameter space for $m_{\chi}$ and $M_{Z^\prime}$ but $g_{BL}$ is restricted at $10^{-5}$ level for $Q=0.1$. In both scenarios, $g_{BL}-M_{Z^\prime}$ is limited within a narrow region by the dark matter relic density, direct detection and baryon asymmetry constraints.</p>

<p>A Bose star passing through cold molecular clouds may capture atoms, molecules and dust particles. The observational signature of such an event would be a relatively small amount of matter that is gravitationally bound. This binding may actually be provided by invisible dark matter forming the Bose star. We may expect a relative excess of heavier atoms, molecules, and solid dust compared to the content of giant cold molecular clouds since the velocity of heavy particles at a given temperature is lower and it may be small compared to the escape velocity, $v_\mathrm{rms} = \sqrt{3k_\mathrm{B} T/m_\mathrm{gas}} \ll v_\mathrm{esc}=\sqrt{2GM/R}$. Finally, the velocity of this captured matter cloud may correlate with the expected velocity of free dark matter particles (e.g. expected axion wind velocity relative to Earth).</p>

<p>Dark sectors provide beyond Standard Model scenarios which can address unresolved puzzles, such as the observed dark matter abundance or the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. A naturally small portal to the dark sector is obtained if dark-sector interactions stem from a non-Abelian hidden gauge group that couples through kinetic mixing with the hypercharge boson. In this work, we investigate the phenomenology of such a portal of dimension five in the presence of CP violation, focusing on its signatures in fermion electric dipole moments. We show that, currently unbounded regions of the parameter space from dark photon searches can be indirectly probed with upcoming electron dipole moment experiments for dark boson masses in the range $1-100$ GeV. We also discuss two particular scenarios where a $SU(2)_D$ dark gauge group spontaneously breaks into either an Abelian $U(1)_D$ or nothing. In both cases, we show that potentially observable electron dipole moments can be produced in vast regions of the parameter space compatible with current experimental constraints and observed dark matter abundance.</p>

<p>We show that dark matter direct detection experiments are sensitive to the existence of particles with a small effective charge (for instance, via couplings to a kinetically mixed, low-mass dark photon). Our forecasts do not depend on these particles comprising a significant fraction of the dark matter. Rather, these experiments are sensitive to the irreducible abundance produced in the early universe through the freeze-in mechanism. We find that ongoing and proposed direct detection experiments will have world-leading sensitivity to effective charges $Q\sim 10^{-12}$ across nine orders of magnitude in mass, corresponding to a dark matter sub-fraction as low as $\sim 10^{-3}$.</p>

<p>The 3C 220.3 system is a rare case of a foreground narrow-line radio galaxy (“galaxy A,” $z_A = 0.6850$) lensing a background submillimeter galaxy ($z_ = 2.221$). New spectra from MMT/Binospec confirm that the companion galaxy (“galaxy B”) is part of the lensing system with $z_B = 0.6835$. New three-color HST data reveal a full Einstein ring and allow a more precise lens model. The new HST images also reveal extended emission around galaxy A, and the spectra show extended [OII] emission with irregular morphology and complex velocity structure. All indications are that the two lensing galaxies are a gravitationally interacting pair. Strong [OII] emission from both galaxies A and B suggests current star formation, which could be a consequence of the interaction. This would indicate a younger stellar population than previously assumed and imply smaller stellar masses for the same luminosity. The improved lens model and expanded spectral energy distributions have enabled better stellar-mass estimates for the foreground galaxies. The resulting dark matter fractions are ~0.8, higher than previously calculated. Deeper Chandra imaging shows extended X-ray emission but no evidence for a point X-ray source associated with either galaxy. The detection of X-rays from the radio lobes of 3C 220.3 allows an estimate of ~3 nT for the magnetic fields in the lobes, a factor of ~3 below the equipartition fields, as typical for radio galaxies.</p>

<p>We carry out a Bayesian analysis of dark matter (DM) direct detection data to determine particle model parameters using the Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE) machine learning technique. TMNRE avoids an explicit calculation of the likelihood, which instead is estimated from simulated data, unlike in traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. This considerably speeds up, by several orders of magnitude, the computation of the posterior distributions, which allows to perform the Bayesian analysis of an otherwise computationally prohibitive number of benchmark points. In this article we demonstrate that, in the TMNRE framework, it is possible to include, combine, and remove different datasets in a modular fashion, which is fast and simple as there is no need to re-train the machine learning algorithm or to define a combined likelihood. In order to assess the performance of this method, we consider the case of WIMP DM with spin-dependent and independent interactions with protons and neutrons in a xenon experiment. After validating our results with MCMC, we employ the TMNRE procedure to determine the regions where the DM parameters can be reconstructed. Finally, we present CADDENA, a Python package that implements the modular Bayesian analysis of direct detection experiments described in this work.</p>

<p>We explore the science prospects of a 14,000 deg$^2$ Kinematic Lensing (KL) survey with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and overlapping imaging surveys. KL infers the cosmic shear signal by jointly forward modeling the observed photometric image and velocity field of a disk galaxy. The latter can be constrained by placing multiple DESI fibers along the galaxy’s major and minor axis, a concept similar to the DESI Peculiar Velocity Survey. We study multiple subset galaxy samples of the DESI Legacy Survey Data Release 9 catalog and quantify the residual shape noise, $\sigma_\epsilon$, of each sample as a function of cuts in $r$-band magnitude using mock observations. We conduct simulated likelihood analyses for these galaxy samples and find that a DESI-KL program can place highly interesting constraints on structure formation at very low redshifts, i.e. $\sigma_8(z&lt;0.15)$. We conclude that if the $S_8$ tension consolidates as a phenomenon, a DESI-KL survey can provide unique insights into this phenomenon in the very late-time Universe. Given the different footprints of DESI and Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), lensing results from both surveys are highly complementary and can be combined into a joint lensing survey. We further note that DESI-KL benefits multiple additional science cases, e.g. studies of modified gravity models when combined with peculiar velocity surveys, and dark matter studies that are based on galaxy-galaxy lensing of dwarf galaxies.</p>

<p>We study and classify $SU(5)$-GUT completions of accidental composite dark matter models. These theories postulate new vectorlike confining dark color dynamics and give an accidentally stable baryonic dark matter candidate. In realistic theories, dark fermion $SU(5)$ irreps split into light dark quarks, whose bound states include the dark matter, and their much heavier GUT partners. A simple analysis shows that such a mass hierarchy requires a fine tuning of parameters and thus implies a naturalness problem. We select theories requiring that all dangerous metastable states decay before the onset of nucleosynthesis through higher-dimensional operators generated at the GUT scale or at the mass scale of dark quark GUT partners. Demanding Standard Model gauge coupling unification puts severe constraints on the landscape of viable theories. Under the assumption of an approximately degenerate spectrum of dark quark GUT partners, we find that only one model gives precision unification.</p>

<p>Stellar tidal streams are a key tracer of galaxy evolution and have the potential to provide an indirect means for tracing dark matter. For the Local Group, many diffuse substructures have been identified and their link to galaxy evolution has been traced. However, an analysis of a larger sample is required to better probe the frequency and characteristics of these streams to verify the predictions of the Lambda-CDM model and its implementation in cosmological simulations. For that purpose, we are carrying out the first systematic survey of faint stellar debris from tidally disrupted dwarf satellites around nearby galaxies up to a distance of 100 Mpc. In this paper, we present a catalogue with the results of the first harvest of stellar tidal streams found by visual inspection in deep images of ~ 700 galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We include a photometric characterisation of the streams obtained by measuring their surface brightnesses and colours. We found a total of 63 streams in our sample at distances between 40 and 100 Mpc, including 59 which were not previously reported. We measured their average surface brightness for the grz bands, to be 28.35+/-0.20, 27.81+/-0.13 and 27.62+/-0.09 mag arcsec^-2, respectively. By applying a statistical analysis to our findings, we obtained a stream detection frequency of 9.1% +/- 1.1% , in agreement with previous studies. We identified stream progenitors in 5-14% of our stream sample, depending on the confidence level. The first catalogue of streams in the Local Universe presented here will be complemented by future stream surveys within the Stellar Stream Legacy Survey. In this work we have learnt that the faintest measured stream surface brightness can be significantly brighter than the surface brightness limit of an image measured at pixel level, mainly due to correlated noise present in the images.</p>

<p>We investigate the spectroscopic characteristics of Intermediate Luminosity Red Transients (ILRTs), a class of elusive objects with peak luminosity between that of classical novae and standard supernovae. We present the extensive optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic monitoring of four ILRTs, namely NGC 300 2008OT-1, AT 2019abn, AT 2019ahd and AT 2019udc. First we focus on the evolution of the most prominent spectral features observed in the low resolution spectra, then we discuss more in detail the high resolution spectrum collected for NGC 300 2008OT-1 with the Very Large Telescope equipped with UVES. Finally we analyse late time spectra of NGC 300 2008OT-1 and AT 2019ahd through comparisons with both synthetic and observed spectra. Balmer and Ca lines dominate the optical spectra, revealing the presence of slowly moving circumstellar medium (CSM) around the objects. The line luminosity of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Ca II NIR triplet presents a double peaked evolution with time, possibly indicative of interaction between fast ejecta and the slow CSM. The high resolution spectrum of NGC 300 2008OT-1 reveals a complex circumstellar environment, with the transient being surrounded by a slow ($\sim$30 km s$^{-1}$) progenitor wind. At late epochs, optical spectra of NGC 300 2008OT-1 and AT 2019ahd show broad ($\sim$2500 km s$^{-1}$) emission features at $\sim$6170 A and $\sim$7000 A which are unprecedented for ILRTs. We find that these lines originate most likely from the blending of several narrow lines, possibly of iron-peak elements.</p>

<p>2024-07-31, <strong>A study in scarlet – I. Photometric properties of a sample of Intermediate Luminosity Red Transients</strong>, G. Valerin et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21671v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.21671v1</a></p>

<p>We investigate the photometric characteristics of a sample of Intermediate Luminosity Red Transients (ILRTs), a class of elusive objects with peak luminosity between that of classical novae and standard supernovae. We present the multi-wavelength photometric follow-up of four ILRTs, namely NGC 300 2008OT-1, AT 2019abn, AT 2019ahd and AT 2019udc. Through the analysis and modelling of their spectral energy distribution and bolometric light curves we infer the physical parameters associated with these transients. All four objects display a single peaked light curve which ends in a linear decline in magnitudes at late phases. A flux excess with respect to a single black body emission is detected in the infrared domain for three objects in our sample, a few months after maximum. This feature, commonly found in ILRTs, is interpreted as a sign of dust formation. Mid infrared monitoring of NGC 300 2008OT-1 761 days after maximum allows us to infer the presence of $\sim$10$^{-3}$-10$^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ of dust, depending on the chemical composition and the grain size adopted. The late time decline of the bolometric light curves of the considered ILRTs is shallower than expected for $^{56}$Ni decay, hence requiring an additional powering mechanism. James Webb Space Telescope observations of AT 2019abn prove that the object has faded below its progenitor luminosity in the mid-infrared domain, five years after its peak. Together with the disappearance of NGC 300 2008OT-1 in Spitzer images seven years after its discovery, this supports the terminal explosion scenario for ILRTs. With a simple semi-analytical model we try to reproduce the observed bolometric light curves in the context of few M$_{\odot}$ of material ejected at few 10$^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$ and enshrouded in an optically thick circumstellar medium.</p>

<p>2024-07-30, <strong>Neutron star kicks plus rockets as a mechanism for forming wide low-eccentricity neutron star binaries</strong>, Ryosuke Hirai et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20967v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.20967v1</a></p>

<p>Recent neutron star surface observations corroborate a long-standing theory that neutron stars may be accelerated over extended periods after their birth. We analyze how these prolonged rocket-like accelerations, combined with rapid birth kicks, impact binary orbits. We find that even a small contribution of rocket kicks combined with instantaneous natal kicks can allow binaries to reach period–eccentricity combinations unattainable in standard binary evolution models. We propose these kick + rocket combinations as a new channel to form wide low-eccentricity neutron star binaries such as Gaia NS1, as well as inducing stellar mergers months to years after a supernova to cause peculiar high-energy transients.</p>

<p>2024-07-30, <strong>Supernova Polarization Signals From the Interaction with a Dense Circumstellar Disk</strong>, Xudong Wen et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20720v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2407.20720v1</a></p>

<p>There is increasing evidence that massive stars may exhibit an enhanced mass loss shortly before their termination explosion. Some of them also indicate the enhancement of their circumstellar matter (CSM) is not spherically symmetric. Supernova (SN) interacting with aspherical CSM could induce special polarization signals from multiple radiation components that deviate from spherical symmetry. We investigate the time-evolution of the continuum polarization induced by the SN ejecta interacting with a disk/torus-like CSM. Our calculation suggests that the interaction between the SN ejecta and an immediate disk-like CSM with a thin, homogenous density structure would produce a high continuum polarization, which may reach a peak level of $\sim$15\%. The interplay between the evolving geometry of the emitting regions and the time-variant flux ratio between the polar ejecta and the equatorial CSM interaction may produce a double-peaked feature in the polarization time sequence. A similar trend of the time evolution of the polarization is also found for a radially extended CSM disk that exhibits a wind-like density structure, with an overall relatively lower level of continuum polarization ($&lt;2.5\%$) during the interaction process. We also identify a non-uniform temperature distribution along the radial direction of the CSM disk, which yields a strong wavelength dependence of the continuum polarization. These signatures provide a unique geometric diagnostic to explore the interaction process and the associated extreme mass loss of the progenitors of interacting transients.</p>
