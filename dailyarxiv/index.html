<p>2026-02-18, <strong>Quantum Estimation Theory Limits in Neutrino Oscillation Experiments</strong>, Claudia Frugiuele et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16534v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.16534v1</a></p>

<p>Measurements of the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) neutrino mixing parameters have entered a precision era, enabling increasingly stringent tests of neutrino oscillations. Within the framework of quantum estimation theory, we investigate whether flavor measurements, the only observables currently accessible experimentally, are optimal for extracting the oscillation parameters. We compute the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and the classical Fisher Information (FI) associated with ideal flavor projections for all oscillation parameters, considering accelerator muon (anti)neutrino and reactor electron antineutrino beams propagating in vacuum. Two main results emerge. First, flavor measurements saturate the QFI at the first oscillation maximum for $θ_{13}$, $θ_{23}$, and $θ_{12}$, demonstrating their information-theoretic optimality for these parameters. In contrast, they are far from optimal for $δ_{CP}$. In particular, only a small fraction of the available information on $δ_{CP}$ is extracted at the first maximum; the sensitivity improves at the second maximum, in line with the strategy of ESS$ν$SB, a planned facility. Second, the QFI associated with $δ_{CP}$ is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than that of the mixing angles, indicating that the neutrino state intrinsically encodes less information about CP violation. Nevertheless, this quantum bound lies well below current experimental uncertainties, implying that the present precision on $δ_{CP}$ is not fundamentally limited. Our results provide a quantitative framework to disentangle fundamental from practical limitations and establish a benchmark for optimizing future neutrino facilities.</p>

<p>2026-02-18, <strong>Atmospheric Neutrino Charged-Current Interactions at Large Liquid-Scintillator Detectors: I. Physics of Neutrino-Antineutrino Discrimination</strong>, Xinhai He et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16514v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.16514v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we present a systematic study of the event characteristics and physics of neutrino-antineutrino discrimination associated with atmospheric neutrino charged-current interactions in large liquid scintillator detectors. This study encompasses the primary neutrino interactions, the sequential second interactions of final-state particles, and the final neutron captures. We carefully investigate the properties of final-state charged leptons and hadrons, providing distinct distributions of inelasticity and captured neutron multiplicity for both neutrino and antineutrino interactions. These distributions are employed to assess the quantitative performance of neutrino-antineutrino discrimination. Our findings lay the groundwork for atmospheric neutrino oscillation studies in large liquid scintillator detectors, particularly in the determination of neutrino mass ordering.</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>Evolution of Low-Mass Population III Stars: Convection, Mass Loss, Nucleosynthesis, and Neutrinos</strong>, Thiago Ferreira et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16082v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.16082v1</a></p>

<p>The first stars likely formed from pristine clouds, marking a transformative epoch after the dark ages by initiating reionisation and synthesising the first heavy elements. Among these, low-mass Population III stars are of particular interest, as their long lifespans raise the possibility that some may survive to the present day in the Milky Way’s stellar halo or satellite dwarfs. As the first paper in a series, we present hydrodynamic evolutionary models for 0.7 - 1 MSun stars evolved up to the white dwarf phase, utilising the MESA software instrument. We systematically vary mass-loss efficiencies, convective transport, and overshooting prescriptions, thereby mapping how uncertain physics influences nucleosynthetic yields; surface enrichment, including nitrogen-rich post-main sequence stars arising from convective shell mergers; remnant properties, such as low-mass helium or carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (M_WD ~ 0.45-0.55 MSun) and transient UV-bright phases; and potential observational signatures, including neutrino emission during shell mergers and helium flashes. These models establish a predictive framework for identifying surviving Pop III stars and their descendants, providing both evolutionary and observational constraints that were previously unexplored.</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>Towards the inclusion of NLO EW corrections in the MiNLO method in Drell-Yan processes</strong>, Filippo Belloni et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16029v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.16029v1</a></p>

<p>In this paper we present the first application of the MiNLO method to the calculation of QED NLO corrections to the production of a neutral vector boson in Drell-Yan processes. We consider only the case of initial-state radiation, when the Z boson decays into neutrinos. We illustrate the abelianization procedure of the MiNLO formulae and discuss the impact that it has on the differential cross section. We then propose a variant of the MiNLO formulae in order to circumvent some of the problems that arise when dealing with QED emissions. Since this is a case study, we use ad-hoc parton distribution functions and a larger value of the electromagnetic coupling constant, in order to emphasize potential discrepancies with respect to the expected behavior of the MiNLO formulae. We quantify the uncertainties connected with the proposed method, also for a the physical value of the electromagnetic coupling. The study presented here is a necessary first step towards incorporating full electroweak effects into the MiNNLOPS framework.</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>Detecting the neutrino mass via the cross-correlation between matter tracers and the ISWRS effect?</strong>, Viviana Cuozzo et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15688v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15688v1</a></p>

<p>This work explores the potential to detect the nonlinear Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect, namely the Rees-Sciama effect (ISWRS), by cross-correlating current and future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments – Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, CMB-HD, and PICO – with ongoing Large Scale Structure (LSS) surveys, such as Euclid and the Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST). We model the cross-correlation of the ISWRS effect with gravitational potential tracers like galaxy clustering, cosmic shear, and CMB-lensing potential, to forecast results from these experiments. Our analysis also accounts for the presence of massive neutrinos to assess the feasibility of identifying the $ν\(Λ$CDM model and constraining the neutrino mass sum, M$ν$. Our findings indicate that the CMB-lensing potential reconstructed by CMB-HD is expected to provide the most promising results, achieving $\gtrsim$ 5$σ$ detections even under conservative assumptions for detector noise and foregrounds, thereby allowing differentiation between $ν\)Λ$CDM models. Galaxy clustering can also yield significant detections, whereas cosmic shear can provide valuable results only if non-linearities are accurately modelled, beyond the capabilities of currently available analytical approaches. These latter LSS probes do not provide strong constraining power on M$ν$. While our findings suggest that future CMB experiments and LSS surveys will enable the detection of the ISWRS effect, they do not imply significant prospects for imposing new constraints on neutrino masses in the near future.</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>The COHERENT Experiment: 2026 Update</strong>, M. Adhikari et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15652v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15652v1</a></p>

<p>The COHERENT experiment measures neutrino-induced recoils from coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) with multiple nuclear targets at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), USA. Several successful CEvNS measurements have been achieved in recent years with tens-of-kg detector masses, with a CsI scintillating crystal, a liquid argon single-phase detector, and high-purity germanium spectrometers. For the next phase, COHERENT aims at high-statistics detection of CEvNS events for precision tests of the standard model of particle physics, and to probe new physics beyond-the-standard model. Percent-level precision can be achieved by lowering thresholds, reducing backgrounds, and by scaling up the detector masses. It goes hand in hand with benchmarking the neutrino flux from the SNS. Further detectors will measure CEvNS in additional nuclei, including lighter target nuclei such as sodium and neon, to continue to test the expected neutron-number-squared dependence of the cross section. COHERENT can furthermore study charged-current and neutral-current inelastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections on various nuclei at neutrino energies below $\sim$50 MeV. Many of these cross sections have never been measured before, but are critical input for the interpretation of core-collapse supernova detection in large-scale neutrino experiments such as DUNE, Super-K, Hyper-K, and HALO.</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>Bayesian parameter study of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 7469</strong>, Björn Eichmann et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15644v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15644v1</a></p>

<p>Multimessenger observation of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 7469 indicate a characteristic feature in the radio band (the so-called mm-bump) as well as indication of high-energy neutrinos by the AGN corona. Moreover, also the starburst ring of these sources is bright in the radio and hence, a potential source of $γ$-rays and neutrinos.   We aim to explain the non-thermal features of these two sources with our homogeneous steady-state Seyfert-starburst composite model, which we refined in this work. Hereby, we account for stochastic diffuse acceleration and energy losses within the corona and $γγ$-pair attenuation of the escaping $γ$-rays. Since the non-thermal features of Seyfert sources contribute only marginally to the electromagnetic spectrum, only few data points can be assigned to the starburst ring or the AGN corona. Hence, prior information on the physical parameters is incorporated within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to avoid overfitting.   Based on this Bayesian parameter study we show, that the non-thermal features of NGC 1068 can be explained well. Still a more detailed treatment of the spatial inhomogeneities in the central region of the AGN could further improve the fit results. This manifests itself even more clearly in the case of NGC 7469, where the mm-bump needs to emerge from a coronal size $R_{\rm c}&gt;100\,\mathcal{R}_{\rm s}$, whereas (TeV-PeV)-neutrino emission requires $R_{\rm c}&lt; 10\,\mathcal{R}_{\rm s}$. Similar to what has previously been shown in other wavebands, our analysis highlights that the spatial extension of the so-called AGN corona depends the considered energy of the messenger. Hence, it seems that there is not a unique edge of the corona and a substantial progress in the understanding of these phenomena is expected if future analysis account for these spatial inhomogeneities.</p>

<p>2026-02-18, <strong>Dynamic effects of external axion fields in a system of many particles with spin</strong>, Mariya Iv. Trukhanova et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16627v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.16627v1</a></p>

<p>We develop the theoretical model that describes dynamic non-equilibrium effects of external inertial and axion fields in a system of particles with spin. The possibility of using the spin density and the current density of non-relativistic quantum particle systems for the detection of the hypothetical axion-like dark matter is discussed. The resulting closed system of dynamic equations encompasses the continuity equation, the momentum balance equation, and the spin density evolution equation, accounting for the influence of the spin-rotation coupling and the external axion fields. The new formalism opens up new perspectives for an experimental search of dark matter axions.</p>

<p>2026-02-18, <strong>Chiral gravitational waves from multi-phase magnetogenesis</strong>, H. V. Ragavendra et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16575v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.16575v1</a></p>

<p>Cosmological vector fields are central to many early-Universe phenomena, including inflationary dynamics, primordial magnetogenesis, and dark-matter scenarios. However, constructing models able to generate cosmological magnetic fields while avoiding strong coupling, backreaction, and cosmic microwave background constraints remains challenging. We study a novel mechanism in which brief non–slow-roll phases during inflation amplify primordial magnetic fields at small scales, while maintaining theoretical consistency and observational viability. We incorporate parity-violating interactions in the vector sector and demonstrate, for the first time in a non–slow-roll framework, that chirality can significantly boost magnetic-field amplitudes and imprint distinctive polarization-dependent spectral features. We complement detailed numerical computations with an analytical treatment yielding compact expressions for chiral vector mode functions that reproduce the main spectral properties. We then develop a systematic formalism to evaluate the stochastic gravitational-wave background naturally induced at second order by these amplified fields, identifying both an intensity component and a circularly polarized contribution with characteristic frequency profiles. We discuss detection prospects with future multiband gravitational-wave observatories, showing that chiral signatures could provide a distinctive observational probe. Our results introduce new avenues for enhancing primordial magnetic fields and their associated gravitational-wave signals, opening promising possibilities for their future detection and interpretation, both with cosmological and gravitational wave probes.</p>

<p>2026-02-18, <strong>The Crusts of Neutron Stars Revisited: Approximations within a Polytropic Equation of State Approach</strong>, F. Köpp et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16477v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.16477v1</a></p>

<p>In this work, we revisit several thin-crust approximations presented in the literature and compare them with the exact solutions of the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) equations. In addition, we employ three different equations of state (EoSs), including one with a pasta phase, each based on a distinct theoretical framework: the variational method, relativistic Brueckner–Hartree–Fock theory, and relativistic mean-field theory.   We emphasize that these approximations require only the TOV solutions for the core and the EoS properties at the core–crust interface; in our approach, only the energy density is needed. Finally, the relativistic approximation, as well as the Newtonian approximation with corrections, shows good agreement with the exact solutions. This indicates that a simple treatment of the crust is sufficient for structural purposes, independently of the uncertainties in the sub-nuclear equation of state, which are not very large.   The unified EoS SINPA (relativistic mean-field theory), including the pasta phase, was used to study the thin-crust approximation, while degeneracy in the $M$–$R$ relation is demonstrated through: (i) anisotropic pressure in the modified TOV equations, (ii) the $f(R, L_m, T)$ gravity model, and (iii) dark matter admixture. As demonstrated, modifications to the description of gravitation introduce degeneracies in the mass–radius relation that are challenging to disentangle or quantify precisely.</p>

<p>2026-02-18, <strong>High significance detection at 4.8 GHz of the radio halo in the Coma galaxy cluster with the Sardinia Radio Telescope</strong>, P. Marchegiani et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16364v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.16364v1</a></p>

<p>We present the results of observations of the radio halo in the Coma galaxy cluster at 4.8 GHz performed with the Sardinia Radio Telescope. The radio halo in this cluster is detected for the first time at this frequency with a statistical significance higher than $3σ$. After the removal of the Radio Frequency Interference and of the discrete sources contribution, and after the correction for the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect, we estimate a flux density of $61\pm11$ mJy, higher than the value previously reported in literature at this frequency. By using the value we obtained, it is possible to estimate an integrated spectral index between 4.8 and 6.6 GHz of $α\sim1.17$, where $F(ν)\propto ν^{-α}$, indicating a possible higher-frequency slowdown of the spectral steepening observed between 1.4 and 4.8 GHz. Such a spectral behavior is compatible with turbulent re-acceleration if the seed electrons have a spectrum extending up to high energies, as in the case of continuous injection by hadronic interactions or dark matter annihilation. We also report the detection at 4.8 GHz of a polarized spot inside the halo, without an evident counterpart, already detected at 6.6 GHz.</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>The Carousel Lens II: Cosmological Constraints with GIGA-Lens</strong>, Felipe Urcelay et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16077v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.16077v1</a></p>

<p>The nature of dark matter and dark energy are among the central questions in cosmology. Strong gravitational lenses with multiple source planes provide a geometric probe of cosmology: the ratio of deflection angles at different redshifts depends only on angular-diameter distances, constraining the matter density $Ω_m$ and the dark energy equation of state $w$. However, constraints from this technique have historically lagged behind those from the CMB, SNe Ia, and BAO. In this work, we present new cosmological constraints from the Carousel Lens, a cluster-scale lens with more than 40 extended images from 11 spectroscopically confirmed sources. Its relaxed core and rich set of extended images behind the main halo make it particularly suitable for cosmological inference. Using the GIGA-Lens pipeline, we construct a pixel-level lens model including six HST-detected sources and four mass components. From this model, we obtain $w$CDM constraints of $Ω_m = 0.34^{+0.16}_{-0.13}$ and $w = -1.31^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$ from the Carousel Lens alone, accounting for both statistical and systematic uncertainties. We further project that including four additional known higher-redshift sources, assuming similar fractional uncertainties, could improve the constraining power by ~80%, bringing the precision close to that of the CMB and SNe Ia. For an evolving dark energy model ($w_0w_a$CDM), the Carousel Lens alone yields constraints comparable to the CMB, providing an independent and complementary probe alongside SN Ia and BAO. While currently systematic uncertainties dominate, which we quantify through simulations, our results demonstrate that relaxed multi-source-plane cluster lenses can deliver competitive cosmological constraints. Further improvements are expected from reductions in systematics and from incorporating higher-redshift sources (known and new) with high-resolution imaging.</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>Stellar microlensing as a probe of Primordial Black Holes: status and prospects</strong>, Anne M. Green et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15974v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15974v1</a></p>

<p>Stellar microlensing is a powerful tool for probing dark matter in the form of planetary and stellar mass compact objects (COs), in particular primordial black holes (PBHs). Under standard assumptions, current observations exclude COs in the mass range $10^{-11} \lesssim M/M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{4}$ making up all of the dark matter. We provide an overview, aimed at theorists working on PBHs, of the history, theory, observational status, and future prospects of the field.</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>Novel Constraints on Spin-Dependent Light Dark Matter Scattering</strong>, Alexander Clarke et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15960v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15960v1</a></p>

<p>We explore the sensitivity of the SNO experiment to light dark matter particles $χ$ with spin-dependent interactions with nucleons. We show that the pair-production of MeV scale dark matter is possible in heavy water (CANDU) reactors via ${\rm D}(n,χ\barχ)^3{\rm He}$, and calculate the expected rate within the simplest models of $χ$-nucleon interactions. %Heavy water nuclear reactors serve as an excellent production method for spin-dependent dark matter. Owing to a sizable $Q$-value for this reaction, a large fraction of DM particles produced this way are above the threshold for deuteron disintegration, ${\rm D}(χ,χ)np$, which adds to the SNO neutral current signal. Evaluating the CANDU-to-SNO scheme for the production and detection of DM, we derive novel constraints for the $χ$-nucleon spin-dependent cross sections, showing that cross sections above $σ_{χp} \sim 10^{-33}\,{\rm cm}^{2}$ are generally excluded if $m_χ\leq1.5$\,MeV. An isospin-mirror reaction will occur in the Sun, and for the kinematically allowed region it excludes a portion of parameter space with cross sections on the order $10^{-37}\,{\rm cm}^{2}$. We also evaluate the potential sensitivity of small ``near” detectors placed in close proximity to a CANDU reactor to search for a coherent nuclear recoil, finding subdominant sensitivity.</p>

<p>The time-dependent modulation of the event rate in dark matter direct detection experiments, arising from the motion of the Earth with respect to the Galactic rest frame, is a distinctive signature whose observation is crucial for claiming a discovery of dark matter. While annual modulation has been well studied for decades, daily modulation due to the Earth’s rotation has attracted increased attention recently due to the identification of anisotropic solid-state detector materials that yield a direction-dependent scattering rate without sacrificing the overall rate. We perform a statistical analysis of daily modulation in dark matter scattering experiments, with the goal of maximizing the statistical significance of a modulating signal in the presence of an unknown background rate, which may be either flat (non-modulating), or modulating over a 24-hour period with a known or unknown phase. In the background-dominated regime, we find that the discovery significance scales as $f_\text{RMS} \sqrt{T}$, where $T$ is the total exposure time and $f_\text{RMS}$ is the root-mean-square modulation amplitude; in particular, the significance continues to improve with exposure rather than saturating due to systematic uncertainties in the background rate. Using anisotropic trans-stilbene detectors for sub-GeV dark matter as a benchmark example, we provide prescriptions for optimizing the significance for a given total detector mass and location. In an example analysis using three detectors, optimizing the detector orientations can reduce the required exposure by a factor of $\sim 5$ for a desired discovery or exclusion significance, even after profiling over an unknown modulating background phase.</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>The large cores of dark matter and globular clusters in AS1063. Possible evidence of self-interacting dark matter. Or not</strong>, Jose M. Diego et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15940v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15940v1</a></p>

<p>Deep JWST images of AS1063 reveals tens of thousands of globular clusters in the galaxy cluster AS1063. When compared with the lensing model based on the same JWST data, the distribution of globular clusters traces closely the distribution of lensing mass (mostly composed of dark matter). Interestingly, both the distributions of dark matter and globular clusters have large central cores. However the size of the core in the distribution of globular clusters is about half the size the core of the dark matter distribution. We argue that the standard cold dark matter and fuzzy dark matter models struggle to explain these large cores. Meanwhile, the self interacting dark matter with a velocity dependent cross section, combined with core stalling, offers a natural explanation to the existence of these cores if $σ_{\rm SI}\approx 0.3$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$ for galaxy cluster halos. But we also discuss how the lack of hydrodynamical N-body simulations capable of resolving globular clusters in galaxy cluster scale halos, hinders the possibility of ruling out the standard non-collisional dark matter scenario. Future high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, with several trillion particles, and containing over a hundred thousand globular clusters, can provide the insight needed to transform the epistemic nature of dark matter into an ontological one</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>Searching for Axion-like particle Dark Matter with Time-domain Polarization: Constraints from a protoplanetary disk</strong>, Kanako Narita et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15611v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15611v1</a></p>

<p>Axion-like particles (ALPs) can induce a birefringence effect that rotates the polarization angle of light, offering a probe of ultralight dark matter. We analyze archival near-infrared polarimetric data of the protoplanetary disk (PPD) around HD 163296. Whereas previous studies considered only single-epoch snapshots, we perform a consistent multi-epoch time-series analysis, extracting the polarization angle and its uncertainty from the polarized images. The resulting six-epoch time series is consistent with a constant polarization angle within the measurement uncertainties, while being sensitive to timescales of $\sim 170-400$ days. The typical polarization angle uncertainties are $1.6$–$6.4$ degrees, partly driven by multiple scattering in the optically thick disk, which broadens the intrinsic polarization angle distribution and introduces additional dispersion in the representative polarization angle. Based on these data, we derive the first upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling from PPD polarization variability, $g_{aγ} \lesssim 7.5 \times 10^{-12} (m_a / 10^{-22}\,{\rm eV})\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$. Furthermore, we forecast that achieving a polarization angle uncertainty of $σ\sim 0.1$ degrees would enable world-leading sensitivity to ALP-induced birefringence.</p>

<p>We investigate quantum and classical signatures of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a Hernquist dark matter halo. Starting from the exact spherically symmetric solution describing this composite system, we analyze particle production for both bosonic and fermionic fields using semiclassical techniques. Hawking radiation is derived through Bogoliubov transformations and independently via the tunneling method with energy conservation, allowing us to identify the effective temperature, emission spectrum, and the role of dark matter parameters in suppressing particle creation. The evaporation process is examined in the high-frequency regime, leading to modified evaporation times and emission rates relative to the vacuum Schwarzschild case. We further study absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves employing a partial-wave analysis, computing phase shifts, partial and total cross sections, and assessing the impact of the Hernquist scale radius and density on these observables. Finally, null and timelike geodesics are explored to characterize light propagation and particle motion in the presence of the dark matter halo.</p>

<p>2026-02-18, <strong>Updated Constraints on Infrared Cutoff Models and Implications for Large-Scale CMB Anomalies</strong>, Ujjwal Upadhyay et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16659v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.16659v1</a></p>

<p>The nearly scale-invariant primordial power spectrum provides the standard initial conditions for cosmological perturbations. However, the largest scales remain only weakly constrained by CMB observations, leaving room for deviations such as an infrared (IR) cut-off. This possibility is further motivated by the persistence of large-scale CMB anomalies, most notably the low quadrupole power. In this work, we revisit several broad classes of phenomenologically motivated IR cut-off scenarios using parametrised functional forms of the primordial power spectrum. We confront these models with the latest CMB, BAO, and supernova data and derive updated constraints on the cut-off scale and associated features. Our results remain consistent with earlier studies, showing that although such models suppress power at low multipoles, the improvement in fit is marginal and does not overcome the associated parameter penalties. We therefore find no statistically significant evidence favouring IR cut-off models over the standard power-law spectrum with current data. We further explore the interplay between IR cut-off features and a possible increase in the reionisation optical depth, motivated by the recent CMB-BAO tension highlighted by DESI DR2 within the $Λ$CDM framework. We show that the additional freedom introduced by large-scale suppression is generally insufficient to support a substantial increase in optical depth, owing to the weak statistical preference for suppressed large-scale temperature power. Finally, we examine the implications of IR cut-off models for large-scale CMB anomalies by analysing the corresponding anomaly statistics within a Bayesian framework.</p>

<p>2026-02-18, <strong>HOLISMOKES XX. Lens models of binary lens galaxies with five images of Supernova Winny</strong>, L. R. Ecker et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16620v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.16620v1</a></p>

<p>Strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) provide a powerful way to study cosmology, SNe and galaxies. Modelling the lens system is key to extracting astrophysical and cosmological information. We present adaptive-optics-assisted high-resolution images of SN Winny (SN 2025wny) in the J and K filters obtained with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The LBT imaging confirms the presence of a fifth point source, whose colour is consistent with that of the other SN images at similar phases, while lens modelling robustly supports its interpretation as an additional image of SN~Winny. We measure the positions of the five SN images with uncertainties varying between 1 and 14 milliarcseconds. We build the first mass models using lenstronomy and GLEE, and explore three classes of mass models for the two lens galaxies G1 and G2. The optimal model class of the three is a singular isothermal ellipsoid for G1, a singular isothermal sphere for G2, and an external shear. We infer the enclosed masses within the Einstein radius as 4.61^{+0.06}_{-0.04} \times 10^{11}\,M_\odot for G1 and 1.01\pm0.02 \times 10^{11}\,M_\odot for G2. The lensing configuration by the two lens galaxies can produce two additional magnified SN images beyond the five observed ones; the exclusion of such model configurations further constrains the lens model parameters. Our model fits to the observed image positions with an RMS of ~0.0012” - 0.0025”, within the observed positional uncertainties. The predicted magnifications of the multiple images vary between ~1.6 (for the faintest fifth image E) to ~10 (for the brightest image A). The predicted relative lensing magnifications of the multiple images do not match that of the observed within 2σuncertainties. The differences in the relative magnifications could be due to millilensing/microlensing. Our mass models form the basis for future analyses of this unique system. (abridged)</p>

<p>2026-02-18, <strong>The Enigmatic Type Icn Supernova 2024abvb Located ~22 kpc from Its Host Galaxy</strong>, J. Shi et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16227v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.16227v1</a></p>

<p>We report multiwavelength observations of the highly offset (~22.4 kpc) SN 2024abvb, the sixth Type Icn supernova to date. With a peak magnitude of Mr = -19.55 +/- 0.11 mag, it is among the most luminous in the existing sample and shows similar colours and decline rates to other SNe Icn. The early optical spectra show a blue continuum with narrow C II features (vFWHM ~ 2000 km s^-1), consistent with a typical wind velocity of a Wolf-Rayet star. The absence of C III lambda 5696 emission at the time of explosion is consistent with a Type Ibn supernova; however, the lack of narrow He lines in both the optical and near-infrared spectra supports a SNe Icn classification. Unlike the majority of SNe Icn, we do not detect broad features in the late-time (7-21 days relative to o-band peak) spectral phase of SN 2024abvb. Semi-analytical modelling of the light curves shows that it can be reproduced by ~2.6 Msun of SN ejecta interacting with ~0.3 Msun of circumstellar material (CSM), both larger than other SNe Icn but consistent with rapidly evolving SNe Ibn. The metallicity at the SN location is significantly lower than the global metallicity of its host galaxy, suggesting that line-driven mass loss required to strip the progenitor of its H and He envelopes was likely inefficient. We estimate the star-formation-rate history at the location of SN 2024abvb and find that it lies at the bottom ~5th percentile among SESNe hosts, inconsistent with a Wolf-Rayet progenitor. Based on its spectral features, local and host environment properties, and host-galaxy offset, we favour an 8-10 Msun star stripped by a compact companion as the progenitor, with a sufficient runaway velocity to reach the observed offset.</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>Between Plateaus and Slopes: A Data-Driven Exploration of Spectral Diversity Across Type IIP/L Supernovae</strong>, Géza Csörnyei et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15788v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15788v1</a></p>

<p>Type II supernovae (SNe II) have been traditionally separated into several subgroups based on their photometric and spectroscopic properties, but whether these represent distinct progenitors or a continuous distribution remains debated. Over the past decade, growing observational evidence has suggested a possible continuity between slow- (IIP) and fast-declining (IIL) SNe. We investigate the continuity of the SNe IIP/L subclasses through a data-driven statistical analysis of spectral time series, aiming to determine whether significant correlations exist between overall spectral shapes and light-curve decline rates. We introduce a novel standardization method for SN II spectra. After empirically flattening the spectra via continuum normalization, we interpolate the resulting “feature spectra” onto a fixed grid of epochs using Gaussian Process regression. The interpolated spectra are then analyzed using Principal Component Analysis to explore correlations. We find that SNe IIP and IIL form a continuum spectroscopically, though some clustering remains. The spectral diversity is characterized mainly by two components: one continuous group with well-defined P-Cygni profiles and another with “less-regular” features likely driven by enhanced circumstellar material (CSM) interaction. Our results reveal that the spectral diversity of SNe IIP/L diminishes over time. We confirm observational correlations: steeper light-curve declines correspond to weaker spectral features, indicating that SNe IIL tend to show weaker emission and, in some cases, a lack of distinct absorption lines. These trends seemingly break down by enhanced CSM interaction that affects the P-Cygni profiles. Our data-driven method reveals underlying spectral correlations and supports a continuous distribution between IIP and IIL subtypes. This method paves the way for more refined classification algorithms.</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>Aligned and misaligned metallicity gradients in young stars and star-forming regions in the EAGLE discs</strong>, Isha Shailesh et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15604v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15604v1</a></p>

<p>Disc galaxies exhibit radial metallicity gradients in both their stellar and gaseous components. The star-forming gas (SFG) in HII regions and young stars (YSs) trace the recent evolutionary history of the galaxy. We aim to assess the extent to which the joint analysis of metallicity gradient alignment in YSs and SFG can constrain the recent evolutionary history of galaxies. Using the high-resolution run of the EAGLE project, we derived radial, azimuthally averaged oxygen abundance profiles for YSs (age &lt; 2 Gyr) and SFG and measured their gradients as the slopes of linear fits to these profiles. We classified galaxies into four groups based on the signs (N for negative and P for positive) of the slopes: NN, NP, PP, and PN (the first letter is for YSs and the second for SFG). We found that galaxies with NN, NP, PP, and PN combinations of metallicity profiles reflect different evolutionary paths over the past ~ 2 Gyr. NN galaxies exhibit sustained inside-out growth accompanied by high star formation efficiency, whereas NP and PP systems show evidence of recent or ongoing feedback-driven disruption, with PP galaxies likely being predominantly shaped by supernova feedback. PN galaxies, by contrast, show evidence of past violent events followed by gradient recovery, highlighting the interplay between inflows, feedback, and gas cooling in shaping metallicity distributions. The degree of alignment between the stellar and gas metallicity gradients provides a way to time the occurrence of significant events in the evolutionary history of galaxies, which contribute through a combination of gas inflows, star formation triggering, and metal mixing. They could also serve as probes of sub-grid physics when observations provide suitable comparison datasets. [Abridged]</p>

<p>2026-02-17, <strong>A Quantum Genetic Algorithm with application to Cosmological Parameters Estimation</strong>, Giuseppe Sarracino et.al., <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15459v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2602.15459v1</a></p>

<p>An Amplitude-Encoded Quantum Genetic Algorithm (AEQGA) has been developed to minimize $χ^2$ functions of different cosmological probes (Supernovae Type Ia, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation), to find the best-fit value for two cosmological parameters, namely the Hubble Constant and the density matter content of the Universe today. Our main aim is to pave the way to testing the adoption of quantum optimization in the inference of the cosmological parameters that describe the universe evolution. AEQGA computes the merit function classically, and then uses a quantum circuit to entangle the population and perform crossover and mutation operations. The results show consistency with the isocontours of the objective functions. We then tested the general behavior of AEQGA as a function of its hyperparameters and compared it with a second quantum genetic algorithm found in the literature as well as with classical algorithms, finding consistent results.</p>
